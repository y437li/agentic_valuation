Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's conference call to review 2014 first quarter earnings call. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation. Gale E. Klappa: Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.76 a share for last year's first quarter. The results were much stronger during the first 3 months of this year, primarily because of the extreme winter weather that gripped our service area. In fact, we delivered more natural gas to our customers during the first quarter of 2014 than during any other quarter in history. We exceeded the previous record for gas deliveries set in the first quarter of 2008 by more than 11%. On the generation side of our business, our newest coal units, the expansion units at our Oak Creek site, performed exceptionally well. And total sales of power from our generating fleet, over and above the demand from our retail and wholesale customers, were up more than 157% in the first quarter. The margin on these sales helps our customers by reducing our fuel costs, and the capacity helps to keep the lights on and energy flowing throughout the region. Now as all of you know, the price of natural gas in the Midwest spiked pretty significantly during the first quarter. We estimate that our new generating units saved our customers more than $42 million in fuel costs this quarter because the units ran on coal as compared to natural gas. Ladies and gentlemen, this is another compelling example of the value of fuel diversity. Our distribution network also performed very well during the harshest winter conditions that we've seen in more than 30 years. And as we saw, our deliver the future program provides some early dividends for our customers. As part of deliver the future, we accelerated the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines on our network. These are the very lines that are the most susceptible to problems and leaks, given severe cold weather. Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.9% in March and remains well below the national average. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since 2008. With a bit brighter economic backdrop, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by 1.6% in the first quarter. We saw strength in several sectors, including paper manufacturing, food processing, rubber and plastics and chemical production. In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are currently up 4.4%, and new natural gas installations are up by more than 7%. This reflects a rebound in home building in our region and the volume of customers who are switching from propane to natural gas. Next, I'd like to update you on 2 of our larger construction projects that we have underway. First, you'll recall that we're planning to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley, of course, generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I'm pleased to report that we received final approval from the Wisconsin Commission in March, and we've issued a full notice to proceed to our general contractor. We plan to complete the conversion of 2 boilers at the Valley plant in 2014 and the remaining 2 boilers in 2015. We're projecting the costs to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. You may recall that in March of last year, we also began a major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. This pipeline replacement project has an estimated cost of $26 million and is on time and on budget. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. Next, I'd like to touch on the work we have underway to upgrade our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. In October of last year, we began building a new powerhouse at the Twin Falls site on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912. It's licensed to operate until the year 2040, but the existing powerhouse badly needs repair. We considered several alternatives but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity that meets current federal standards. Since our last update, engineering and preconstruction activities have begun and major construction activity will begin in the next few weeks. Work to excavate rock and build cofferdams is scheduled for completion this year. We expect the new powerhouse will then be operational in 2015 and the existing powerhouse to be removed in 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Switching gears now. Our board, as you may recall, has authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock from 2014 through 2017. This is the second phase of our repurchase program. You may recall that our board had previously authorized the purchase of up to $300 million of common stock from 2011 through 2013. So in the first quarter of this year, we purchased approximately 426,000 shares. In total, since our buyback program began, we've repurchased 8,103,000 shares at a cost of $296.4 million. This equates to an average purchase price of $36.58 a share. And as we've previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that trends to a 65% to 70% payout ratio in 2017. This policy should support annual dividend increases of 7% to 8% from 2015 to 2017, as we move to a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. In January, our board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.39 a share, an increase of 30% over the dividend that was paid during 2012. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.56 a share. Next, I'd like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see in our core business as we focus on delivering the future. As we previously reported, our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2014 through 2018. In this 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments is shifting away from the higher-profile projects such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and larger quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. For the next 5 years, we will focus on pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations, the building blocks of our delivery business. Between now and the end of '18, we plan to rebuild 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines that are today more than 50 years old. We also intend to replace 18,500 power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds of substation components. On the natural gas side of our business, we plan to replace 1,100 miles of vintage plastic and steel gas mains, as well as 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000 meter sets. Of course, the primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable, given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as one of the most reliable utilities in America. So we'll keep you posted as these needed infrastructure upgrades move forward. We're also making excellent progress, I'm pleased to report, on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted, you may recall, to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers $25 million to $50 million a year in fuel cost, depending on the mix. In May of last year, we received all the environmental approvals we need and began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant. Test results continue to be promising. Further testing is scheduled to identify equipment modifications that could be needed to permanently increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal used at the Oak Creek expansion units. If significant modifications are required, we expect to seek approval from the Wisconsin Commission in late 2014. On the natural gas side of our business, we're planning to build a new natural gas lateral in west-central Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Commission has scheduled technical and public hearings for mid-May on this project, and we anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of this year. The 85 mile line would run from Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in Monroe County. The project will address reliability concerns in Western Wisconsin and meet growing demand. Demand is being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in the region. I might add that all 10 communities along our preferred route have now passed resolutions authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders. If we receive timely approval, we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project is expected to cost between $150 million and $170 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. This winter's bitter cold simply underscores the need to expand our natural gas distribution network in the western part of the state. You may have read there were serious propane shortages across the region, and as I mentioned, we delivered more natural gas to customers during the first quarter of this year than during any other quarter in history. We're also pursuing and launching another potential investment opportunity, the potential sale of the state of Wisconsin's electric and steam-generating plants. Last year, Governor Walker signed into law a new state budget. That budget includes a provision expanding the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric steam and chilled water production and distribution facilities. The state is moving forward and is now in the final stages of selecting a financial advisor and a broker for the potential sale of a number of assets, including the plants. No formal timetable has been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect it would occur in 2015. Turning now to Wisconsin regulatory matters. In May, we plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission that will cover our investment and our projected expenses for the 2015 and 2016 test years. And finally, before closing my remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our operations in Michigan. Under Michigan law, retail customers may choose an alternative energy supplier. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales. But the law excludes from this cap the iron ore mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The 2 iron ore mines that we were serving on a low-margin, interruptible tariff switched to an alternative supplier in September of 2013. Several smaller retail customers have switched as well. Of course, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions regardless of the power supplier. We've taken and will continue to take multiple steps to address this situation. We filed a request with MISO, the mid-continent grid operator, to suspend the operation of all 5 of our units at the Presque Isle Power Plant. Last fall, however, MISO determined that all the units are necessary to maintain reliability in Northern Michigan. As a result, we're eligible for system support resource payments from MISO to recover our costs for operating the units. Under our agreement, MISO will pay us an availability fee to ensure that the units are maintained and available to run and a fee to cover our costs when the units are actually operating. On April 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted our 1-year agreement with MISO. The payments will be retroactive to February 1 of this year. It's also important to note that we will need to invest in environmental upgrades at the Presque Isle plant to meet EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by 2016. Since we expect the units will still be needed for reliability at that time, we anticipate the cost of these upgrades will be reimbursed through an agreement with MISO. So in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, our company is off to a strong start, both financially and operationally, in 2014. And now for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, the famous Pat Keyes. James Patrick Keyes : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share compared with $0.76 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2013. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $381.8 million as compared to $321 million in 2013. That's an increase of $60.8 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $292.7 million for 2014, an increase of $62.1 million over the first quarter of 2013. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we estimate that our electric and gas margins improved by $32.6 million because of the weather. We experienced temperatures that were 24% colder than normal and 16% colder than last year. Our earnings were also helped by $14.2 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant. Last year, we could not recognize the grant income until the plant was complete. Finally, our utility nonfuel operations and maintenance costs are down by $13 million, driven in large part by lower pension and medical costs. Now turning to our nonutility segment. Operating income in this segment was down $1.4 million when compared to 2013. Last year, we recorded onetime entries to reflect the final approval of our Power the Future plant cost in the last Wisconsin rate case. Making the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight improvement in corporate and other, you arrive at the $60.8 million increase in operating income. During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $17.3 million, an increase of $700,000 over the same period last year. These earnings are in line with our expectations. Our other income net declined by $3.3 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased as a result of the completion of the biomass plant last November. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.7 million, primarily because of lower debt levels. Our debt at the end of this quarter was $56.4 million lower than at the end of last year's first quarter. Consolidated income tax expense rose by $29.9 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $207.6 million of net income for the first quarter 2014 or earnings of $0.91 per share. Our earnings per share also were helped by approximately $0.01 because of our share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $385.1 million, which is a $54.8 million increase from 2013. The increase came primarily from higher net income and a better working capital position. Our capital expenditures totaled $129.2 million in the first quarter, a $4.4 million decrease compared to 2013. We saw slightly lower expenditures because construction of the biomass project was completed in 2013. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of March. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid securities is common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. The projected year-end debt to total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2013 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $88.1 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of $10.3 million over the first quarter last year. Dividends for 2014 equate to an annual rate of $1.56 per share. And as shown in the earnings package on our website, retail deliveries of electricity rose by 3.6% in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the first quarter of 2013. Our normalized first quarter sales were up by 1.7%. Looking at the individual customer segments, with the extremely cold weather, we saw actual residential sales up 5.8%, and on a normalized basis, residential sales were up 1.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, we saw quarterly delivery sales up 3.8%, and on a normalized basis, sales of small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.8%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, on a normalized basis, delivery sales for the first quarter of 2014 were up 1.6%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales were up 1.8%. Overall, these results are ahead of our expectations. First quarter retail natural gas sales were up nearly 19% compared to the first quarter of 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 3.2%. These results are also ahead of our expectations for the year. Turning now to our earnings forecast. First, we are raising our 2014 guidance. Our prior guidance was $2.53 a share to $2.63 a share. Our revised guidance is $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. While our first quarter clearly exceeded our expectations, we still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. So again, our revised guidance for 2014 is $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. And for the second quarter, our guidance is $0.49 a share to $0.51 a share. This assumes normal weather. Our second quarter guidance is slightly lower than the $0.52 we earned in the second quarter of 2013 due to the timing of operations and maintenance expense and fuel recoveries. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa: Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : This is actually Paul Zimbardo for Julien. Just a quick question on the plant in the environmental recovery. Could you provide kind of a little background there and time line, if you could? Gale E. Klappa: The plant in the environmental -- are you talking about... Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : The SSR in Presque Isle. Gale E. Klappa: Yes, okay. Let me frame it for you and Allen can give you some of the details. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one way to look at this really is that MISO, the Midwest grid operator, has basically become the principal customer for that plant. So MISO, under our agreement and with approval from FERC, is basically paying us to operate the plant. Now the plant will become subject to the new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by 2016. So environmental investments will be needed if the plant is going to continue to operate. Allen? Allen L. Leverett: Right. And Julian (sic) [Paul], that's of course, the MATS rule that we have to be in compliance with by April of 2016. So our expectation would be that we would be able to do dry sorbent injection at the plant. Cost range for that, when we were doing some testing in June, but I would expect that the range of costs for that in terms of a capital investment is $6 million to $12 million is a likely range, if we had to do dry sorbent injection for all 5 units, if MISO wanted us to maintain all 5 of the units. And then as Gale mentioned just now and in the script, our expectation would be that those dollars would be recovered in a system support resource agreement with MISO. Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. So a total of $6 million to $12 million for all of the units [ph]? Allen L. Leverett: Yes. So if we had to put DSI, if they wanted us to maintain all 5, $6 million to $12 million for all 5, Julien (sic) [Paul]. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Well, I was going to have -- the first question is, how many points are you going to give me on that Green Baby? Gale E. Klappa: We'll negotiate. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : My second question is, when we think about your long-term articulated earnings growth aspiration, Gale, should we still be thinking about it off of the original guidance? Or should we be basing our expectations off of the new guidance, taking into account the weather and the accounting -- the treasury grant and those other items? Gale E. Klappa: On the 4 to 6? Okay. Well, really, Greg, as you know, the weather can move us in one direction or another pretty quickly. So I would suggest you maintain your look in terms of the longer-term growth rate of our normal guidance of 4% to 6% -- or of our guidance of 4% to 6% EPS growth based on normal weather. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : I'm just curious, on the increased guidance, is it all weather related? Or is it also a piece of -- a component of that is how that weather-normalized sales are tracking ahead of your expectations? Gale E. Klappa: Well, first, I'd like to know what you did with Pat at that dinner. But anyway, you're talking about our revised guidance for the remainder of 2014? Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Correct. Gale E. Klappa: Basically, what we've done is taken into account some impact from the weather. On the other hand, we know we're going to see some additional operation and maintenance expenses, gas leak inspections and other distribution network work that has got to be carried on is going to raise our O&M some going forward. So in essence, what we've done is tempered our look at Q1, knowing that there are going to be some additional O&M coming down the pike and raise our guidance slightly as you saw. So basically, weather-driven offset by what we know is going to be some higher O&M. Pat? James Patrick Keyes : Gale, I think that you nailed it. I think that's the main points, Brian. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And I think your long-term weather-normalized sales forecast is 0.7%. Should we bump that up to what we've seen in the first quarter? Or is it still too early for that? Gale E. Klappa: Way too early for that, Brian. As you know, the weather normalization techniques in our industry tend to fall apart or tend to be less accurate when you get into the tail, when you get beyond 2 standard deviations. And I think with this weather in the first quarter, we were like 8 standard deviations away from norm. So I wouldn't read too much into weather normalization for Q1, and I think our roughly 0.5% projection for the normal growth is still pretty accurate. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then do you plan on issuing any debt at the utility in 2014? Gale E. Klappa: We will ask Mr. -- we do have some maturities, but in fact one where we had a bond offering just matured, so we do have some plans. James Patrick Keyes : Yes, Brian, we got a couple of things coming. At Wisconsin Electric, the WEPCo side, we had a bond mature last month. So I would say -- and that was about $300 million, I would say some time in the second quarter, we're optimistic it might go a little later, but let's just say second quarter, we'll probably do something around that size. And then you may recall that last year, we had a bond mature at Wisconsin Gas, I think that was $45 million, $50 million in that zip code. We've been able to manage that but we anticipate that some time, probably the third quarter, in the neighborhood of $100 million, we will probably do something at Wisconsin Gas this year at well -- as well, excuse me. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then just lastly, the fuel costs and the 2% dead band, where did you guys end up at the end of the quarter? Gale E. Klappa: At the end of the quarter, we're above the dead band. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. I would just imagine the off-system sales are helping to support that. Gale E. Klappa: No question about that, absolutely. In fact, as you probably heard me say in the script, our off-system sales were up 157%. I mean, really, our units, I'm very pleased with how our units performed. And the Valley of our new Oak Creek units was absolutely completely visible during Q1. And MISO asked those units to run at the top virtually every single day of Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : Remind me, filing rate cases in Wisconsin, do you -- the test year, is it a forward or backward test year? And does weather get adjusted out? Gale E. Klappa: Well, as you may recall, Kit, and then you look at 50 different states, so it's hard to recall specifically, they're one of the few in the country with a 2-year forward-looking test year. So what we are doing now in finalizing all of the data, we will be looking at and filing our projected investment and our projected expenses for the years 2015 and 2016. So that is basically the standard approach in Wisconsin. I think it's a constructive approach because you're not actually looking back with a lot of lag. You're actually projecting your appropriate expenses for the following 2 years. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : Yes, absolutely. And what is your early -- last go-round, the ROE was not a topic for discussion in the rate case. Is that likely to be repeated? Or should we have a fully litigated situation where ROE is kind of in its traditional central place in a rate case? Gale E. Klappa: Good question, very good question. And let me just say this. There are a lot of discussions going on. Alliant, one of our sister utilities here in Wisconsin, has just entered into a settlement. Now they're, because of a particular situation they have, they're able to keep rates flat for a couple of years. But there, they and the intervenor groups and the commission staff appear to have agreed on a, in essence, setting rates for the electric utility at a 10.2% return. So I think that may be indicative -- we're having some discussions as well about ROE and capital structure. But I would not expect significant change, particularly in light of the first step forward between Alliant and the intervenor groups. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Two questions. One, pretty easy. Can you walk us through -- you mentioned a lot of different items, a lot of different projects and the potential capital costs, including the environmental pollution control equipment at Presque Isle. Is any of that not in your current CapEx guidance that you guys have given out over the last couple of months and put in your 10-K and other data? Gale E. Klappa: Michael, good question. Virtually everything we discussed is in our -- it's like Ragu, it's in there. But we should be very clear about the capital cost that Allen talked about related to Presque Isle, a potential capital cost related to Presque Isle. Those would be costs that we would expect because of the need for those units for reliability to be reimbursed. So I really wouldn't look at that as part of our announced capital budget. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And I apologize, I missed Allen's comments about the level or extent of that capital spend on Presque Isle. Gale E. Klappa: Allen, would you like to repeat? Allen L. Leverett: No, what we said before, Michael, was that it was likely to be $6 million to $12 million. We're doing some testing this summer and so we'll be able to nail down where we're going to be in the range. And that would be for dry sorbent injection. And so that would assume we do all 5 units. If for some reason MISO didn't want all 5 units, well, that $6 million to $12 million range would go down somewhat, Michael, but that's for 5 units. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And Allen, as long as I've got you, can you give an update a little bit on ATC's rate base growth expectation and ATC growth opportunities outside of the state of Wisconsin? Allen L. Leverett: Yes. Well, as we talked a little bit on the -- on our year-end call about ATC's capital budget and for the next 3 years, their capital budget inside the footprint, so this would be for calendar years '14, '15, '16, would be $1.3 billion. So that's unchanged from the estimates that we talked about on our last earnings call. So at that level of spending, when you sort of translate that into net income growth at ATC, Michael, that certainly fully supports the 4% to 6% target that Gale and, I think, Greg Gordon were talking about earlier. In terms of opportunities outside the footprint, the $1.3 billion that I talked about for '14, '15, '16 combined, that doesn't include anything outside the footprint at all. ATC is certainly pursuing things elsewhere in the MISO footprint, pursuing things in the western part of the country. But at this point, Michael, I would not expect any of those investments to materialize, or at least for us to actually employ capital for some of those investments until, say, the '17, '18, '19 timeframe. So I wouldn't put any of those opportunities in sort of the next 36 months or so. They're going to be out a bit. But even without those, they still got a lot of good growth over the next 3 years, even without those opportunities. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And last question, I'll add one on here real quick. Gale, natural gas demand, do you think -- I mean, we're now several quarters for you guys. I mean, if I go back, it's really 3 or 4, 4 or 5 quarters now. Do you think we're seeing a structural shift in what is weather-normalized natural gas demand? And if so, what do you think the new level is? I mean, historically, natural gas demand had been on a long-term downward slope for 15 to 20 years. And I wonder if something's happened that's not weather related but structural that's changing what weather-normalized gas demand is. Gale E. Klappa: Well, I understand your wife likes it hotter, but other than that, Michael, I think that, and not in any way trying to avoid the question, but trying to be absolutely brutally frank with you, the weather has been so abnormal, in particular what we've seen in Q1, that I think we're going to need another year or 2 before we can really determine whether there's any structural change going on here. On the one hand, you see data that indicates that maybe there is a structural change but then on the other hand, gas prices are now higher than they've been in a while. Natural gas prices are now higher than they've been in a while. Last time I looked, at about $4.80 per million BTU. Furnaces, new furnaces are still much more efficient, let's say, a 10- or 15-year-old furnace. There are a lot of competing factors going on here. I think it's going to take a little bit longer before we can really understand if there is any kind of structural change that would reverse the pattern of the past 20 years. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital. James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division : One follow-up to Greg Gordon's question, this 4% to 6% growth. I was a little unclear as to whether or not the base year had been shifted around a little bit. Gale E. Klappa: No, the base year has not shifted. We will take a look, as we enter 2015, about shifting the base year. But right now, the base year stays in place. James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division : So that's 2011, just to confirm. Gale E. Klappa: You're absolutely correct. James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Okay. Second question is my standard capital allocation question. But this time, I have a twist. Gale E. Klappa: A twist? All right. James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Okay. So you know I'm not a fan of you guys buying back stock better than 2x book. But it seems to me that if I did the math correctly, you bought 426,000 shares in the first quarter, and if I just take a simple arithmetic average between year-end price and the March end prize, you're buying back stock in the $44 a share range or $18 million with the stock. And if you've got a new $300 million program in place annualized at $100 million a year, that should be $25 million a quarter. Am I reading anything into the fact that this is now down on what an annualized run rate would be and that you're starting to shy away from buying back stock at these levels? Gale E. Klappa: I've heard the rumor that you're not a fan of buying back stock at 2x books, so I'm glad you admitted this. James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division : In fact, even in print. Gale E. Klappa: I know, exactly. But we can't read everything you see in print, or you can't believe everything you see in print. I'm just giving you a hard time. First of all, one of the things that -- one of our guiding principles has been that as we have positive cash flow materialize, that if we don't have other investment opportunities on the near-term horizon for the use of that cash, then one of our philosophies is, we don't think our shareholders will reward us for just building up cash on the balance sheet. So that's one of our other guiding principles here and I would not read anything into our first quarter activity other than we tend to look at it quarter by quarter as we have cash building up. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar Research. Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Quick question. Any idea on the potential cost of the Oak Creek fuel flexibility program? Or are we still too early in the stages? Gale E. Klappa: Too early, but we've put a bookend around it, again, depending upon the specific equipment modifications that might be needed. Our bookends, and we'll know a lot more later this year, are at a low end, maybe $25 million, $30 million; at the high end, maybe $100 million. Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Great. And then just trying to get a handle on around the growth opportunity for propane customers switching to gas. Can you provide a little more color on the extent of the growth opportunity here and kind of what is the penetration level of current customers so far? Gale E. Klappa: Well, I will say this. In terms of propane consumption, just pure propane consumption, Wisconsin is one of the top 5 states in the country. So I think that gives you a sense of the potential conversion opportunity here. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, even in Q1, which was a pretty brutal time to try to switch furnaces, we saw a 7% increase so far this year in new customer connections to our natural gas network compared to a year ago. So I honestly think the conversion opportunity, particularly in light of what happened to propane pricing, but even more so the severe shortages of propane this past winter, I think the conversion opportunity is perhaps even greater than we thought. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli with Nexus. Bill Appicelli : Just had a follow-up on the Presque Isle issue. I believe you guys have a -- there's an open doc at FERC related to this issue and I was just wondering if you guys could sort of remind me of what your position is or what's trying to be accomplished there? Gale E. Klappa: I'll let Allen give you the details. The open docket at FERC is really about cost allocations. In other words, we have an agreement with MISO on payment of about $52 million for the next 12 months to compensate us for maintaining and operating those units. And then the open docket really relates, as we understand it, to who has to pay MISO for that $52 million. Allen? Allen L. Leverett: No, that's right. I wouldn't add anything to that. Gale E. Klappa: Okay. Bill Appicelli : Okay. And do you guys have any sense of the timing of that or how that would impact, I guess, some of these other decisions you guys were talking about earlier? Allen L. Leverett: Well, the SSR agreement is for 1 year. So it goes from, I think, February 1 of this year to February 1 of next year, and I think MISO has like a 3-month extension option. So if they want us to continue to operate the plant after that, and I expect they will, we'll have to do another SSR agreement. But I would expect, given FERC, they went ahead and let us start -- MISO start charging and MISO start paying us. So I don't really think the fact that there's a review going on at FERC is going to affect any of that. It might take a number of months. We might be to the end of the year before they resolve the allocation question that Gale talked about. But it's not really going to impact our ability to collect dollars from MISO at all. So it's really not an issue for us as we would see it. Bill Appicelli : Okay. But is it an allocation between Michigan and Wisconsin? Allen L. Leverett: Well, it's an issue about interstate, so allocation between the states. And to a certain degree, you'll also get into some allocation issues within Wisconsin. So it's a fairly complicated question about how these costs are ultimately allocated. Gale E. Klappa: In essence, the issue is that in other parts of MISO, these kinds of costs are allocated in a certain way, but within the ATC footprint, they're allocated in a separate way. And the Wisconsin Commission's view is that the allocation that affects -- the allocation in effect, if you were inside the ATC footprint, is punitive to Wisconsin, and that's really the issue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP. Vedula Murti : So all of my questions are actually asked and answered. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Andrew Levi : Just on Bill's question, did the state of Wisconsin intervene on this case? Allen L. Leverett: In the FERC proceeding, Andy, yes, they did. Andrew Levi : And what's their issue? Allen L. Leverett: When you said the state of Wisconsin, the public [indiscernible]. Their issue is allocation. They don't believe that the MISO tariff, as currently structured, provides for a fair allocation as between Wisconsin and Michigan. So that's really their issue. Their issue is not the total cost, it's the allocation of the cost. Gale E. Klappa: In fact, Allen's right, Andy. In fact, in their intervention asking FERC to provide for a different allocation between Wisconsin and Michigan, they actually said that they believe we should be compensated in the way we're being compensated. It's just who has to make that compensation, how much to Michigan, how much to Wisconsin, is the issue. Andrew Levi : And what's the breakdown now? Gale E. Klappa: Well, now, it's close to 90-10. In other words, 90% of these SSR payments will be billed to Wisconsin customers and about 10% to Michigan and that is what has the Wisconsin Commission concerned. They think that that's not a proper allocation, that much more of the cost should go to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Andrew Levi : Okay. But it's not a situation where if FERC rules against them, they don't -- they come after you or anything like that? Gale E. Klappa: No. As Allen said earlier, we don't think this has any impact on the agreement itself and on our -- and on the payments to us for operating the unit. It's just a matter of how is the pie sliced among parties that have to pay MISO for this benefit. Andrew Levi : Right, right. So it's really the PFC fighting FERC, not [ph] fighting you guys? Gale E. Klappa: You could look at it that way. I think what the PFC and Wisconsin... Andrew Levi : Or MISO or however you want to look at it. Gale E. Klappa: Exactly. Really trying to get the MISO tariff or this part of MISO to match up with the rest of MISO because it's different here that -- just the way the cost allocation works. If you're inside the American Transmission Company footprint, that cost allocation is different than all the rest of MISO, and the Wisconsin Commission is saying it needs to be all the same. Andrew Levi : Okay. And then another question. It's the one I think Jim was going to ask. I'm just guessing, but I did want to ask, so I'll ask the question. There's an article earlier in the year... Gale E. Klappa: Is he under the desk, Andy? Andrew Levi : I'm sorry. No, I'm just guessing and I might be wrong, I shouldn't speak for Jim. But there was an article earlier in the year, Bloomberg article relating to you and M&A. And you were name with a myriad of other companies relative to Berkshire Hathaway, and I was just wondering if you want to address that or not. Gale E. Klappa: Andy, as you know, that article, in all likelihood, was based on pure speculation, and over the years, we found it not very productive to comment on speculation. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available at our Investor Relations office, and her direct line is (414) 221-2592. Thanks, again, everybody. Take care.",

Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's quarterly conference call. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale E. Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation. Gale E. Klappa: Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 second quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.58 a share for the second quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.52 a share for last year's second quarter. Despite a cool and a rainy June that significantly reduced customer demand, we delivered solid results. And I must add that cost related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group reduced earnings by a penny a share during the quarter. Turning now to the state of the economy, Wisconsin unemployment rate declined to 5.7% in June and remains well below the national average, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it\u2019s been since 2008. (inaudible) broader economic backdrop deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers excluding the iron ore mines rose by 2.1% in the second quarter. We saw strength in several sectors including paper manufacturing, food products, rubber and plastics and primary metals. In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. The electric service connections are up by 3.6% and the new natural gas installations are up 8.5% compared with the same period year. These gains reflect a bit stronger economy and the volume of customer switching from propane to natural gas. Later in my prepared remarks, I will update you on several positive developments in our core business as well as the progress we are making on the important construction projects we have underway. But first I would like to touch on our recent announcement to acquire Integrys Energy Group. Just to refresh your memory on June 23rd, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combing the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise scale and financial resources to meet the region\u2019s future energy needs. We will be serving 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota in fact the combination will create the eight largest natural gas distribution company in America and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be prudently invested in new and upgraded energy infrastructure. Now as you well aware, we have consistently used three criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition. First, we would have believed that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would need to be largely credit neutral and finally we would have to believe there is a long term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal the Wisconsin Energy\u2019s standalone growth rate. I am pleased to reiterate with you that we believe this combination meets or exceeds all three criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year faster than either one of us projecting on a standalone basis. And importantly more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses. Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with an increased scale and geographic proximity and over the time will enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices system-wide. In addition, as many of you know Integrys today is one of the major owners of American transmission company with a 34.1% interest, Wisconsin Energy is the second largest owner with a 26.2% interest. The combined entity will have a 60% stake and what is the largest independent transmission company in the country. As you may remember, ATC\u2019s ten year plan calls for investing between $3 billion to $3.6 billion, the bolster electric reliability in our region, it\u2019s a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment. Now in light of the acquisition, we have terminated our share repurchase program. The Integrys transaction will allow us to use our strong cash flow will allow us to use our strong cash flow for regulated investments. The proposed dividend policy of the combined company will be designed to keep Integrys shareholders neutral initially after taking into consideration both the stock and cash they will receive. In the period before closing, Wisconsin Energy plans to continue with its current dividend policy and of course that policy calls for 7% to 8% annual increase in our dividend. At closing, we would expect a further dividend increase for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. Then going forward, projected payout target for the combined company will be 65% to 70% of earnings The transaction of course is subject to approvals from the shareholders of both companies and several regulatory agencies. The agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications' Commission, the Public Service Commissions of Wisconsin and Michigan, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The transaction is also subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. We planned to file for approval of the acquisition in each of the four states next week. Filings at the Federal level are expected to be made before the end of August. We anticipate closing the transaction sometime during the second half of 2015. Also you may have seen the announcement this morning from Integrys and Exelon, Exelon\u2019s constellation business unit has agreed to purchase Integrys unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. Exelon will pay $60 million for the Integrys retail operations plus adjusted networking capital at the time of closing. That working capital was about $183 million as of May 31 2014. The Integrys management team plans to provide you with an update during their quarterly earnings call which is now scheduled for August 7. Again, we believe our combination with Integrys will create the premiere regulated utility system in the Midwest with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come, the benefits to all stakeholders and the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value, our clear compelling and achievable. And now turning back to recent developments in Wisconsin Energy core business. On July 18, we have received the final written order from the Wisconsin commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral in the west central Wisconsin. This 85 mile pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County from the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in west central Wisconsin. The project will address reliability concerns in region and meet growing demand. Demand of course has been driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in western Wisconsin. The commission\u2019s approval also includes franchise awards for ten communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those ten communities. We expect to begin construction early next year on the project and complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our projected cost is between $175 million and $185 million excluding allowance for funds used during constructions. On the generation side of our business, you will recall that we are converting the fuel source for our valley power plant from coal to natural gas, the two unit valley plant the cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I am pleased to report to you that the unit one conversion is now well under way. We stopped using coal at the unit in mid July and our scheduled calls for start-up and boiler tuning to begin in October in advance of course of the winter heating season. We plan to have unit one fully converted into natural gas by the end of the year. Valley would be available to operate at full power this winter with the unit one burning natural gas and unit two continuing to burn coal. Unit two is then scheduled to be converted to natural gas during 2015. We expect the total conversion cost to be $65 million to $70 million again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Now you may recall that in March of last year, we also began the major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the Valley facility. This pipeline replacement project has an estimated cost of approximately $30 million and is on time and on budget. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating cost and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts and we believe our plan will help support a vibrate downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. Next, I would like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Twin Falls was built way back in 1912 and it's one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the boarder of Wisconsin and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Construction is underway now to build the new powerhouse and spillway capacity that meets current Federal standards. Since our last updates, we began major construction work which includes building cofferdams and test blasting to prepare for rock excavation. These activities are scheduled for completion later this year; we expect that the new powerhouse will be operational in 2015. We plan to remove the old powerhouse during 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million again excluding allowance for funds used during constructions. We are also making just excellent progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were originally permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers $25 million to $50 million a year depending on the mix. Last year we received environmental permits began making changes to the boilers and testing of blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant. And just a few weeks ago on July 7, we took the next step and filed the request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve $25 million of additional capital spending for modifications at the plant. If approved, these modifications will enable testing of up to 100% PRB coal. However, I should point out that to operate the units above at 20% PRB blend on a sustain basis further investment will be needed in fuel storage and handling equipment. Just the reminder, our end goal is to have the flexibility at the new Oak Creek units to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal up to 100%. Next, I would like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see as we focus on delivering the future. As we have previously reported to you, our capital budget calls for spending between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the five year period between now and 2018. In this five year budget, the nature of our capital spending is shifting away from large projects such as our power the future units, renewable generation of larger quality controls. Instead our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will continue to improve our generation and upgrade our aging distribution networks, over the next five years will have a much greater focus on pipes, polls, wires, transformers, and sub-stations, the building blocks of our delivery business. The primary risk associated with these projects are naturally more manageable even with the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work but this work is no less valuable or important than the mega projects we have completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status is one of the most reliable utilities in America. So we will keep you posted as these needed infrastructure projects move forward. We are also monitoring another investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin generation plants. Last year, you will recall Governor Walker signed in the law a new state budget. That budget includes a provision expanding the state\u2019s authority to sell or lease certain state on properties. This means that the administration has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric, steam and chilled water generation and distribution facilities. Financial advisors have now been selected by the state and an asset broker has been named for the potential sale of the plants. No formal timetable has yet been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect that would occur in 2015. Turning now to Wisconsin regulatory matters, in May we reached the rate settlement facilitated by the Wisconsin Commission staff with three major customer groups, the settlement covers return on equity, capital structure and base rate changes for the forward looking test years 2015 and 2016. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, Wisconsin Electric will have a return on equity of 10.2% with no change and its capital structure. Wisconsin Gas will have a return on equity of 10.3% with a higher equity component in its capital structure. The equity midpoint for Wisconsin thus would increase from 47.5% to 49.5%. Based on the settlement nonfuel electric rates will increase by 1.4% beginning in 2015, we expect these changes to be effective on January 1st. During the final months of this year, the remainder of the rate case will focus on rate design and on 2015 fuel cost recovery and with that \u2013 with that long update I would be happy to turn the things over to our Chief Financial Officer Pat Keyes, who will provide you more details on our second quarter results, Pat? James Patrick Keyes : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 second quarter earnings were $0.58 a share as compared with $0.52 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2013. Cost related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter. Now consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $240.7 million as compared with $229.5 million in 2013. That's an increase of $11.2 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $155.2 million for 2014, an increase of $16.3 million over the second quarter of 2013. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, utility operations and maintenance cost declined by $40 million primarily because of lower medical, pension and other post employment benefit costs. Our earnings were also helped by $13.8 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant. Our second quarter 2014 earnings were hurt by a cool west spring, we estimate that our electric and gas margins declined by $5 million as a result of the weather. We also saw increased depreciation cost of $4.6 million primarily because of the biomass plant that was placed on a service in the fourth quarter of 2013. Combining these and other factors results in a $16.3 million increase in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2014 as compared with the same quarter in the prior year. Operating income in our nonutility segment was $91.7 million which is right in line with the prior year. Our corporate and other segment which includes corporate costs and smaller affiliates recorded $5.2 million with an increased cost in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the second quarter 2013. The increased costs are directly related to the proposed acquisition of the Integrys Group. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the $11.2 million increase in operating income. During the second quarter, earnings from our investment in the American transmission company totaled $17.5 million, an increase of $200,000 over the same period last year. These earnings are in line with our expectation. Our other income net increased by $2.3 million. During the second quarter 2014 we\u2019ve recognized gains in the sale of property in our west part subsidiary and land sales in the utility. Our net interest expense decreased by $4.3 million primarily because of lower debt levels and more average interest rates. Over the past year, we were able to issue long-term debt at interest rates at the lower than the maturing debt. Consolidated income tax expense rose by $4 million because of higher pretax earnings partially offset by a slightly lower tax rate for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $133 million of net income for the first second quarter 2014 or earnings of $0.58 per share. Again, these earnings include just over a penny of cost associated with the acquisition of Integrys. During the first six months of 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $721.3 million which is a $39.8 million increase from the first six months of 2013. We have collected $76.2 million this year related to the treasury grant. This benefit was partially offset by higher working capital requirements. Our capital expenditures totaled $305.5 million in the first six months of 2014; $1.8 million decrease compared it to 2013. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of June. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid securities is common equity which is consistent with past presentations. Earlier in the year, we projected that our year-end debt-to-total capital will be relatively flat with our 2013 year-end ratio of 52.5%. Now with the termination of share repurchase program, we expect to see our year end debt to total capital below to last year's ratio. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for 401-K plan, options and other programs. We also paid $176 million in common dividends in the first six months of 2014, an increase of $20.4 million over the same period last year. Dividends for 2014 equate to an annual rate of $1.56 per share. Retail deliveries of electricity rose by 3% in the first half of 2014 as compared to first half of 2013. Our normalized first half deliveries were up by 2.3%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential deliveries up 1.2% on a normalized basis which were flat with 2013. Across our small commercial industrial group, we saw year-to-date deliveries up 9% to 10%, another normalized basis, we were down two times of percent. In the large commercial industrial segment on a normalized basis, deliveries for the first half of 2014 were up by 6.6%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines we were up 2%. Overall these results are in line with our expectations. First half retail natural gas sales were up 13.8% compared to the first half of 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 2.5%. Results from our natural gas delivery business are ahead of our expectations for the year. Moving to other items of interest, in May of 2014 our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million, 30 year bond at a coupon of 4.25%. This bond is essentially replaced by $300 million bond with a coupon of 6% that came due in April. Turing now to our earnings forecast. We are maintaining our 2014 guidance of $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. Our 2014 guidance excludes cost related to the Integrys acquisition. While our results for the first half of the year exceeded our expectations, we have had a very cool summer. As many of you know we typically see our largest cooling demand during the warm summer days of July. However, we only have had four July since 1960 that have been cooler than the July of 2014. In fact Milwaukee has not seen a single 90 degree day this summer. So taking into account this cool July weather and looking at the continued cool forecast in August our third quarter guidance is $0.48 a share to $0.50 a share. This too excludes cost associated with the Integrys acquisition. Our third quarter guidance also reflects lower fuel recoveries as compared to the same quarter in 2013. These are largely timing issues that were factored into our 2014 fuel plant. So again, the range for our third quarter guidance is $0.48 a share to $0.50 a share and with that I will turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa: Pat, thank you very much let me zip up my parka before we go into the Q&A. Overall folks were on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : Now we would like to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa: Rock and roll Greg how are you? Greg Gordon - ISI Group : I am doing great, Gale. How are you? Gale E. Klappa: We are good. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: So one question you may not be able to answer but the Integrys announced the sale of their retail business -- the press release hit last night. I know you are at arm\u2019s length on that when you look at the price that was announced, was that consistent with your understanding of the economics? Does it has anything to do \u2013 affect in any way the economics of your transaction or was it in line with your expectations? Gale E. Klappa: Greg, very good question, certainly. In my conversations with my counterpart of Integrys we were supportive of the sale and the results as you saw published this morning in the new release were quite consistent with our expectations. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Great and I have a couple of questions that are probably CFO level questions. When I look at the revenues you have generated year-to-date from the different customer classes, electric revenues look more or less consistent in residential small commercial is the same as large commercial industrial is obviously down on bunch unrealized revenue and then it's more than offset by significant improvements in resell and other, so an you talk about what is driving that shift and how we should think about that prospectively? Gale E. Klappa: Well, Pat and Scott are thinking, are you saying that those questions are above or below my pay-grade, which? Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Yes, the answer is yes. James Patrick Keyes : Greg, Scott and me take team a little bit. But to get the \u2013 we talked in the first couple calls about opportunity of sales and if you look at the year-to-date we did quite well in the beginning of the year. And that's certainly driving a part of it and Scott do you want to add color to that at all or? Scott Lauber : Yes the opportunity of sales are there but also on our other operating revenues we have the payment with the SSR payments for (inaudible) power plant. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Okay and the large commercial industrial falloff is the iron ore mines? James Patrick Keyes : On the sales side, yes. That\u2019s why we kind of with the mine decision last year we started reporting both sales and deliveries. So with the mines decision the sales numbers will fall commensurately but we kept the delivery numbers there so you kind of have an apples to apples to prior year on how much we are delivering. Gale E. Klappa: The sales would include the generation side of the business; deliveries because we are still delivering electricity of the mines would include just total deliveries to all of our customers. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Understood and then the treasury grants are significant portion of your earnings contribution this year. Is the way that's going to work is when the plant comes up and running, treasury grants are going to sort of stop coming in but the plant will actually start earning and so you won\u2019t see any significant sort of fluctuation in earnings. How is that going to work? Gale E. Klappa: That one is not below my pay grade so let me give you the facts on that and then Steve Dickson can help me if there is anything obscure. But essentially last year while the plant was under contraction, we were delivering the customer\u2019s bill credits from the Federal tax grant that we expected to receive from the treasury department for building a biomass unit. Where the accounting rules worked, we basically took a three center share hit because we were actually paying cash credit on bills to customers in each of the first three quarters of 2013. So $0.03 in each of those three quarters, then when the plant went commercial, we completed the plant on time and on budget and brought it into service in November of last year, under the accounting rules we were able to book the grant. So there was a true up in Q4 of last year if you will, I think it was $0.09 pickup Steven in Q4 of last year. So forwarding that Greg, to our second quarter results this year, we didn't have any negative impact from the bill credits and we did last year. So we had three cent a share pick up in Q2 of this year because of the accounting rules compared to Q2 of last year. Am I making sense Greg? Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Hundred percent and how long do those treasury grant run through the P&L? Gale E. Klappa: I think two years. Steve Dickson : Yes in the right case we are going to give back to Wisconsin customers over a two year period and that will end in December of 2014. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Got you and so it will all come out in the wash so to speak when you do your rate design in new requirements for the next \u2013 Gale E. Klappa: Absolutely. This will all come up -- this will all be completed basically before the new effective test year of January 2015. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.: Completely understood. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa: You are welcome, Greg. Good questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please go ahead with your question. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC: Hi. Good afternoon guys. Gale E. Klappa: How are you doing Kit? Kit Konolige - BGC: Good. So just pretty simple old fashioned utility kind of question. So you have indicated that your level of sales was in line with expectations. So it looks like residential sales are kind of flat, flat to down for the first half or they were down in the first quarter and flat in the second? Gale E. Klappa: Yes? Kit Konolige - BGC: So what are you seeing there, I mean we have seen there is some other companies, is this any further deterioration in kind of customer usage by customer or just efficiency better refrigerators or tightness in spending on electricity because of the economy or what do we think is going on out there? Gale E. Klappa: We thought about this profoundly and I think it's not enough beer in the refrigerator yet. Kit Konolige - BGC: That\u2019s a big problem in your service territory. Gale E. Klappa: Exactly. Well I will give you my view for what it\u2019s worth. First of all, when you look at our first half, I think it's fair to say that when you compare it to our projection for the year we were expecting retail sales in total to be up about one-half of 1%. But then when you break that down by customer group, large industrial, well actually I think did a little better than expectations both in Q1 and Q2 from industrial demand for electricity and I think we were up 2% Scott in Q1 compared to the first quarter year ago on industrial demand for electricity and 2.1% second quarter compared to Q2 of a year ago. So, again breaking down our kind of expectations better than we thought on industrial demand. When you look at small commercial and industrial, maybe a little less than we thought, it's pretty flat and then on residential it's flat, however, that\u2019s on a weather normal basis. And again we had such abnormal weather in the first quarter that I think you have to just take for now our weather normalization with the grain of salt. Remember we have talked before Kit that when weather gets beyond the second standard deviation from normal, the industry's weather normalization techniques tend to break down. So I wouldn't read too much into it one way or another. The only I think interesting and perhaps hopeful fact coming out of the first half numbers for us in terms of demand for electricity as the uptake from industrial customers. Scott do you like? Scott Lauber : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Kit Konolige - BGC: Sounds good. Okay just one other area for me and that is I might have missed some of this but what\u2019s the schedule for the state sale of generation? Gale E. Klappa: There have been no formal announcement of the schedule yet, however the state has hired both financial advisors and the broker and they have made that announcement just in the last probably I believe in June. So if there is a sale going forward of state assets we would expect that to be a 2015 event. Kit Konolige - BGC: That would be 2015, when would you expect to hear from the state or to see it published whether they are or aren\u2019t going ahead with it? Gale E. Klappa: Again there\u2019ve been no real indications from the state other than the fact that they believe they\u2019ve made a major step forward in terms of interviewing and hiring specific financial advisors and a broker. Now one complicating factor is that they really are looking at the potential sale of a number of different types of properties though they have hired financial advisors for each type of property as well broker for the potential sale of the plants themselves. So they are really trying to organize a much broader potential sale of property than just the power plant themselves. Kit Konolige - BGC: Very good. Okay. Thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa: You are welcome Kit. I appreciate your call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa: How is Cleveland Paul? Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Cleveland rocks. Gale E. Klappa: Alright, I wonder that happened, I am sorry go ahead Paul. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Last year you did $0.60 in the third you and now you are guiding it down $0.11 to midpoint despite the $0.03 pick up from the tax. Can you just run through the big drivers is it all weather, sorry if I missed that? Gale E. Klappa: It\u2019s really two things and Pat can elaborate if he would like to it\u2019s really weather? We\u2019ll its four things, the first three are weather. I mean literally this has been one of the coldest Julys on record in Wisconsin. I think Pat mentioned in his portion of the prepared remarks, the weather forecast was saying we will not have a single 90 degree day this entire summer in Wisconsin. I\u2019m figuring if this continues Paul we\u2019re going to be at 30 below in October. I mean really it has been incredibly cool and honest to goodness the weather forecast for August looks to be a repeat of July in terms of way colder than normal. So we\u2019ve tried to take into account what we know has occurred in July which is just incredible lack of demand for air conditioning for obvious reasons and extrapolate that to August and then of course there is some timing Pat on fuel recovery. James Patrick Keyes : That's right, Gale. Does that answer your question Paul I can dive in more if you like but that's \u2013 I think that\u2019s the bulk of it. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: How big is the fuel piece? James Patrick Keyes : Round numbers $0.02, $0.03. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Okay and then just kind of assuming you close Integrys, you own 60% of ATC, how will that pull to your income statement at that point? Gale E. Klappa: I will ask Alan to answer that. He is the king of well know he had a resign his kingdom ATC. Allen Leverett : Yes, my assumptions would be Paul that since we will not have effective control of ATC even though we will have 60% economic interest. Since we will not have effective control because of the voting arrangement that we proposed, that we would still follow the equity method of accounting. So over in the asset set, you would have a statement already interest but I guess it's a majority interest in this case but you have a minority interest so you show you equity investment and you just take the earnings down. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: What's the board composition? Gale E. Klappa: The board composition of ATC or the combined company? Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: ATC. Allen L. Leverett: Well I guess when you say the composition let me back up and maybe just quickly go through the voting arrangement that we proposed. So what we proposed Paul is that the new combined company so this would be WEC Energy Group, WEC Energy Group would vote without limitation the 34% that Integrys Energy Group currently holds and then it would vote the remaining 26%, so that\u2019s the 26% the Wisconsin Energy holds now they would vote that in proportion to held the other shareholders vote. So in other words, Paul, we would be essentially in the same position that Integrys is today in terms of control, so that\u2019s how control would work and then you would vote for directors just like you vote for directors now and we will lead the position the same way as Integrys. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: I think you went over this on the call when you announced the deal (inaudible) okay, thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa: You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Bischof with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa: How are you Andy? Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Good. How are you? Any new share repurchase in the quarter before you announce the Integrys acquisition and cancellation buyback program? Gale E. Klappa: So there were nothing \u2013 there were no share repurchases in Q2. Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay and Gale if I could ask your overall thoughts on the EPA\u2019s green power plant announcement in June (inaudible) Wisconsin Energy and your overall discussions with the state regulators so far? Gale E. Klappa: Right, be happy to. Just to refresh everybody's memory, the environmental protection agency issued its proposed rule for CO2 reductions in essence from existing sources. And I believe the comment period now runs until October 16 of this year. Wisconsin's target and as you recall, each of the contiguous 48 states have been given separate CO2 reduction targets. And those targets were designed individually for each state by the staff of the EPA. Wisconsin\u2019s target 34% reduction. Nationwide, the reduction target is 30% so we are just slightly above the national average. I think for many of us, while I will give the EPA very, very strong marks for creativity I mean they have never tried to tackle problem with this type of an approach before and they have really tried to give the individual states flexibility. But I don't personally feel like we were given credit for taking early action. I mean we have invested $9 billion in energy infrastructure since 2003 much of that has been either in modern and efficient generating units, renewables energy efficiency, other approaches that can and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions. So if you look on our system, our green house gas emissions for the Wisconsin Energy are actually below the levels they were in 2000 and we just don't feel like we have been given credit for the early action and I think that's the standard view among of my counterparts in the industry. So we are going to be commenting on several things as we work our way through the comment period here one of which is we simply don't feel like the appropriate credit has been given for the early action and for the renewables that we have put in place, there is still lack of clarity which EPA admits around how they will treat biomass plants and of course in terms of emissions and of course we have almost $270 million investment we have just completed in our biomass plant that does meets the state's renewable portfolio standards. And then one of the building blocks that the EPA has pointed out in terms of how states can try to flexibly meet the new target is to really run the combined cycle of natural gas fired power plants in the country up to 70% capacity factor. That is difficult in many parts not just Wisconsin but in many parts of the country, the natural gas infrastructure to achieve that kind of capacity factor for natural gas units is just not there. It's just not in place. So we think there are a number of comments that we want to make. Overall though I still feel like we are quite well positioned as a company and the reason I think we are well positioned as the company is because of how efficient our new units are. Our units at Oak Creek which burn coal as you know, are among the top ten most efficient best log units in the country and one of the cleanest burning power plants literally in the world and our new natural gas unit at Port Washington, our new combined cycle units at Port Washington are the most efficient natural gas units in the Midwest. So given the fact that they emit less ounce per CO2 or less ounce of CO2 per unit of output, I still think we are well positioned as anyone. I hope that helps. Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Excellent detail. I very much appreciate it. Gale E. Klappa: You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Hey Gale. Question for you little bit about natural gas demand. What do you think over the last year's weather normalize natural gas demand has been in Wisconsin and what do you think if anything the new normal maybe? Gale E. Klappa: Okay. Well, levelized natural gas demand I would think it has gone up, it has got about 1% over the \u2013 Allen Leverett : It\u2019s about 0.5% to 1%. Gale E. Klappa: About 0.5% to 1% what we have seen on weather normal basis. Where is it going? I am still in the camp but there is potential for it to go up however. In the last two years, we have had as I mentioned earlier some of the most abnormal weather both warm and cold that really stresses the weather normalization techniques that the industry applies number one. So that's one thing that I think the jury is still out on. We need some more time to be able to determine whether a pattern of growth is stronger than we project. The other piece though is we are continuing to see in our state at any rate, a much quicker conversion of customers from propane to natural gas. You saw the statistics, or heard the statistics from our prepared script but I think we have got in terms of percentage of new customer connections for natural gas this year versus last year, we are up about 8.5%. So there are a number of competing factors here and moving pieces. I think it's still too early to tell whether or not we are in a stronger uptake patterns in terms of weather normalize natural gas consumption at retail. Again in states there are heavy propane users and Wisconsin I believe is the fifth heaviest state in the country in terms of propane use. We see some real potential opportunity. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Second, where does Illinois fall in that kind of realm when you think about potential for conversions and about local gas utility natural gas-related demand? Finally, and I'll knock them all out at once, of the $14 million in lower year-over-year O&M expense, how sustainable is that I mean when we look out to \u201915, \u201916 or \u201917, kind of multi-year out, is that a, hey, we're resetting the bar here to live within some of the regulatory kind of pieces of the regulatory agreement versus this is kind of a one-off? Gale E. Klappa: Alright. Good question again Michael. Let me tackle your Illinois question first. I don't see much in terms of propane conversion opportunity in the Integrys Group companies in Illinois because it's really people's gas so that is downtown and city of Chicago and then north shore which again very-very close to city itself. So I don't see the kinds of propane conversion opportunities in Illinois that we are seeing in Wisconsin and I hope that answers that question. And then I would also add in terms of the regulatory construction in Illinois for people's gas they are in a decoupled situation where we are not in Wisconsin. So, two different animals there and then in terms of O&M, in essence what a large chunk of and yes there are some sustainable productivity in cost reduction gains that we saw in the first half and that I think it will be permanent. But the line of share of $14 million of O&M cost reductions really came from lower medical and employee benefit expense and the reason for the medical we believe is that all of our employees switched as of January 1 of this year to high deductible plan. So the comparison maybe a little skewed in terms of medical costs, in terms of timing of when the company gets the medical cost flowing through. So we will see we will have a lot better picture in terms of medical cost and other employment costs, benefit costs, over the course of this year. The pattern maybe a little different this year and I suspect that it will be. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Meaning you think that O&M cost could be more backend loaded versus frontend loaded during the course of the year or I am not sure I totally follow you there. Gale E. Klappa: Sorry. The answer to your question is yes, particularly as it relates to medical. And here is why, I think for an individual we have $2500 deductible and for a family I think it's $5,000. So that was not in place with our low-deductible plans last year. So we suspect that our medical expenses will be back end loaded this year compared to last year and so yes the answer is there maybe some additional medical O&M expenses coming through in Q3 and Q4. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Okay. Thanks Gale. I appreciate it. Gale E. Klappa: You are more than welcome. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Brian Russo with Ladenburg. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa: Good afternoon Brian. Brian Russo - Ladenburg: Good afternoon. Just curious, most of my questions were asked and answered but what were the drivers enabling your guys to beat your second quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.52? Gale E. Klappa: Well there are three drivers that I would point out and Pat and Scott can certainly add to that if they would like. The first we have talked about earlier which was O&M reduction. That's worth about excluding the merger cost, that's worth about $0.04 a share compared to last year. Then we have talked about the biomass tax credits and because of the accounting rules, there was a $0.03 of share hit in Q2 a year ago versus no hit in this year's second quarter. And then we had a lower effective tax rate which helped us by about a penny. On the negative side, there was a penny of merger cost and a penny of weather. So if you strip all that out, essentially those were the answers. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg: Right. There was O&M reduction ahead of your expectations I am asking because you have guided to $0.50 to $0.52 in the second quarter but you reported $0.58 so there is something exceeded your original expectations. Gale E. Klappa: Yes absolutely. Pat, go right ahead. James Patrick Keyes : So yes Brian, sorry. Some of the O&M we didn\u2019t expect. So medical was a little better than we thought. I talked about timing differences hurting us in Q3 in the guidance we actually got little help in Q2 versus what we have planned. I am going to write it off \u2013 start it with there is no one big answer, it's lots of cats and dogs I gave you two, here is a couple more. Gas sales came in a little better than what we had forecast probably because it was colder in the first half in the quarter and then the other income I talked about the land sells in the west park was something we didn\u2019t anticipate either. So lots of little things kind of added up to give us better than guidance. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg: Got it. Thank you very much. James Patrick Keyes : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa: How are you Tim? Tim Winter - Gabelli & Co.: Good afternoon Gale. I just have a strategic question on ATC, so (inaudible) are the new hot thing and it looks like wind stream just got IRS approval to classify their transmission assets as real estate investment trust. Could you or is there any benefit that you guys have putting ATC in a retype structure? Allen L. Leverett: Tim this is Allen I guess at this point and of course we are certainly open to things that would provide value for our shareholders. So if we found later that it was advantageous to put something in a different structure or some other which certainly be open. However, I think one big issue that we would have to face if I understand the restructure correctly; there is a requirement to payout I think more than 90% of your earnings in dividends well we have a company like ATC which has got a very-very healthy amount of growth in investments. If that company would have to payout say 90%+ in dividends they are going have to be very regularly in a position where they have to raise equity and I am not sure that that would be a good thing necessarily, a good position to be in. So that would a concern that I would have. A second concern is how exactly would the provision for income taxes for that company be treated in FERC rate making. And so one of the benefits which you get with the REIT as you only have a single level of taxation, right? Well, I am not sure how you keep that benefit relative to our current structure if you have to give all that provision for income tax benefit back the customers. So at a high levels those would be the two concerns that I would have about the REIT structure but again Tim, you know if it ended up but at some point that was adventurous and certainly be very open to another structure, hopefully that make sense. Tim Winter - Gabelli & Co.: Yes it does, thank you. Allen L. Leverett: You are welcome, Tim. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Gale? Gale E. Klappa: Hi Julian, how are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Dandy. Gale E. Klappa: Glad to hear that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Excellent. So let me cut back to that last question little bit and ask a little bit of a different ways. So there is the cost to capital is getting a bit competitively, how are you all feeling in your ability to compete for those planned acquisitions in the state and specifically I\u2019d be curious do you feel like you have any incumbent advantage as being in the state synergies or otherwise that would allow you to kind of outcompete anyone else who might be looking at those assets? Allen Leverett : So your question is about the state power plant, it\u2019s not about ATC? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Indeed. Gale E. Klappa: My guess is that minor movements in the cost of capital are not going to be a major impediment or a major benefit one way or the another. If the state does move forward with the selling the state owned steam and generating plants, I think they are going to be looking obviously for us competitive prices they can get but they are also going to be looking for the type of experience that I think we bring to the table. Again, these plants are providing pretty essential services to places like state owned hospitals to places like all the state capital, all the major universities and the system in Wisconsin and so I think there are going to be other factors, other than just pure price that will play into the winning bidder if the process does go forward. So experience and a track record are being able to operate these types of plants to improve the operations of the plants and to add environmental upgrade on time and on budget, I am confident it would a factor here. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Excellent and then another high level conversation, coal rail deliveries continuing to hear commentary from other folks, where do you guys stand on that, anything to add to the mix? Gale E. Klappa: Yes, we will let Allan talk about how tight things are right now. Allen Leverett : Yes, most of our deliveries are from the Union Pacific although we do have a percentage wise a small amount from the Burlington Northern and a small amount from the Norfolk southern and we have had a lot of challenges really with all the railroads this year but particularly with the Burlington Northern. Some of that stuff is in their control, a lot of it is out of their control for example they had a lot of flooding of some the lines earlier this year but from inventory standpoint our coal inventories are pretty tight right now. We are not up to the levels that we would like them to be and we are not yet on the path to getting the levels that we want to be at in late September. So we certainly have and had to curtail operations of our plants. You may have seen some, in fact there was a news article this morning that a utility in Wisconsin is saying that they might actually have to shut down one of their coal plants because of the bad inventory situation. So it certainly not a level that would calls curtailment but it\u2019s something that I am focusing very much on with our group in terms of coal deliveries and it\u2019s something we would be happy to give you another update on when we have our call in October. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Excellent. Just cutting back to ATC, specifically, I'd be curious, any comments of late on both the competitive FERC process, there've been some tweaks in MISO. Do you feel better about the FERC 1000 process and then separately any commentary of late on the New England case as it relates to ATC? Allen Leverett : I guess no change really on our view of the competitive. This is the order of 1,000 process I mean of course within our traditional footprint within Wisconsin and the UP of Michigan we still have right of first refusal on non-multi value project. So that\u2019s still there, we feel good about that and we feel good about our ability to compete for multi-value projects. But not a lot to add really on the process out east with the FERC ROE review, you know Julian the range of numbers that we had heard thrown out at the FERC low end was 10.57 return high end I believe it was 11 and three quarters and that compares to a current 12.2 at ATC so on a worse case basis, if ATC were taken all the way down to 10.57 that would be about a $0.04 per share impact on the combined company. So if you looked at the WEC Energy Group with the 60% ownership and ATC that would be about $0.04 impact at the low end, at the higher end 11 and three quarters it would be $0.01 a share. So still relatively nominal impacts but it\u2019s something will \u2013 it\u2019s not decided at this point and certainly. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Presumably you go back and get riders on top of that? Gale E. Klappa: Well that\u2019s uncertain. You are talking about incentives? Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Yes, sorry incentives. Gale E. Klappa: I don\u2019t believe so. Allen Leverett : Well ATC has not gotten the incentive adder but they have gotten things like a full quip in rate base approach. So we traditionally have not gotten the \u2013 I will call it the incentive ROC which is one of the reasons why I think, we at least have shot that maintaining the 12 because we were never getting the incentive level. Gale E. Klappa: And never asking for them really. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Right, absolutely. Great, well thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa: Thank you very much. Well, ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. Colleen Henderson will be available at our Investor Relations office, and her direct line is (414) 221-2592. Thanks, again, everybody. Take care.",

Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation. Gale Klappa : Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us, as we review our 2014 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.60 for last year's third quarter. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Group. The headline for this quarter, of course, was our cool summer weather. So you maybe wondering how cool was it? Well, three numbers best describe the summer temperatures in our region, 19, 65, and zero. In the third quarter, we had 19 days, when the high temperature for the day never reached 70 degrees. There were 65 days, when the high temperature never reached 80 degrees. And finally, we had zero 90 degree days in Milwaukee this summer. But even with the sharply lower customer demand for air conditioning, we continued to deliver solid results. Our focus on financial discipline and industry-leading reliability continued to serve us well. Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.5% in September and remains well below the national average. In fact, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since 2008. And as the economy has continued to improve over the course of the year, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers have also edged higher. For the first three quarters of the year, our large customers excluding the iron ore mines, consumed 1.3% more electricity than during the corresponding nine months a year ago. And if you look at the data on a weather -normalized basis, total retail sales of electricity have grown by 2.1% during the first nine moths of 2014. We're seeing recent strength in four sectors of the economy; paper manufacturing, food products, rubber and plastics production, and metal fabricating. In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are up by 4.8% and new natural gas installations are up by actually more than 20% compared with the same period last year. Later in my remarks, I'll update you on several positive developments in our core business as well as the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress on obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combining the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise, scale, and the financial resources to meet the region's future energy needs. We'll serve nearly 4.4 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. In fact, the combination will create the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America, and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be invested prudently in new and upgraded energy infrastructure. Now, as you're well aware, we have consistently used three criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity. First, we would have to believe that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would need to be largely credit neutral. And finally, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. I am pleased to report that we believe this combination meets or exceeds all three criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either one of us projecting on a standalone basis. And importantly, more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses. Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity. And over time, we'll enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices systemwide. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys today is one of the major owners of American Transmission Company, with a 34.1% interest. Wisconsin Energy is the second largest owner with a 26.2% interest. The combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest transmission companies of the country. ATC, if you haven't noticed, has a new 10-year capital investment plan that was just rolled out. In that 10-year plan, ATC plans to bolster electric reliability across our region. ATC's capital plan for the years 2014 to 2023 calls for investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. We believe it's a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. Moving on to our dividend policy. Just a reminder, in the period before closing, Wisconsin Energy plans to continue its current dividend policy, which calls for a 7% to 8% annual increase in the dividend. At closing, we would expect a further dividend increase of 7% to 8% for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. Then going forward, the projected payout target for the combined company will be 65% to 70% of earnings. Now, as you know, the transaction is subject to approvals from the shareholders of both companies and from several regulatory agencies. These agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Public Service Commissions of Wisconsin and Michigan, The Illinois Commerce Commission, and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The transaction also is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. We filed with all four state utility commissions on August 6, and we're currently working through the respective proceedings. In Wisconsin, the Commission has set a schedule for the case with a vote expected to take place no later than March 20, 2015. In Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff has proposed a schedule that calls for an ICC decision on July 6, 2015. In Michigan, a revised schedule calls for a decision by the Michigan Commission in June of 2015. And in Minnesota, the State Attorney General has recommended that the Minnesota Commission open a docket to review the transaction, and the Minnesota's Department of Commerce has requested additional information before the end of this month. In addition, we filed our application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on August 15. The public comment period at FERC closed on October 17, and we filed our response to those comments yesterday. We also filed our Hart-Scott-Rodino application on September 24. I'm very pleased to report that the Department of Justice closed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on October 24 with no further action required by the company. This clears the way for the acquisition under federal antitrust rules. In other developments, the Securities and Exchange Commission has declared our registration statement effective. And as a result, we scheduled our special shareholder meeting for November 21. Integrys has also scheduled to hold its shareholder meeting the same day. We're making really good progress on all the regulatory fronts, and we anticipate closing the transaction during the second half of 2015. And one more item related to Integrys, back in June, Integrys announced the sale of its unregulated power and natural gas marketing business to Exelon. Exelon will pay $60 million for the Integrys\u2019 retail operations, plus adjusted networking capital at the time of closing. On October 14, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and Integrys expects now to complete the sale and have the closing by the end of this year. To summarize, we believe our acquisition of Integrys will create the premiere regulated utility system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come. The benefits to all of our stakeholders from the customers and communities we serve, to the people we employ to the shareholders who count on us to create value, are clear, compelling and achievable. And now turning back to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, in mid-July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission, approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral in the west central Wisconsin. The 85 miles of pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County, in the far western part of the state, to the city of Tomah in west central Wisconsin. The project will address reliability concerns of that region and meet growing demand. Demand of course has been driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in western Wisconsin. The Commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route, and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. In mid-August, we received a permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, approving with minimal modification our mitigation plan for wetlands and waterways. And on October 7, we began work on portions of the downstream facilities, with construction of the larger diameter lateral scheduled to begin early next year. We expect to complete this project in the fourth quarter of 2015, and our projected cost is between $175 million and $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley power plant from coal to natural gas. As a reminder, the two unit Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center, and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. We're on time and on budget with this gas conversion project. And a major milestone for the project, we achieved first fire on natural gas in Unit 1 at Valley on October 2. However, tuning is now nearly complete and the unit will be available and fueled by natural gas for the first time for the winter heating season. Unit 2 at Valley is now scheduled to be converted to natural gas next year. We expect the total conversion cost to be $65 million to $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. And you may also recall that in March of last year, we began a major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the Valley facility. This $30 million pipeline replacement project was completed on time and on budget in August. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating cost for the units and enhance the environmental performance. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at about 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. Next, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Twin Falls was built back in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the boarder of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Construction is underway now to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity that meets current federal standards. Since our last update, we've made really good progress on the major construction work at Twin Falls. The upstream cofferdam has been completed and rock excavation is well underway with completion expected later this year. We plan to begin construction of the new powerhouse itself in the spring, and we're still slated to complete the project in the summer of 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, excluding allowance for funds used during constructions. We're also making excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at the new Oak Creek expansion units. As you'll recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending on the fuel mix. Last year we received environmental approvals, began making changes to the boilers and testing a blend of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. This summer we took the next step, we filed a request with the Commission in Wisconsin to approve additional capital spending for modifications of the plant. Our share of that investment will be $21 million. If approved, these modifications will support operations of up to 60% PRB blend and testing of up to a 100% PRB blend. So with the older coal units at Oak Creek already burning PRB and the newer units burning more PRB, we clearly need to have the space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory on-site. As a result, we filed a request just a few days ago with the Wisconsin Commission for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our estimated capital cost for this part of the project is $58 million. In summary, we see significant investment opportunities in our core business, including our focus on delivering the future, as we also continue to work on our aging distribution networks. Our capital budget, as you may recall, estimates spending of $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the five-year period, 2014 through 2018. And over the 10-year period, from 2014 through 2023, we expect to invest between $6.5 billion and $7.1 billion. We'll keep you posted, as our effort to upgrade the region's energy infrastructure moves on. And finally, turning to Wisconsin rate matters. In May we reached a settlement facilitated by the Wisconsin Commission staff with three major customer groups. The settlement covers return on equity, capital structure and base rate changes for the forward looking test years 2015 and 2016. If approved by the Commission, Wisconsin Electric will have a return on equity going forward of 10.2% with no change in its capital structure. And Wisconsin Gas will have a return on equity of 10.3% with a higher equity component in its capital structure. The equity component for Wisconsin Gas would increase from 47.5% to 49.5%. Based on this settlement non-fuel electric rates would increase by 1.4%, beginning in 2015. The remainder of the rate case has been focused on rate design and fuel cost recovery for 2015. Hearings were held by the Commission in September and October here in the state, and a decision from the Commission is expected before the end of the year with new rates to take effect on January 1. With that, I'll turn things over to our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes, for more details on our third quarter results. Pat? Patrick Keyes : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.57 a share compared to $0.60 a share for the same quarter in 2013. Our GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.56 a share, which includes cost associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter was $246.1 million as compared to $258 million in 2013. That's a decline of $11.9 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the third quarter of 2014 totaled $158.4 million, a decrease of $8.2 million from the third quarter of 2013. As Gale mentioned, the cool wet summer reduced our cooling mode, and as a result our margins were $28.6 million lower than last year. The cool weather also had an impact on our fuel recoveries, because hourly prices for opportunity sales in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator market were lower, we had fewer dollars to flow back through the fuel cost recovery role. Therefore on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our fuel recoveries were down by $16.5 million. On the positive side, our utility operating and maintenance cost were $22 million lower than the same period last year, reflecting lower benefits cost and effective cost controls. Our earnings were also helped by $15.9 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant. Combining these and other factors results in the $8.2 million decrease in utility operating income in the third quarter of 2014 as compared with the same quarter in the prior year. Operating income in our Non-Utility segment was essentially level on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which is in line with our expectations. Our corporate and other segment had a $4.1 million reduction in income, virtually all of which related to the acquisition of Integrys. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the $11.9 million decrease in operating income. Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $18 million in the third quarter, which is up about $900,000 for the same period in 2013. Our other income net declined by $2.2 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased largely, because our biomass plant was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, our net interest expense declined by $1.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates and lower debt levels. When compared to the third quarter of 2013, our tax expense in down slightly. However, we have a slightly higher effective tax rate due in part to the inability to deduct certain cost related to the acquisition. We expect our effective tax rate for 2014 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $126.3 million of reported net income for the third quarter of 2014 or earnings of $0.56 per share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude $0.01 of acquisition cost, were $0.57 per share. For the first nine months of 2014, our adjusted earning per share were $2.08 as compared to $1.88 for the first nine months of 2013. Year-to-date adjusted net income in 2014 was $474.2 million, up from $433.1 million in the corresponding period a year ago. Our adjusted operating cash flows during the first nine months of 2014 totaled $1,035 million, which is a $16 million decrease from the same period in 2013. Consistent with prior quarters, we saw stronger operating cash flows, because of higher net income and larger non-cash charges related to depreciation and deferred income taxes. On the other hand, we experienced an increase in cash needs for working capital, including natural gas and storage. Our total capital expenditures increased by $50 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to 2013, primarily because of investments in our distribution infrastructure. We paid $264 million in common dividends in the first nine months of 2014, an increase of $22 million or almost 9% compared to the first nine months of 2013. And I am pleased to report that our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.9% at the end of September. That's the lowest level we've seen since the year 2000. With our announcement of the acquisition of Integrys, we suspended our share repurchase program, and thereby enhanced our cash position. A reminder, that our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401k plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares for these plans. Year-to-date retail deliveries of electricity rose by 1.1% as compared to the same period in 2013. Our normalized year-to-date retail deliveries were up 2.1%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential deliveries decline by 2.1%. But on a normalized basis, residential usage rose by 0.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, we saw year-to-date deliveries up 0.1%, and on a normalized basis they were also up 0.1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, on a normalized basis, year-to-date deliveries were up by 5.2%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, we were up 1.7%. Overall, these results are in line with our expectations. Year-to-date retail natural gas sales were up 13.1% compared to the same period in 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 2.6%. The results from our natural gas delivery business are ahead of our expectations for the year. Finally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are tightening our annual earnings guidance. Our prior guidance was $2.58 to $2.64 a share. Our new guidance is $2.60 to $2.64 a share. Again, our new guidance for 2014 is $2.60 to $2.64 a share. This guidance excludes an estimated $0.05 per share of legal, professional and banking fees associated with the acquisition of Integrys. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with UBS. Mike Weinstein - UBS: A quick question about the election coming up, and the sale of state assets that potentially might happen one day in the future, has this become an election issue at all? People have been using it as a hammer or a nail, any sense? Gale Klappa : No, not at all, Mike. Good question. Really the entire election has turned on jobs. And on the Governor's track record in terms of job creation and elimination of budget deficits, et cetera, so there has been actually, I haven't heard a single word in any of the campaign material or any of the debates about the potential sale of state-owned power plants, nothing. Mike Weinstein - UBS: And in terms of the O&M savings this quarter, is a lot of that considered ongoing and will flow-through into the fourth quarter as well? Gale Klappa : Well, I'll let Pat give his view as well. When you look at the O&M savings quarter-on-quarter, there were two or three things that really stand out. First of all, we had some very positive results from pension expense and healthcare costs. On healthcare costs, this is the first year, you may have heard us mention this before, this is the first year that all of our employees have moved to a high deductible healthcare plan. So we'll see, but we may see some rebound in healthcare expenses in Q4. On pension cost, I think Pat's view is for 2014, that should be a pretty well a permanent-type savings. Then the third piece in terms of the better performance on O&M, the strong performance on O&M in the quarter, is we did see some operating cost savings from our maintenance on our distribution network, simply because our networks really weren't stressed, given the cool summer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : So I might have missed it. But I just wanted to see if you have any color on the issues that you are getting from the Michigan Governor and political people related to the merger transaction? They are filing at FERC and delay in schedule. I mean it seems like it relates to the Upper Peninsula issues. Could you just talk about potential solutions for that? Gale Klappa : I would be happy to, and thanks for asking, Steve. First of all, I think you've really nailed the principle concern. The principle concern from the Governor's office and the State Attorney General's office at Michigan really relates to the power supply problems and the energy future for the Upper Peninsula, and that is first and foremost on their minds. Right, that's point number one. Our point number two, it's becoming very, very clear, it's been clear for a while to us, but it's, I think becoming very clear to all the parties in Michigan that the customer choice law there is deeply flawed, particularly when it allows 90% customer choice in one area of the state and kept at 10% customer choice in the rest of the states. And of course, 90% customer choice in the UP makes long-term capacity planning very, very difficult. So that I think is emerging as a very significant issue. And then, thirdly, there has been a lot of very productive and positive discussion emerging with the lead of the Governor's office about what they call a global solution to the UP energy problems. Yesterday, as a matter of fact, there was a very well attempted Energy Summit hosted in Marquette, Michigan, about the UP issues. And the Governor's senior aide mentioned that she was very encouraged about the positive discussions going on among the parties, and hopeful that a solution could emerge in the near timeframe of the next 60 to 90 days. So we're very actively involved in those discussions. The only thing I really can add to that is that I think clearly the preference of the administration is building additional generation in the UP. And we have indicated we would be willing to be an investor, as part of that solution. Is that helpful, Steve? Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : And then on the Governor election, I mean, obviously don't know who's going to win. But in the event there were to be a change in Governor in Wisconsin, how does that impact the Commission at all? Do they -- I mean their terms are still for a while, right? Gale Klappa : Absolutely. In fact, really for the near-term and even in the medium-term, I would see really no change at the Commission. Chairman Montgomery, I believe has five years left on his six-year term; Commissioner Nowak has a very long period left on her six-year term; Commissioner Callisto, who is the prior Governor's appointee, his term expires in March of 2015. Of course, that seat would be appointed one way or another by the new Governor. But in terms of the two Governor Walker appointees on the Commission, they have very long periods left in their term. So I would really see no change in philosophy or approach of the Commission, regardless of which candidate wins. I will say everybody has been waiting with bated breath here for the latest poll. The polling firm that has been doing regular -- Marquette University, doing regular polling on the Governor's race and was actually the most accurate polling result from the Governor's recall race, a couple of years ago, literally just released the final poll before the election, about 15 minutes ago. And I'm told it shows Governor Walker up 50 to 43 among likely voters. So that would be a very big swing. It showed a tie just two weeks ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Just curious, what were the drivers or what enabled you to beat your initial third quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.52? Was it the lower O&M due to the less stressed network, or is there anything else going on? Gale Klappa : Probably three things going on. Certainly lower O&M due to less stress on the network was a factor. Truth of the matter is even though it's not a big gas quarter -- or not a big quarter for gas sales, our natural gas distribution sales came in better than expected, that was a help; medical expenses better than expected; and then September weather, while it was still cooler than normal was much closer to normal than July and August, and all those factors combined together to bring in numbers that were better than our own expectations. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : And then just remind us of where the state stands in their evaluation of the state-owned generation asset sale process? Gale Klappa : Really no significant update from what we provided to you in the past. Everybody has been focused on the election. And as I've mentioned before, if Governor Walker wins the election, I suspect there will be some movement by the state since they've already hired a financial advisor to advice them on state asset sales. I would expect you would see some movement in 2015, if Mary Burke, the Democratic candidate wins. We are really uncertain as to whether she would pursue any sale of state assets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : I wanted to follow-up on a few things. First of all, on the Michigan stuff. There was a letter, as you know, that was sent to FERC. And they seemed to indicate among other things; this is from the Michigan Governor and what have you, that they saw some sort of conflict between ATC and generation. And they seem to allude to the idea that if there was a generation solution there may not be as big a need for a transmission investment. Can you address that at all? If you guys were to invest in generation would that, do you think impact the CapEx for ATC or something like that? Gale Klappa : Well, let me frame it a little bit, then I'm going to ask Allen to give you his view as well, since Allen has been deeply involved in all of this, as have I. I think first, it's important to realize that the real concerns from the Michigan Governor's office and the Michigan Attorney General's office, the best we can tell and in our discussions with them, their real concerns are what I mentioned earlier. They are concerned about the future energy supply in the UP. It's a difficult situation up there as you know given customer choice, given the fact that the Presque Isle units need environmental control upgrades. And then there are lot of moving pieces, but I think that it's becoming clear that a very significant part of the longer term solution is new generation. And we have expressed a willingness to be an investor. Now clearly, if new generation is built that would mean less transmission will have be built; whether or not new generation alone would be sufficient to eliminate transmission upgrades, that's still to be decided. But clearly, an important part of the equation I think, Allen, is new generation. Allen Leverett : Yes. I think, Paul, I guess your question also goes to, if I understand it, with the magnitude of transmission required would be less if you had additional generation in the UP. And I think our view would be that, yes, if you had generation up there, you'd certainly need less in the way of transmission upgrades. But I would emphasize less as opposed to actually being able to eliminate the need for any transmission upgrades. So it's not something I could quantify for you today, but I would say you sort of have two options. One is a pure transmission solution, which we don't think is a good option. The other is really a generation solution coupled with a greatly reduced amount of transmission, but I don't see an option, Paul, where there is no additional transmission investment at all. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : And then just with respect to the potential investment in new generation up there, is that possible that that would be part of the Cliffs investigation they are doing with Invenergy for a combined heat plants or is that probably something separate? Gale Klappa : No. At the moment, there's lots of discussions going on and lot of ideas on the table, and a lot of cooperation among the parties and that's really about all I can tell you at this point. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : You mentioned 60 to 90 days being mentioned as it is wrapping it up, but do you think we might hear anything in the near-term or nearer-term regarding progress on this issue? Gale Klappa : My guess is, and I'm simply guessing, because again a number of parties are at the table, lot of discussions going on. My guess is the most definitive statements will come either yearend or shortly thereafter. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : And then finally, just a follow-up on Mike's question on the O&M and your answer about the high-deductible plan. You said that there might be a rebound in the fourth quarter. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that? Is that because people have spent their deductible or is something else going on? Gale Klappa : No. That's exactly it. We suspect that many people would have met their deductible by Q4. And therefore we might see slightly higher medical cost expenses in Q4 than when we were under a more traditional healthcare plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : One easy question for you. When you talk about the need for capacity in the UP, roughly how much in terms of megawatt capacity are we talking about? And are we simply just talking about gas-fired capacity replacing coal or is it conceivable there is a little more diversity in the fuel mix there? Gale Klappa : Well, let me answer the second question first and then we'll get Allen's view on the capacity, because a number of different configurations could emerge. So I'm not sure we can give you a precise number on capacity. I would think, based on all the discussions so far, that a principal solution will be natural gas fired capacity probably combined-cycle natural gas plant. However, there is also discussion about augmenting that with some renewables. Again, lots of discussion on the table right now, but I would think the primary thrust would involve new natural gas combined-cycle capacity. Allen? Allen Leverett : Yes. And I would say, Michael, in terms of amount of capacity, my view would be the amount of capacity required will be somewhere between 250 megawatts and 350 megawatts. But given the nature of the situation there, you'd have to configure that in a way, I mean for example, if there were combined-cycle, you'd probably want more than two trains, you'd probably want three trains, so that multiple CTs, multiple heat recovery steam generators, so that should be able to maintain them in a fashion that allows you to maintain the reliability in the UP. But my guess on range of capacity is in that 250 to 350 range. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : And Allen, as long as I've got you, any update in terms of the multi-value project analysis that the Midwest ISO goes through in terms of evaluating all significant potential new transmission projects in that RTO, not just ones dealing with the UP? Allen Leverett : No, not really. MISO continues with their current process. They have all the different appendices. I think they go from A to B, in terms of the way that they look at the projects and they evaluate the projects. So there is really no update, Michael, I'm sorry, that I could offer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Charles Fishman - Morningstar: Can I burden you with one more question on Michigan's comments concerning the merger? They were also, the Governor and AG were a little concerned about the ownership percentage that you'll have in ATC. And it made me think that are you also at risk by maintaining that higher a level of ownership or at least ATC at risk of losing their independence incentive ROE that they received from FERC? And could that be another potential driver that might, obviously, the simple solution is just to divest a small piece of ATC if you need to, but I'll leave it at that and let you comment. Gale Klappa : The short answer on independence is no; no danger. And I'll let Allen give you the details. Allen Leverett : Yes. But I guess on the independence point, Charles, at this point there is only one transmission company that FERC deems being capital I, independent, and that's ITC. So at this point they don't deem it to be independent anyway. So the fact that you have this merger is not going to change anything about that. But I do think, Charles, and I'm glad you asked a follow-up question, because I think a distinction here is very, very important. ATC is a member of MISO. And as such, they transfer control over their transmission facilities to MISO. So look, as a consequence, regardless of what entities are deemed to control ATC, ATC's transmission facilities are going to be under the control of MISO and nothing about the merger is going to change that fact. And the FERC has held on a number of occasions, at least three, that I am aware of that mergers of utilities that even own directly transmission facilities that are under the control of an RTO, don't raise any vertical market power concerns. : Charles Fishman - Morningstar: Well, that sounds like a good response, and I assume that will be in your rebuttal testimony. Gale Klappa : It already is. Charles Fishman - Morningstar: Was about already, the rebuttal on that? Gale Klappa : It's filed yesterday. Allen Leverett : Yes. Our answer, it was filed yesterday, Charles. Charles Fishman - Morningstar: I didn't read it yet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: It sounds as though, even if you participate in the UP generation solution, it's not going to change your comments around equity needs. Gale Klappa : No, it will not change our comments on our equity needs. You are absolutely correct. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And then one of the reasons you gave for your beat was that you had normal weather in September? Gale Klappa : We had closer to normal weather in September. July and August were 18 standard deviations off the norm, and I am only slightly exaggerating. But we had basically assumed in our guidance, we would have an abnormally cool summer for all three months of the quarter. July and August certainly met our expectations for coolness. September, while below normal, was closer to normal. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: So you extrapolated July across the entire quarter? Gale Klappa : Well, actually extrapolated June across the entire quarter. Gale Klappa : All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you again for participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office. And that direct line is 414-221-2592. Thanks, again, everyone.",

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy\u2019s conference call to review 2014 year-end results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, the referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today. And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation. Gale Klappa : Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. This compares with earnings of $2.51 a share for 2013. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.06 a share related to our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Group. I'm very pleased to report to you that 2014 was another exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. We delivered record financial results, we were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fourth year in a row, extending our strong track record of network reliability and customer satisfaction. We invested nearly $740 million in our core business with all major projects on time and on budget. We achieved the safest year of operation in the history of the company, which dates back more than 100 years. And we announced the acquisition of Integrys Energy. We believe that the combination of our two companies will create the premier regulated utilities system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come. The benefits to all of our stakeholders are clear, compelling, and achievable. Turning now to the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.2% at the end of 2014, well below the national average, and the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008. As the economy continued to improve over the course of the year, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers began to strengthen as well. On weather nominal basis for the year, our large customers excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 1.3% more electricity than they did in 2013. We also saw steady improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including paper manufacturing, food products, primary metals and rubber and plastics production. In addition, we continued to see an uptick in customer growth across our system, particularly in our natural gas distribution business. For example, new electric service connections were up by 5.7% for the year, but new natural gas installations rose by more than 28% during 2014. Later in my remarks, I'll update you on several developments in our core business as well as the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23, 2014, we announced our plan to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combining the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise, scale, and the financial resources to meet the region's future energy needs. We'll serve more than 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. In fact, the combination will create the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America, and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be invested prudently in new and upgraded energy infrastructure for the region. Now, as you're well aware, we have consistently used three criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity. First, we would have to believe that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would need to be largely credit neutral. And finally, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. Our analysis continues to show that the combination meets or exceeds all three criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either one of us projecting on a standalone basis. And importantly, more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses. Our customers will clearly benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity. And over time, we'll enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our Energy Group by incorporating best practices system wide. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys today is one of the major owners of American Transmission Company, with a 34.1% interest. Wisconsin Energy is the second largest owner with a 26.2% interest. That means, the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest transmission companies of the country. ATC, of course, has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region. In fact, ATC\u2019s capital plan for the years 2014 to 2023 calls for investment of between $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. So where do we stand in gaining the necessary approvals? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders back on November 21, 2014. In addition, the US Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on October 24, 2014 with no further action required by the company. As you know, the transaction also requires the approval of several regulatory agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Wisconsin and Michigan Public Service Commissions, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We filed with all four state utility commissions in early August and we are currently working through each of the proceedings. Perhaps the most notable regulatory development has occurred in Michigan, where we reached a settlement last month that helps to pave the way for the acquisition, while addressing electric reliability concerns in the Upper Peninsula. I'll talk about the settlement in more detail in just a moment. But it's important to note that the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, and the iron ore mines all sent letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January stating that they have no objections to our transaction. These parties will not oppose, will not condition or delay the confirmation of the transaction in any proceeding at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the state Attorney General and the Michigan Commission staff and the mines will not seek or support any other conditions to the merger and proceedings at the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Michigan Commission has set a schedule now that calls for a decision by June 15 of this year. In Wisconsin, the Commission expects to vote on the acquisition no later than April 16. In Illinois, the Commerce Commission staff has proposed a schedule that calls for a decision two days after July 4, on July 6, 2015. And the Minnesota Commission is expected to review our application in early May. Finally, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, public comment periods in our merger case have now closed and we continue to work diligently to gain FERC approval. In summary, we're making very good progress on all the regulatory fronts and we still anticipate closing the transaction during the second half of 2015. Two final items related to our acquisition of Integrys. Back in June, Integrys announced the sale of its unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. That sale was completed on November 3, 2014 to a subsidiary of Exelon. The other item relates to the Michigan settlement that I discussed earlier. The settlement calls for the sale of the electric distribution assets owned by both Wisconsin Energy and Integrys in the Upper Peninsula, as well as the sale of our Presque power plant to Upper Peninsula Power Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Wisconsin Energy's distribution assets would be sold for an amount slightly higher than book value. Subject to state regulatory approval, we intend to return that premium overbooked value to our customers. The Presque Isle plant would be sold for $1 reflecting the current market value of the facility. As you may recall, we attempted to sell Presque Isle last year, but we did not receive any valid offers. We expect to treat the plant sale as an asset retirement and we will seek recovery of the approximately $200 million of net unrecovered plant balance consistent with prior regulatory practice. Customers in both Wisconsin and Michigan will clearly benefit from this agreement. Once the Presque Isle plant is sold, Wisconsin customers will no longer have to pay for the operating costs associated with the plant, our Michigan customers will also avoid short-term costs. And Michigan's Upper Peninsula will have more control over its energy future as it will no longer be part of a single Wisconsin/Michigan system. In the end, this agreement addresses the needs of all the parties in the settlement and clears the way for Michigan State regulatory approval of our proposed acquisition. And now turning to recent developments in our core business, as you may recall, last July we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new major natural gas lateral in west central Wisconsin. The 85 miles of pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County, in the far western part of the state, to the city of Tomah in west central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns of that region and will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that part of the state. The Commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route, and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. In October, we began work on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the three branch lines were installed as of mid-November. Construction on the third branch began in January and of course we have one major large diameter lateral to install. Route clearing for that lateral also began early this year. We expect to complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million and $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley power plant from coal to natural gas. The two-unit Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center, and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I\u2019m pleased to report that the project remains on schedule and on budget. Unit 1 achieved commercial operation burning natural gas back in November. The entire Valley plant is available to operate at full power at this time with Unit 1 burning natural gas and Unit 2 continuing to burn coal. And we expect Unit 2 to be converted to natural gas in time for next winter seeding season. Overall, the project is currently about 66% complete, we expect the total conversion cost to be between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Twin Falls was built in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the boarder of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The construction now underway to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We continue to make good progress on the major construction work at Twin Falls. The upstream cofferdam has been completed and rock excavation is well underway. Overall the project, as we speak today, is approximately 37% complete. We plan to begin construction of the new powerhouse this spring and we expect commercial operation in the new powerhouse to begin in the summer of 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, excluding funds used during construction. Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the cost differential now between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending on the blend. In 2013, we received the necessary environmental approvals, began making changes to the boilers and started testing various blend of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. With a few modifications, both units can sustain a 20% PRB blend. We\u2019ve also conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at various levels up to 100% PRB. Although testing has gone well, there are operational issues that need to be resolved and equipment that must be modified to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. So in July of last year, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending for modifications of the plant. Our share of that investment would be approximately $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends up to 100% PRB. Also it\u2019s very clear that we need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory at the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission in October of last year for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our estimated capital cost for this particular project is $58 million. We hope to receive Commission approvals for both of these projects in the second half of this year. Looking forward, we see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business, as we also continue to upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our updated capital budget, and this is new information, our updated capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion over the five-year period, 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10-year capital budget now calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. Turning now to our dividend policy, at its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised our quarterly dividend to $0.4225 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the dividend paid during 2014. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.69 a share. The Board also reaffirmed our standalone dividend policy that targets at a payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend again by 7% to 8% for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. And then going forward, a project that payout target for the combined company is expected to be between 65% to 70% of earnings. And finally turning to Wisconsin rate matters, in December the Wisconsin Commission issued its final order on our re-filings for the years 2015 and 2016. The order approved a net bill increase of 0.10% related to the non-fuel costs for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin. The new rates went into effect and January 1. The order also approved an increase in the fixed portion of our customer\u2019s monthly bills, while correspondingly reducing the kilowatt hour charge. As you know, a higher fixed charge and a lower energy charge more accurately reflect our cost structure. Lastly, the Commission approved a return on equity of 10.2% for Wisconsin Electric and 10.3% for Wisconsin Gas. It also authorized an increase in the Wisconsin Gas common equity component to an average of 49.5%, up from 47.5%. The midpoint of Wisconsin Electric\u2019s equity component remains unchanged at 51%. In summary, ladies and gentlemen, 2014 was another year of achievement for Wisconsin Energy, the company continues to perform at a high level both financially and operationally. And our proposed acquisition of Integrys positions as well for strong future growth as we focus on delivering the future. And now with more details on our full-year performance and our outlook for 2015, here\u2019s our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat? Patrick Keyes : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2014 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our two business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense, and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2014 was $1.112 billion as compared with $1.080 billion in 2013. That's an increase of $32 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, operating income in 2014 totaled $770.2 million, an increase of $50.8 million over 2013. On the positive side, lower O&M spending, in part driven by lower benefits costs, increased our margins by $59.3 million. We also had a $28 million increase in revenues due to the second year of our Wisconsin rate order. On the negative side, depreciation expense increased by $20.4 million in 2014, primarily because our biomass plant was placed into service late in 2013. We estimate that weather resulted in a net $14.8 million decline. While we experienced cold winter weather in 2014, this was more than offset by our cool summer. Now, turning to our non-utility segment, operating income was up $1.1 million when compared to last year. This increase reflects new investments at our power the future plants. Our corporate and others segment showed an operating loss of $26.3 million, which is almost $20 million more than the prior year. During 2014, we incurred $14.6 million of external costs, primarily legal, banking and professional fees related to the Integrys acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at a $32 million increase in operating income, or a $46.6 million increase adjusted for the $14.6 million of acquisition costs. During 2014, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled nearly $66 million, which is $2.5 million decline from 2013. Our other income net declined by $5.4 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased because we completed the biomass facility in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our net interest expense declined by $10.6 million. This was primarily driven by lower long-term interest costs as our net debt issuances are at rates lower than the rates on scheduled maturities. Our consolidated income tax expense rose by $23.8 million because of higher pre-tax earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was 38.1%, as compared to 36.9% in 2013. We estimate that our standalone effective tax rate in 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $588.3 million of net income or GAAP earnings of $2.59 a share for the year. Adding back $0.06 per share for the after-tax impact of acquisition costs, we saw adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share. During 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $1.198 billion, which is a $33 million decrease from 2013. We experienced higher net income and depreciation and amortization costs. However, these factors were offset by higher working capital requirements related to natural gas inventories. Our capital expenditures totaled $736.1 million in 2014, a $48.7 million increase compared to 2013. We saw higher construction expenditures related to the conversion of the Valley power plant to natural gas and investments in our distribution infrastructure. And we paid $352 million in common dividends in 2014, which was $23.1 million greater than in 2013. We\u2019re also pleased to report that our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2014, which is more than our 2013 ratio of 52.5%. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401k plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except for the Integrys acquisition. I\u2019ll now report on 2014 Electric deliveries to our customers. Delivered electricity reflects the demand from both our retail and electric choice customers and thus is a good indicator of how the regional economy is faring. Weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity excluding the mines rose by 0.004% during 2014 as compared to 2013. Actual deliveries were down by 0.007%. Looking at the individual customers segments, we saw normalized residential deliveries increase by 0.001% in 2014. Actual residential deliveries declined by 2.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather normalized deliveries declined by 0.001%. On an actual basis, full-year deliveries to this group were down 0.004%. Normalized deliveries to the large commercial and industrial segment for the full year 2014 excluding the iron ore mines were up by 1.3% for the year. Actual deliveries rose by 0.009% for the year. Overall for 2015, we are forecasting a modest increase of 0.001% in weather normalized deliveries, again excluding the iron ore mines. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on significant gains in energy usage by our customers. Looking at 2015 by individual customers segments, we expect the residential deliveries to grow by 0.002%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting an increase of 0.003%. In the large commercial and industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 0.003%. On the natural gas side of the business, total volumes in 2014 increased by 5.2%, driven partly by the colder weather. On a normalized basis, and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increase by 3.6% compared to 2013. We attribute this to an increase in customers, fuel switching to natural gas, and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry. Looking over the period 2015 through 2019, as a stand-alone company, we\u2019re projecting positive free cash flow totaling $300 million. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as the cash available after capital spending and dividends. Next, I\u2019d like to announce our standalone earnings guidance for 2015. We will revise our 2015 guidance after the Integrys acquisition has been completed. And as Gale already mentioned, we anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2015. As we discussed, our adjusted earnings in 2014 was $2.65 a share. Subtracting $0.03 for the impact of weather, we estimate that normalized adjusted earnings for 2014 were $2.62 a share. Taking this into account, we expect our adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes transaction related costs. Again, our guidance for 2015 on a stand-alone basis is $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. Finally, let\u2019s look at the first quarter guidance. Last year\u2019s first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share and that included $0.10 of weather benefit created by the polar vortex. In addition, the polar vortex helped last year\u2019s first quarter fuel recovery. Taking these two factors into account, we expect our first quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81 a share. That assumes normal weather and excludes transaction related costs. Once again, our first quarter 2015 guidance is $0.79 to $0.81 a share. And with that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well, perhaps just a couple of quick questions here clarifying first on the guidance, can you give us at all kind of any sensitivities around timing of the transaction and the close, basically about a one month delay in the close would be your \u2013 anything at all would just be helpful just from a timeline perspective. Gale Klappa : Julien, again, we\u2019re trying to give you for 2015 our standalone guidance, because no one is certain at this point the exact closing date and let me just iterate that a little more. Right now, July 6 would be the longest date that\u2019s been established out there, that\u2019s by the Illinois Commerce Commission for a vote. So we\u2019re saying we expect to close on the second half of 2015, much of the acquisition relates to acquiring natural gas distribution companies. Obviously, their sales are quite low in the third quarter. So we really unfortunately can\u2019t give you any more precise information about the impact of one month or not, really it does depend upon the month of the season, depends upon the weather, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a huge impact one way or another. We are still expecting to close in the second half. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps secondly, can you talk about a little bit of the drivers in the shift in capex here, just a little bit more around the increase, what drove that or where is it kind of usual rolling forward? Gale Klappa : Couple of things. About two thirds of our overall capital spending over the course of the several years, we will be focused on upgrading our ageing electric and natural gas distribution networks, particularly the electric distribution networks. And that\u2019s very much age-driven. If you look at the reliability of the equipment in our industry, which as you know is incredibly reliable, you start to see the significant uptick in failure rates after the equipment reaches age 50. So we are focusing our upgrades, we are focusing our replacements on equipment that is reaching or passing that age. And we\u2019re seeing more equipment and we are seeing more investment requirement related to upgrading those electric distribution networks. I think overall, if you look at our rolling 10-year capital plan, it\u2019s up pan about $100 million from the last 10-year plan. Patrick Keyes : Julien, this is Pat, let me just add a couple of things. I think if you look at 2014 versus 2013, I think I said about $50 million round number in additional capital spend and about half of that we had projected because, as Gale mentioned, that\u2019s largely driven by delivery of the future. If you look at the last number we had in our investor presentation that we ended up the year about $25 million ahead of that and that increment is largely driven by gas lateral expansions as people got off for propane, we grew our gas distribution spending to help facilitate those customers conversion. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps just lastly, can you comment on weather normalized trends, I know you can to a certain extent, but just expand on 2015, if you will, a little bit, and what may be some of the key drivers might be if you think about sensitizing it? Gale Klappa : Sure, be happy to Julien. Let me start with the large commercial and industrial customers, our large customer group. And that\u2019s an interesting statistic that we did not put in the script, but I think is worth mentioning. If you look at our delivered volumes of electricity to our large customers for 2014 and include the iron ore mines up in the Upper Peninsula, which we\u2019re still responsible for delivery regardless of where their supply comes from, if you look at that customer segment, weather normal, it was actually up 3.8% during 2014. That\u2019s pretty strong industrial growth in 2014. We are projecting virtually flat for that customer segment in 2015, coming off that big uptick in 2014, and that\u2019s based really on the input we received from our large customers when we interviewed them in the fall of the year as we finalize our forecast. So in essence, what we are expecting on the large commercial and industrial side of our business is to sustain the growth that occurred in 2014 to probably stay pretty close to that level. That\u2019s really the insight that I would give you on our large commercial and industrial. And then in essence, for residential weather normal, for commercial weather normal, basically a little bit of growth offset by conservation and a net-net of flat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Just firstly on transmission, it looked like the number ticked down in the fourth quarter, why would that be? Gale Klappa : There\u2019s a very good reason for that and will let Pat answer as to why. Patrick Keyes : Jonathan, as you know, there is a possibility that the ROEs are going to be adjusted for the ATC and others across the country for that matter. So it\u2019s part of our \u2013 we have taken \u2013 we reserved against that possibility. Jonathan Arnold : Can you quantify that, how much of the impact it was on the quarter? Patrick Keyes : I think we\u2019ve talked about in the past, if you kind of use the guidelines of the Massachusetts ruling, 10.57 to 11.74 ROE, that\u2019s somewhere between $0.01 and $4.5. We kind of took a look at that and use that as our guidance. We were probably closer to the $0.01 side of it, but that was kind of a yardstick, if you will, we used to kind of beside where we are going to, how appropriate was to reserve. Gale Klappa : So basically, we took a small charge in the fourth quarter and then we embedded an estimate of slightly lower ROEs in our 2015 guidance to you. So the numbers that Pat showed you or mentioned to you, in our 2015 guidance band of $2.67 to $2.77, that assumes also a slightly lower at the top end and bottom end slightly lower ROE outcome once FERC decides the MISO case in, we think, the second half. Jonathan Arnold : Just to be clear, did you use the New England number or did you take the New England methodology and mark it to today, I guess, plus the 50 basis points? Patrick Keyes : Using the New England number as a guidepost, we based our analysis on a different way, I guess, is the simplest way to say it. The other way to look at it, I\u2019ll add on Gale\u2019s 2015 point, I mean we obviously got a range of guidance and part of the driver of that range of guidance is where will that return fall in. Jonathan Arnold : I\u2019m still not quite clear, you say did you use the 10.57 or did you use that to mark it? Gale Klappa : What we really did was we said, okay, at one end of the spectrum, and we\u2019re not going to be precise, Jonathan, about the spectrum, but at one end of the spectrum, the decline could be X cents, at the lower end of the spectrum, it could be Y cents, and we embedded the X and the Y in the guidance we have given you. Jonathan Arnold : One other, we noticed there was an order to show cause out of the MPSC with relation to the Upper Peninsula I think yesterday, could you comment on that? Gale Klappa : Sure, would be happy to. First of all, I want to make sure everyone understands that this particular order that came out yesterday afternoon is a separate docket completely from our merger docket. So we really don\u2019t see any real link between the two. And we\u2019ve just had a quick review obviously of the order itself, but couple of points. First of all, we believe the Michigan Commission wants some very broad input from a whole range of parties on units that receive or could receive the SSR, the subsidy, the system support resource payments from MISO and where the state authority starts and ends and where the federal authority starts and ends for units that have these SSR payments or could have these SSR payments in the future. So that I think is the nut of where the intent of that particular docket that the Commission opened is and we\u2019ll be happy to work with the Commission, we\u2019ll be happy to provide our input. But also I want to assure you that there is no issue with making sure that we have adequate supply for as long as we own the assets in the Upper Peninsula to meet customer needs. That really is our intention, obviously we will keep the Presque Isle units open under MISO direction for as long as they need to be. Jonathan Arnold : So there\u2019s no kind of sense that they\u2019re going cold on the settlement or anything like that? Gale Klappa : I\u2019m sorry, just the opposite. I mean, if you think about how the settlement was put together, the Governor\u2019s office, the Michigan State Attorney General, the PSC staff and the iron ore mines are all parties to the settlement. And certainly, from everything we are sensing and everything we can tell are fully, fully on board with the settlement. This is a separate docket entirely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : The fourth quarter ATC kind of booked reserve for the full year or is it just related to the fourth quarter? Gale Klappa : No, for the entire year. In fact, back to November of 2013. Paul Ridzon : And have the mines come back to your service? Gale Klappa : Mines are home as of February 1. Paul Ridzon : And is that baked into your guidance or is that...? Gale Klappa : Well, no, because under the way rates have been set, associated with serving the mines will be deferred on our balance sheet. Paul Ridzon : Deferred until the next rate case or...? Gale Klappa : Yes, deferred, the margin and the cost \u2013 the cost and then resulting in the margin will be deferred until the next rate case. Paul Ridzon : And weather for the year was $0.03 positive versus normal? Patrick Keyes : Correct. Paul Ridzon : And then lastly, what do you think as far as continued growth out of the sand mining industry, given that this is frac sand? Gale Klappa : Very interesting question and actually there\u2019s been a lot of analysis over the last couple of months, particularly as oil prices began to crater, about the impact in the western part of the state on the huge expansion we\u2019ve seen in frac sand mining. And for right now, we\u2019re actually not seeing any downturn at all in frac sand production in the western part of the state. And when we talk with the frac sand producers, they\u2019re still quite optimistic. Now, I would say the growth is going to level off and we\u2019re not going to see for the near term any significant additional growth, but they\u2019re not seeing any downturn either. And I think that\u2019s in part because Wisconsin has now become the number one supplier of frac sand in the country. It\u2019s the quality of the sand, it\u2019s the ease of getting that sand to market from where the sand mines are. So we\u2019re not seeing any real deterioration at this point and the customers that we are talking to out there don\u2019t expect to see any 2015 deterioration as well. Paul Ridzon : So we\u2019ve got a cost advantage to actually support them? Gale Klappa : I think they\u2019ve got a cost and quality advantage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Brian Russo : My questions were asked and been answered. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Real quick one, how should we think about what the value of the distribution assets in the Upper Peninsula are? I\u2019m trying to think through the cash you\u2019ll receive from that potential sale and then the amount that could potentially be rebated back to customers. Gale Klappa : I think we\u2019ll just give you a ballpark number here, and again, this is a very, very small part of our business. But the book value of the distribution assets is going to be in the neighborhood of $100 million. Michael Lapides : One other totally unrelated, total short-term debt at the end of the year is kind of that high point if I look relative to prior quarters, even prior year end, does kind of comparing year over year to past years, how should we think about what your plan for that is, what\u2019s driving that et cetera? Gale Klappa : Well, I\u2019m looking at Scott and Pat here. For one thing, we tend to tick up in Q4 anyway because of the buildup of natural gas inventories. Total short-term debt is going to be a little higher. If you\u2019re looking at it compared to Q3, it\u2019s always going to be higher. Really, I don\u2019t see any significant difference here, we were able to push off a bond offering, given our stronger cash flows during 2014, but we are kind of in a normal pattern here. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yeah, the short-term debt is really at the two utilities. So we\u2019ve have plenty of room and we have a lot of cash, we have some cash ex that holding company. So it\u2019s really just a timing of when we do debt issuance at future. Michael Lapides : Finally, can you talk about the impact of bonus depreciation on 2015 cash flow, how that impacts your EPS guidance? Gale Klappa : We certainly can talk about the cash flows, there won\u2019t be any real immediate impact on EPS. But Pat, how about talk about the cash benefit from bonus depreciation? Patrick Keyes : Michael, for us, that\u2019s about $115 million this upcoming year. So as Gale mentioned, because that was not part of the rate case and we\u2019re not going in for the rate case, there isn\u2019t any impact on it for this year that helps where you\u2019re heading on the rate base, I should be more clear. Michael Lapides : Got it. It would impact further down the road, but not in the immediate term? Patrick Keyes : That\u2019s correct, probably 2017. And remember, having said that, Gale also mentioned that our revised capital is up about $100 million, so net-net, it\u2019s probably in the same place. Michael Lapides : Yeah. And finally, can you actually just give us the walk 2015, 2016 and 2017 annual capex? Gale Klappa : Let\u2019s see if we broke it down in the materials we brought into the room of year by year, I can tell you that over the period, as I mentioned earlier, about two thirds of the capital spending will be tied to our distribution networks. We will have a disproportionate amount of capital spending this year because this is our big spending year for the western Wisconsin natural gas expansion, that 85 mile lateral that I mentioned and that\u2019s $170 million, $180 million, so you\u2019ll see more spending on natural gas distribution in our, what we call our lifesaver chart, where we have the colors in the bars, you\u2019ll see 2015 being an outsized year for natural gas distribution spending. But over the period of time, you\u2019re going to see about two thirds of the capital spend be on upgrading our distribution networks, particularly electric. Patrick Keyes : Michael, if you allow me to expand on the lifesaver theme and add some color to Gale\u2019s comments, at the utilities now, it\u2019s only there, that\u2019s the number I got in front of me, was about $700 million in 2014, and then will be around $770 million in 2015 with the largest part of the delta being the west central, and then we kind of flatten out to some $600 million, $650 million two years after that in 2016, 2017, if that helps. Michael Lapides : Got it. Last one, you\u2019re spending a little bit of capital at Oak Creek at the power the future plan, how should we think over a multi-year period what happens to the earnings trajectory of the power the future assets, I mean is that a flat earnings stream, is this going to drive a little bit of earnings growth, is there some natural earnings growth embedded in the contracts or in the lease structure, how should we think about it? Gale Klappa : The simplest way to think about it is a slightly rising slope on a slightly rising stream of income from the power the future units. There are two reasons. One, there is some maintenance capital that we normally need to spend, you anybody needs to spend on power plants. So there will be small amounts of additional capital is the maintenance capital is spent. Then we\u2019re probably looking on a close to $90 million or so for the two projects that we are seeking Commission approval for, related to the additional cold storage capability and the plant modifications for fuel blending, which we covered in the script, so that would add to earnings. And then just in general, as we amortize the debt and the revenue stream stays the same, you would expect slightly higher annual earnings as you amortize and pay down the debt. So I would look at it as a gently rising stream. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : I just wanted to follow-up on Jonathan Arnold's question with respect to the show cause order because I'm a little confused. First of all, it doesn't seem like they've referenced the settlement at all. But the settlement, as I understand it, was supposed to deal with the concerns about reliability regarding the Upper Peninsula, correct? Gale Klappa : Yes, correct. Paul Patterson : And it was pretty thorough, like you said, all of the things you said. But then when you read this, they say that, at present, Wisconsin Electric is unable to provide the Commission with assurance of reliable supply of electric service given it has announced its intention to retire the PIPP, the Presque Isle. And they emphasize this urgent problem with constrained capacity on the Upper Peninsula will continue for years. What I don't understand is you guys are supposed to be selling this asset and what have you, it will be sort of the up goes issue, I would think. I'm just a little confused as to, A, I know it's their order and what have you, but if you could give us any insight that you have on this and that. They seem to be making an issue about something that the settlement was designed to deal with and they're not referring to the settlement. It just seems odd. It just seems like it's coming out of nowhere, if you know what I'm saying. Gale Klappa : You are asking a very good question, our view after reading the order and having some discussions, our view is that this docket is all about a much narrower policy issue related to these systems support resource payments. We don\u2019t think it has anything to do with a broader docket. There are a number of units as you know in Michigan now, not just ours, not just the Presque Isle plant, but there are a number of units getting these systems support resource payments either because the owner had planned to suspend or retire the units. So our view is while I understand your confusion, our view is this really a much narrower docket associated with where are the state authorities, where are the federal authorities as it relates to these units that either could get or are receiving SSR payments. I hope that helps. Paul Patterson : It does help. What I'm a little confused about is why are they only asking you to show cause? It just seems like, why not get those other \u2013 I could understand a broader investigation, like they want to keep on top of it, et cetera. I just don't understand why it's like, we're asking Wisconsin Energy to show cause as to what the issue is, particularly if it looks like in the near future you guys aren't really going to be in the picture anywhere near to the degree you are. Gale Klappa : Well, I think maybe they got us on speed dial, you never know. Paul Patterson : Okay, I don't mean to make too much of it. I'm just a little confused by it, that's all. Gale Klappa : There may be one other reason to that. In terms of the magnitude of the SSR payments, Presque Isle is clearly, the units that are getting the biggest payments by far, so that may have been part of their thinking. I\u2019m speculating on that, because we really don\u2019t know, want to know more, until we get further into it. Paul Patterson : Okay. But just, generally, though, as far as you guys see it, the settlement is perfectly in place. You've heard no pushback or any issue associated with that and things are proceeding well with respect to the merger processes you're seeing. We shouldn't think anything else of it than just what you said, right? Everything else with respect to the merger and the constraint, the Upper Peninsula power reliability issues, all those you think are moving well, correct? Gale Klappa : I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. Paul Patterson : Okay, good. Thanks so much for the clarity. The rest of the stuff was answered, thank you. Just one thing \u2013 longer term, with respect to sales growth, do you guys have an updated outlook outside of 2015 which you guys already shared with us, what you think is going to be happening here? Gale Klappa : We\u2019re still looking longer term and a lot of the estimates we provided you longer term for capex et cetera are assuming about 0.5% electric sales growth annually. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Dan Jenkins : First, I just had a bit of a follow-up on the sands customers, the frac sands, any impact. I was just curious if you could let us know like how big is that revenue as part of the industrial, how big of a segment is that? Gale Klappa : Let me clarify, good question Dan, let me clarify one thing. We largely do not serve electricity in that region. So from a standpoint of the sand mining growth and the sand mining production, it\u2019s largely related to our natural gas distribution network. And of course, we\u2019re now to help certain of the sand mines, we\u2019re now building this 85 mile lateral that will increase our capacity to serve the sand mines. Scott, do you have an estimate of our total industrial, for example, our total industrial deliveries of natural gas? Scott Lauber : Yes, if you look at the volumes, it\u2019s a couple of percent. Gale Klappa : About 2%. Scott Lauber : ...in the sand area and that grew about 30% last year. Gale Klappa : Yeah, it was way up last year as Scott was saying 30% increase to the sand mining industry. Dan Jenkins : Okay. So it's more the margin and the volume than the overall total has been more the impact so far? Gale Klappa : I would agree with that, yes. Dan Jenkins : Another question I had is, just looking at the cash flow statement, you had about an $80 million swing in working capital. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what was driving that. Gale Klappa : A lot of that is natural gas inventory, but Steve Dickson, do you have a breakdown for us? Stephen Dickson : No, you\u2019re absolutely right, Gale. Gas and storage was about $71 million cash items, but the gas and storage, last year because it was so cold in the fourth quarter, in December, we drilled down balances and that was a positive cash flow. This year, two things, we build out inventories and the price at the end of this year is higher than last year. So that was the big driver. Dan Jenkins : Okay. And then you mentioned that the lower medical and benefit cost was a big driver. I was wondering, is that due to a change in your policy or is it more of a valuation thing related to interest rate changes, or what's going on there? Gale Klappa : Last year, good question again Dan, Dan you\u2019re on your game today. Last year was the first year, 2014 was the first year where all of our employees were receiving medical tariffs on high deductible plans. And we think that did have a positive impact. Also, just our medical experience, last year was better than normal. So it will be interesting to see how 2015 plays out, because we did have a very positive year in terms of medical benefit costs. And again, we are not sure how much of that relates to the fact that every employee is on a high deductible plan and how much of it was just a very good healthcare experience year. We have a lot of initiatives underway in the company on understanding exactly where you are individually with your health, we are really promoting wellness and it was good to see the results of 2014. Dan Jenkins : On page nine, just looked at the fourth quarter revenues, other operating revenues, you had a $21 million increase there. Is that what's going on there? I know you all said that Treasury grant thing or is there something related to that? Gale Klappa : Dan, I\u2019ll let Steve answer that question for you. Stephen Dickson : Dan, we announced that we have the SSR agreements and we started recognizing revenue associated with that. So in the fourth quarter, about $20 million of that increase relates to SSR revenues. That\u2019s probably an escrow to 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fidell with US Capital Advisors. Dan Fidell : Thanks for taking my question here. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just a quick question on the Integrys approval process. Certainly thanks for the timing detail in the script. There have been more than a few moving parts going on, both politically and personnel-wise in Illinois of late. A bit unusual I think for the state overall, but also to have that happen in the middle of a merger. How, if at all, do those shifts impact the approval process as it applies to you guys? Is there any additional thoughts you might have on that? Gale Klappa : No, well, actually we don\u2019t think there is any significant impact at all in that, when we first applied in the State of Illinois for approval, as you know there is a very large professional staff operating for the Illinois Commerce Commission, they have been down this road before in terms of two natural gas distribution companies being acquired in the last six years in Illinois. The staff proposed to an ALJ, by hearing schedule and a schedule for a Commission decision, and really we\u2019ve seen all the parties stick to the schedule. So far it\u2019s been a process that\u2019s unfolded very smoothly and very much to our expectations in terms of timing. And there is no indication at all that the July 6 date is anything different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Michael Weinstein : Hi guys. I figured I'd just jump in there, too, as well. But I think my questions have all been answered so way at the bottom of the pack. Gale Klappa : Well, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We really appreciate your participation. If you have any other questions, our famous Colleen Henderson will be available in the Investor Relations office at 414-221-2592. Thanks much everybody, take care.",

Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Colleen F. Henderson - Manager-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's Conference Call to Review 2015 First Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015. This compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group. Well, the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather. Though not nearly as extreme as the weather that gripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact, during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%. I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well, underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver the Future program. You may recall that as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are most susceptible to stress during severe weather. Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than the national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 0.6% in the first quarter. Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Through early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year. Now, later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business, and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all three criteria that we use to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Of course, that would be 2016. Second, we believe it will be largely credit neutral. And finally, we believe the long-term growth rate will be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a standalone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses. Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity. And over time, we'll enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers could actually see as much as $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin. In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States. ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company. Just a few weeks ago on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete. Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a three-year period beginning in 2016 any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above our allowed rates of return. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a new natural gas-fired generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6. In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fronts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of this summer. Now, before we discuss the status of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, in cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan Commission staff, and iron ore mines. We reached an agreement on March 12 that replaced the original arrangement we had announced in January. The revised agreement includes the following important elements. First, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant and our current electric distribution (8:40) assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from the new facility. This will allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Plant. And finally, Wisconsin Energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. Overall, we're very pleased with this result. And now turning to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral, which will span an 85 mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry. The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the three branch lines were installed by mid November. Construction of the third branch line began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete. Construction on the regulator stations is on schedule and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. We are on time, we are on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we are converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The two unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network. The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10, that's when unit two started its coal to gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit two should be completed by early fall in time for the next heating season. Unit one, of course, achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November. Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts. Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls Hydroelectric Plant, located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Construction activities have now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The upstream cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall the project is on time and on budget with approximately 42% of the work now finished. We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring, and we expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. So, after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. We have actually conducted limited testing on unit two at levels of up to a 100% PRB. Although, the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. So, last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB. We also need space on equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded cold storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval from both of these initiatives this summer. Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion for a five-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10-year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. Turning now to our dividend policy, our current standalone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with the Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings. In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys. And now, for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our two business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.08 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service. Operating income in the Non-Utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at the $23 million decline in operating income. During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations, and is directly related to an anticipated reduction and authorized returns for transmission companies. Our other income net increased by $1.9 million, largely because of higher AFUDC. AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pre-tax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015, or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings which exclude $0.04 of acquisition related costs were $0.90 per share. During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less than 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust, which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 million in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except of course for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys. We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 0.7% in the first quarter 2015, as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.1%. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 0.6%. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.5%. Our first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.8% compared to the polar-vortex-driven gas sales in last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year. Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start, but we still have nine more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O&M cost and lower benefits costs. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year. In addition, our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks much, Pat. Overall, we are solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : And now, we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Greg. How are you? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : How you doing? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I have two questions. The first one is how do you feel about the Packers draft? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : My summation of that is the Jets still suck. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fair enough. Fair enough. Probably true. Can you talk about the sales growth in the first quarter in the context of you still feeling like you are on track for the year? I know \u2013 because the residential weather-normal demand was down 3.1%. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Is that just sort of maybe a statistical issue or do you expect that to reverse later in the year? That's my main question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good question, Greg. The short answer is, yeah, I do think that the first quarter residential weather-normal numbers are a statistical anomaly. You've heard me say this before, but the weather-normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get two to three standard deviations off the norm. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly as it hit the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean we were way, way off the norm. So, I honestly don't put much stock in the weather-normal numbers for the first quarter. On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less weather sensitive, you saw an uptick of 0.6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So, as we've looked at this and believe me, we have analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we are on track overall for what we expected for the year. And we weren't expecting, as you know, significant uptick in kilowatt hour sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand. And again, I would take with a grain of salt the weather-normal numbers when you compare it to such an extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yes, thank you very much. When you talk to your industrial and commercial customers about their planned economic activity for the next 12 months, I know you do a lot of economic development and you stay very close to those... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We do. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...those customers. What is the tenor of \u2013 their mood about capital investment, hiring and the outlook? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say \u2013 and let me answer that in two ways. From the standpoint of commercial development, downtown office towers, retail centers being developed, we're seeing more commercial development than I think we've seen in the entire decade that I have been in this region. So our commercial customers, I would say, are showing just very solid optimism. Our industrial customers are, I would say, much more cautiously optimistic, nothing that would show huge growth, but on the other hand, I would say steady as she goes from the general input we're getting from our industrial customers. And then, of course, we should see an interesting development in the second quarter. You may recall me mentioning that Amazon has built a 1 million square foot, it's huge, a 1 million square foot distribution center south of Milwaukee and north of the Illinois line, that construction is complete. They're hiring and we should see that that 1 million square foot facility and a lot of ancillary development opening this summer. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much, Gale. Have a good day. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You take care, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : How you doing, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon to you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. So, first question here more on the balance sheet side of the equation. In terms of your pro forma metrics for the transaction, how do you see yourself trending within your targeted ranges? And ultimately as you see yourself more structurally what kind of metrics are you targeting pro forma, just perhaps with respect to your rating (27:40) but also even within that kind of the FFO metrics, if you will? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me start out by framing our overall objective, and then we can talk through some of the more specifics. Our overall objective, remember, going back to one of our three most important criteria for acquisitions would be that we would maintain largely credit neutrality for the acquisition. We would fully expect based on the input we're receiving from the credit rating agencies to maintain our A category credit rating. So that basically, fundamentally, where we expect to stay, and where we have planned to stay. And then of course, as you know, the agencies have very specific debt to total cap and FFO metrics tied to being in \u2013 being \u2013 qualifying to stay in that credit rating, but we would expect very much to stay within the A category credit rating. Current thinking, of course, is unchanged related to the amount of debt at the holding company that we would add for the acquisition. Right now, we are still projecting about $1.5 billion of debt at the holding company to complete the acquisition and that would be, Pat, in 3-year, 5-year and 10-year tranches. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And equally spread across the tranches. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So that's basically my general response to that. Perhaps Scott, Allen, anything you want to add? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Julien, was there something more specific you were after? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Well, I was just wondering where within those metrics \u2013 I mean how much pressure, you talk about maintaining largely credit neutrality, but just how much pressure probably at the lower end of that range within the FFO? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let me try it this way. The one thing that when we talked to the rating agencies almost a year ago now, there is nothing going on at the utilities, so the only activity we focused on and they focused on was at the holding company. And you may have seen \u2013 let's use Moody's as an example. In June of 2014, I believe we were \u2013 outlook was down... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Negative outlook. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Negative outlook, and then this morning they announced that we were on... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Negative watch. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, negative watch. That's all consistent. So I mean, in that, when we first went in and said we're going to put $1.5 billion acquisition down in the holding company, they said okay, that's what we think in June. Now, the triggering event was the Wisconsin Commission approval and now we took the next step. So, fairly consistent. I don't know I can get any more specific than that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. Hey, no worries. Thank you. And then just in terms of execution of the transaction, I know it's a little early here, but can you talk a little bit to the best practices and just ability to kind of, how should we say, turn around the Peoples Gas business and opportunity set there? I don't want to get too close to the synergies per se, but just kind of more qualitative, if you will. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I appreciate the questions, Julien, and I think very simply, let me start off with basically our overall mission statement. Once we complete the acquisition, we intend to function as one company, one team with seven customer facing brands, all focused on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. That's basically the mantra, the mission, and how we will go about achieving the important objectives that we've laid out for the transaction including meeting all three of the criteria that we continue to talk about is the criteria that we use for any acquisition opportunity. As you probably have read specifically related to your question on Peoples Gas, we were asked by the Illinois Commerce Commission what our plans would be for management of Peoples Gas and we responded to the Illinois Commission in writing committing that we would essentially place a minimum of three new senior officers from our team at Peoples Gas. So that will be one of the first steps that we will take immediately following the acquisition. We will put a very experienced professional, solid management team in place at People Gas. We're going to find, we know this already some very talented people in the operational ranks with Peoples Gas. So I think we're going to have a really solid team from day one at Peoples Gas and the Peoples Gas organization will report directly to me. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then lastly \u2013 were you saying something? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Obviously, I hope that gives you a flavor. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely. Just the last little detail. In terms of the timeline for closing you said late summer if I have it right. Is there any... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think we said by the end of the summer. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. Just in terms of the ICC schedule, is there any reason to think that it couldn't close earlier if you look at it at present? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, if we look at it at present, the Illinois Commerce Commission with the regulations and procedures that they follow in a case like this by statute unless there is some decision to delay, the Illinois Commerce Commission would make a decision by no later than July 6. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then you would close very shortly thereafter in theory? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Once we receive the final approval, we'll close probably within three business days. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Just checking on the verbiage there. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Thank you, Julien. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, how are you today? Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Gale, how are you? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm good. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : That's good. So just on the Illinois approval, it sounds like they kept the timeline despite some parties concerned about this investigation going on at the \u2013 one of Peoples Gas's programs. Could you just talk about that? And I guess maybe more importantly just how you've gotten comfortable that that is not an issue? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I'd be happy to, Steve. Well, first of all, just to explain the procedure with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The State Attorney General in Illinois filed a motion with the administrative law judge that is presiding over our merger case, petitioning the administrative law judge to, in essence, delay a ICC decision on our merger from the statutory deadline of July 6 for an additional 90 days, while the review continues on the management of the advanced main replacement program that Peoples Gas is undertaking. Both we and Integrys felt that a delay was not necessary, because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the manner in which the gas main replacement program has been managed. So there's a separate docket underway that will probably go on for a number of months. The administrative law judge determined that a delay was simply not necessary and ruled in favor of no delay, the commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6. So I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint. In terms of the review of the \u2013 what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement program, the Illinois Commerce Commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how People's is managing that construction program. And of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive. It will last probably at least for a 10-year period. The legislation actually covers the 10-year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the City of Chicago. Some of those pipes, by the way, are Civil War era pipes, and really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed. That audit is well along an interim report. There is an auditing firm called Liberty and the Liberty report \u2013 the interim report is out and has been shared with us and we would expect, Allen, a final Liberty report I would assume within the next 30 days to 45 days. Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation : There is a draft that's already out... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation : ...of the final report. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, we have obviously been able to review all of the recommendations and all of the findings in the audit, both the interim findings and now the draft final review findings. And, Steve, that's how we're comfortable that that this program is manageable and it's certainly needed from the standpoint of upgraded infrastructure. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just to clarify, in Wisconsin and the way the sharing works, my understanding is that above your ROE you share 50/50 for the first 50 basis points and then above that level earnings would be used to pay down this deferral balance? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Is that essentially how this works? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. We have a number of transmission costs that have been deferred on our balance sheet, that's we call it the transmission escrow. And what the commission has asked us to do, as you say correctly, above our authorized rates of return at Wisconsin Electric, which is 10.2 right now on that retail utility. So the first 50 basis points that we might earn in any years 2016, 2017 or 2018 above the 10.2, we would share with customers 50/50, stockholders would keep 50%. The customer would receive the benefit through paying down the transmission escrow. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rock and roll, Brian, how are you? Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good, thank you. Actually all my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Can you think of a new question that hasn't been asked or answered, Paul? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I have got a handful of them, thanks. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good for you. All right. Give us your best shot here, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Pat, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly that the lower transmission was a function of the fact you are booking to a lower ROE? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. We are... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And are you disclosing that ROE? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We've taken our best shot in the zone of reasonableness and we invite you to do the same. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And the merger costs showed up on the O&M line on the income statement, all of them? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So net-net, excluding those, O&M was actually down for the quarter. What drove that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, you are absolutely correct. O&M was down for the quarter on an ongoing operational basis and it was really effective cost controls across virtually every part of our organization. It's not just one thing, but it clearly was very good cost control across, literally, every organization. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And absent outage timing, should that continue through the year? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We will see. I will say one thing. We did benefit, for example, on the gas distribution side of our business. We had \u2013 even with the colder than normal weather, we had materially fewer gas leaks to respond to this year and that's I think a direct benefit from the investments we've been making in our gas distribution network. So, the fact that we wouldn't experience severe weather in the next two quarters might mean that we don't see those kind of O&M savings on the gas side of our business. But by and large, I mean, our folks have just done a tremendous job of managing effectively from the standpoint of cost control. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then I think when you gave initial guidance, Presque Isle was still getting SSR payments. How has the turn of events kind of changed \u2013 how does that play into guidance? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it doesn't play into guidance. We are no longer receiving SSR payments, but it doesn't play into guidance because the way rates were set at the end of 2014, in essence, the revenues, the margins from any sales to the mines, which have now basically stepped back into a power sales arrangement with us, any revenues and margins from those sales would really go to \u2013 go into escrow for dealing in the next \u2013 for treatment in the next rate case. Allen? Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation : Right. And then you also escrow for SSR revenues. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation : So, what Gale was explaining is that they made an assumption about SSR revenues. And to the extent that SSR revenues in this case are less, you book an escrow item. And then to the extent we get margin from the mines, you escrow that as well. So, it just all goes up on the balance sheet and there really is no income statement impact. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. So, on the balance sheet, it's like Ragu, it's in there. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then kind of relative to 1Q guidance, I think you beat the midpoint by $0.10. Can you kind of explain where that came from? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, basically \u2013 and I'll frame it and Pat can give you some more specifics, but essentially, there are a couple of drivers. One would be \u2013 in terms of our guidance, one would be the colder weather that drove stronger gas and electric margins than we had anticipated in the budget; and the second is largely O&M control. Pat? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. I'll just put a little color to that, Paul. I agree completely with Gale. Weather was roughly $0.05 better than what we thought versus the guidance, and O&M was roughly $0.03 better. And again the best example of that, as Gale mentioned, was the gas expense for leaks. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Sounds good. Thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, Caroline. How are you doing? Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Good afternoon. I was just curious if you could remind us what base year you are using when guiding to the 5% to 7% EPS CAGR for the pro forma company. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the 5% to 7% combined company EPS projection really would be off of the year 2015. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And then also a minor question here, but what should we expect transaction costs to be for the full year in 2015? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it depends upon how well Susan Martin controls our attorneys. And so far, that ain't so good. No, actually our attorneys have done very, very good work obviously and we're very much on schedule in terms of all the approval process. I'm looking at Pat to see if you have a total for this year only. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. For this year only, about $20 million to $30 million and that's... Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's just the out-of-pocket lawyers and bankers. That's not all the other stuff that goes around change of control, et cetera. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is \u2013 Pat is correct. That's the out-of-pocket expenses, legal fees, investment banking fees, expert witness fees, other outside consultant fees that are required as we work through the regulatory process. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Just one more minor one. In your earnings package you guys talked about rate cases adding $14.7 million versus last year. Is that kind of a good run rate assumption for the rest of the year in each quarter in terms of the benefit? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I would not use that as a run rate. Pat? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think this quarter is going to be a little higher. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And the reason for that is if you look back at 2014, January, we did not collect SSR. So that delta is going to be higher. In this quarter, so \u2013 then running out will be the same. So whatever you see in Q2 might be a good prediction, but one is a little high. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome, Caroline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Michael, do you have any more of those blue things we drank one night? Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No. I have not. That's a good idea. It's been a while. It's been a couple of years. We should catch up on that if we can find that place. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Two questions. One, really a little bit of a follow-up on Caroline's one. Can you remind us what were the rate increases \u2013 base rate increases granted in 2015 by the PSC for both WEPCO and WG? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We didn't \u2013 have got the specific numbers here with us and we're going to ask Scott Lauber or Pat to give you that. Overall, when you take into account a fuel cost reduction that we were able to put into rates (45:05), overall, our electric rates are only up about 0.1%, but it differs between customer segments. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President : Yeah. That's correct. So, Wisconsin Electric is just up a small 0.1%; if you put the fuel and it's actually down about 0.4%; and if you look at Wisconsin Gas, it was up about 2.6% on the margin. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, my apologies, I may have asked the question poorly. I recall that there was a base rate increase at WEPCO for this year? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There was. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Can you just \u2013 let's leave fuel out of the equation, I'm just trying to think about base rates. Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President : Yeah, the base rates were up were 0.1%, but remember, we're giving about 0.5% back as a credit this year and that credit was really like a base rate, it increase also. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, a long story short, I would use 0.1%. Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President : That's what the customers are seeing. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the customers for base rates are seeing 0.1%. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So, on an annualized basis I'm just trying to get to a rough dollar millions number here, okay? I just wanted to sanity check that, because I don't know why I thought it was somewhere in kind of the $30 million to $45 million for WEPCO. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Because you're probably not far off. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's fine. I can follow up offline. Second, on \u2013 when you look at your businesses, electric and gas utilities, do you see when you kind of look out too hard to predict 10 years down the road, but next two years to three years, two years to four years, one side of the business growing faster than the other, meaning electric growing faster than gas or maybe something we haven't seen in a long time, gas growing faster than electric? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, if I were a betting man, I would project that we would see gas \u2013 our gas distribution business growing slightly faster than our electric business for a couple of reasons. One, clearly, just the low price of natural gas; and secondly, the opportunity that we have to continue to gain customers through switching from propane to natural gas. You may have heard me say this before, but the national statistics from a year ago would indicate that Wisconsin is one of the five heaviest using propane states in the United States. And I think there is a tremendous opportunity for customer growth. Forget about per usage customer for a minute, but I think there is a tremendous opportunity for customer growth as we continue to see customers wanting to switch to our natural gas distribution network. In fact, I mentioned in the script, the uptick in customer growth that we are seeing and it's double-digit so far this year compared to the uptick we saw even last year. So to make a long story short, if I were a betting man, I would say, gas grows faster than electric by a bit over the next four years to five years. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And can you frame for us what percentage of the potential kind of addressable market is actually using propane versus natural gas in Wisconsin? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The last number I saw, but please don't hold me to this, was that there were a couple of \u2013 somewhere between 220,000 and 250,000 propane users still in the state. Now many of them are in rural areas, where there is not a strong natural gas distribution networks. I don't want to mislead you that a quarter of a million customers could automatically just switch tomorrow to natural gas. But it gives you a sense of what the longer term prospects might look like. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And finally on electric transmission, you are booking a lower ROE, this isn't a \u2013 you are not booking a charge related to a potential refund, you are booking a \u2013 this is an assumed number up, an ROE percentage that you think will be the adjudicated number that comes out of the MISO case and what you will earn on until whatever future rate filing occurs 5 years or 10 years down the road. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. You've phrased it exactly correctly. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciating. Congrats on a good quarter. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Greetings, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hi. How're you doing? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're great. How're you doing? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm managing. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Wait a minute. I thought you \u2013 last time you told me you were wonderful and award winning. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I got that, but then I will strive, how about that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We appreciate that, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Yeah. I want to follow up on Steve's question on this gas main thing, because just to make sure I understand this. Is the gas \u2013 this accelerated main replacement issue, is that now out of this merger case and in the separate dockets that they opened up because of whistleblowers? So, we are not going to hear about this anymore? Because I'm just trying to \u2013 it seems that the AG's always coming out going back to this thing saying this is some \u2013 she is very upset about it and what have you. So I'm just trying to \u2013 is it out of the case? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think, well, let me answer it two ways. I think you probably will continue to hear about it, but in terms of technically, the whistleblower letters and the review of the program \u2013 well, let me put it this way. The whistleblower letters and our review of those whistleblower letters and any other investigations that are going on are now part of a separate docket. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Separate and apart from the merger case. But that doesn't mean that someone couldn't inject a discussion about it in our merger case. But it might be helpful, Paul, to clarify for you where we stand in the merger case itself. In essence, all the hearings have been completed, all the testimony is in, all the briefs are done and we would expect some time in the next few \u2013 certainly in the next couple of weeks, we would expect to see a draft order by the administrative law judge who is hearing the case. So once that draft order is out, then all the parties will have a comment \u2013 will have an opportunity to comment on the draft order, after that then the draft order will go to the commissioners themselves for a final decision. So in terms of evidence, in terms of positions in the case, all of that is basically in the record and the record is now essentially closed other than comments on a draft order, if that's helpful to you. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : That's very helpful. And then so I mean, does the settlement makes sense at this point given how far along everything is? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : At this point, well, this being this close to a draft order, my own view would be the most sensible thing to do is to let the process play out and the process is getting close to the deadline. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And if you think about sitting here on today we're at May 5, we would be less than 60 \u2013 well, about 60 days away from the statutory deadline for a decision. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And now you've actually seen the Liberty Consulting report which I'm afraid I have not, I guess it's been publicly released now. Is that right? Or it's just you guys who get it. I don't know, because I... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not sure that it's been publicly released, but the commission asked or gave us specific authority and all the parties were fine with us reviewing the material in the interim Liberty report and in the draft \u2013 as Allen said, draft final report. So yes, we have seen the review. We have seen the audit. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So you guys are in a great position to answer some of these \u2013 well, I am not going to ask you to go over all of it. But I mean it just this idea that the budget has ballooned according to some of the filings that they are attributing to this program and that it is \u2013 that they are behind schedule and way over budget, I guess, is basically sort of what we are hearing. When you look at it, and knowing what you know about obviously gas utility work and what have you, you guys feel comfortable that this is a program that can be managed and completed in a commercially effective way, is that a good way to put it or do you follow me? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me answer it this way. There are a lot of moving pieces in terms of what the eventual cost might be. But do we believe based on what we've seen that, A, the work is needed; and B, it can be done professionally and in a long-term cost effective way? Yes. But at this point, I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on what the exact right budget number should be. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But as we look at the recommendations from the Liberty audit, I mean the recommendations frankly make a great deal of sense. There is nothing in the Liberty audit that I have seen that is troublesome from the standpoint of can we effectively manage the program. I'm confident we can. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're more than welcome. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right, ladies and gentlemen, well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate you participating. If you have any other questions, the famous Colleen Henderson is available in our Investor Relations office at 414-221-2592. Thanks again, everybody. Have a great day.",

Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call to review the 2015 Second Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by each company could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us, as we review our second quarter results. As I'm sure you know, on June 29 we acquired Integrys in a $9 billion transaction to form WEC Energy Group. We now serve 4.4 million electric customers and natural gas customers across four Midwestern states. I'll provide you with much more detail on the new company shortly, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. I'd also like to welcome Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, many of you know Beth from her work over the past decade or so as one of the more perceptive analysts covering our industry. I want to tell you we've forgiven her for that, and we're delighted that she's with us. Turning now to the second quarter, Pat will review our financial results in detail a bit later on the call, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share for the second quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share for the second quarter of 2014. I should point out that the numbers we're reporting to you today reflect Wisconsin Energy only. Since the acquisition closed on June 29, Integrys earnings were immaterial. Taking a very quick look now at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% in June, well below the national average. Deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, however, excluding the iron ore mines, fell by 1.4% in the second quarter. But several sectors showed strength including plastics, printing, and food processing. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment is growing, with electricity use rising by 2.3% over the second quarter of a year ago. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are up 8.2% and new natural gas installations are up 4% compared to the same time period last year. Now I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighed it against our three important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. After considerable due diligence we found that it met or exceeded all three criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We also saw tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach, and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage those strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve, to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and reduce costs. So what does our new footprint look like? Well, as I mentioned the new company provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers across four states through our customer- facing brands : We Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities, and Minnesota Energy Resources. Our company operates in a balanced regulatory environment with greater jurisdictional diversity than before the acquisition. And of course, more than 99% of our earnings will come from regulated operations. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States, with significant opportunities for growth. Of course, the majority of the earning assets we acquired are here in Wisconsin, a familiar landscape for us, and major infrastructure upgrades are underway now at Wisconsin Public Service in the northern part of the state. These investment opportunities are similar to those we have pursued over the years, on time and on budget, at We Energies. We are also in excellent position to take advantage of new customer growth across the region, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota, where propane and oil users are continuing to convert to natural gas. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys and Wisconsin Energy were the two largest owners of American Transmission Company. Today WEC Energy Group has become a 60% owner of ATC. As you will recall, ATC plans to invest between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion between 2014 and 2023 to bolster electric reliability in our service area. We believe this is a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. Now I would like to briefly discuss some of the conditions we agreed to as we worked our way through the regulatory approvals for the acquisition. In Wisconsin, we committed to an earnings cap for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas subsidiaries. Starting in 2016, next year, we will share with our customers any earnings in excess of our allowed rate of return. The first 50 basis points of earnings above our authorized return will be split equally between the company and our customers. Then any earnings above that level will go exclusively to customers. This sharing mechanism will be in effect through 2018. We also agreed to develop an integrated resource plan detailing the joint capacity needs of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. We expect to file the resource plan with the Wisconsin Commission later this quarter. In Michigan, as we've discussed on previous calls, we expect to pursue the formation of a Michigan-only utility. Our customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would be served by this entity. And we expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from a new facility. This would allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Power Plant. In Illinois, we agreed to retain a minimum level of jobs in the State of Illinois for the next two years. We also committed to a two-year base rate freeze and a capital spending floor from 2015 through 2017. In a recent development this past Friday, the Citizens Utility Board, the City of Chicago and the State Attorney General's Office asked the Illinois Commerce Commission to rehear our merger order. These parties are seeking additional conditions, conditions that they previously requested during the year-long approval process. The Illinois Commission now has until August 13 to accept or deny the request. We believe the Commission's June 24 decision was correct and is supported by sound principles and by an extensive body of evidence. Now let's touch on some of the key financial metrics for the new company. For starters, as you may recall we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt is approximately 2.2% annually, an excellent result and clearly lower than we anticipated. So for 2016 we now project our growth in earnings per share to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The 6% to 8% growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy standalone achieves earnings of $2.72 a share this year, which is the midpoint of our current 2015 guidance. So, just to clarify, we start with a base of $2.72 a share for our standalone earnings this year, and we expect the combined company to grow earnings per share in the 6% to 8% range next year. For the longer term, after 2016 we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline, and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. We look forward to providing you with additional details on our capital investment plans at the EEI Finance Conference coming up in November. Regarding our dividend policy, in June, the Wisconsin Energy Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 a share. That's an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. Going forward we will target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Switching gears now, I'd like to update you on several of our major construction projects. On the generation side of our business, as you may recall, we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units as part of our ongoing Power the Future initiative. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal; however, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. During extensive testing, we identified operational and equipment-related improvements that will be needed to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. In May, the Wisconsin Commission approved our requests for additional capital spending for plant modifications, expansion of all of our coal storage capacity, and additional coal handling equipment. We've already started work to expand our coal storage capability, and the first in-plant capital improvements are expected to be made on the first unit at Oak Creek, the Oak Creek expansion, during a planned outage this September. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of 2016. Our share of these investments is targeted at approximately $80 million. Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. That conversion is now more than 80% complete. Total conversion costs are expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the project on time and on budget before the end of this year. Our Western Wisconsin natural gas expansion project, which will address natural gas reliability concerns in the western part of the state, is now more than 75% complete and is running on time and better than budget. We expect to complete this new 85-mile natural gas pipeline in the fourth quarter of this year at a cost actually well below the $175 million budget, a budget that again excludes allowance for funds used during construction. Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in Wisconsin Energy's traditional business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on Delivering the Future. Just to remind you, Wisconsin Energy's standalone capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the five-year period 2015 through 2019, and our 10-year standalone capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. Now before I turn the call over to Pat, I would also like to discuss our plans for the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. Just to refresh your memory, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipeline system over the next 20 years. Some of these pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the time of the Civil War. One of our immediate and most important goals is to improve the management and performance of this project. Our first step was to appoint a new senior management team at Peoples : a new President, a new Vice President for construction, a new operations Vice President, and a new Vice President for customer service. All of them are proven, experienced leaders from the Wisconsin Energy system. Over the past three weeks, our team has conducted a thorough evaluation of the accelerated main replacement program. They have determined that the best approach is a fresh start. We have begun transitioning the management of the project to in-house personnel; previously the project was managed by an outside contractor. Going forward, we also plan to engage a nationally recognized firm to help conduct an independent, bottom-up review of the cost, scope, and schedule for the program. This past Monday we notified the Illinois Commerce Commission of our decisions, and we will incorporate these decisions into a broader transition plan. This broader transition plan will address the recommendations made by Liberty Consulting Group in their audit of the program. The Liberty audit was completed earlier this year at the request of the Illinois Commerce Commission. I am confident that the steps we are taking will ensure that Chicagoans get the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. In conclusion, these are exciting times, filled with opportunity for our new combined company and we believe we have a very bright future ahead. We will build an enduring enterprise by focusing on the fundamentals : world-class reliability, operating efficiency, financial discipline, and exceptional customer care. And now for more details on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat. J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Because of the timing of the acquisition, earnings results this quarter are exclusively from Wisconsin Energy. Going forward, our consolidated earnings will include the operating results of the Integrys companies. Please note that the balance sheet included in this quarter's earnings package does incorporate the Integrys balance sheet. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for Wisconsin Energy's two business segments, and then discuss other income, interest expense, and income taxes. Excluding acquisition related costs, second quarter consolidated operating income was $232.5 million, as compared with $245.8 million in 2014. That's a decline of $13.3 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $140.4 million for 2015, a decline of $14.8 million from the second quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our earnings were helped by $9.5 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case and by $3.4 million related to improved fuel recoveries. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $18.5 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects, and certain benefit costs. We estimate that weather reduced our margins by $4.8 million and we also saw increased depreciation expense of $4.2 million. Combining these and other factors results in the $14.8 million decline in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2015, compared with the same quarter in the prior year. Operating income in our non-utility energy segment was $93.5 million, which is $1.8 million higher than the prior year. Our corporate and other segment, which includes corporate costs of smaller affiliates, was essentially flat with last year's second quarter. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the second-quarter operating income before acquisition-related costs of $232.5 million, a $13.3 million decline as compared to the second quarter of 2014. In addition, for the second quarter of 2015 we recognized $66.7 million of acquisition-related costs associated with benefit plan agreements, legal and banking fees, and other costs. Overall these costs were in line with our expectations. During the second quarter of 2015, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $14.3 million, a decline of $3.2 million from the same period in the prior year. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC related to authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. Our earnings reflect Wisconsin Energy's share of ATC's results. Our other income net increased by $18 million. During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized an incremental gain of $15.2 million on the sale of the legacy asset. The purchase and sale of assets is a regular part of our business. In fact, we have a real estate development subsidiary, and this quarter's sale was part of our financial plan for the year. Our net interest expense increased by $3.1 million, primarily because of higher debt levels. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $11.1 million for the quarter. Going forward, WEC Energy Group's annual effective income tax rate, driven by a one-time adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% in 2015. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for 2015 will be between 37% 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to the adjusted net income of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. During the first six months of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $715.9 million, which is a $5.4 million decrease from the first six months of 2014. During 2015, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans; no such contributions were made during 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital. For example, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage. Our capital expenditures totaled $356.5 million in the first six months of 2015, a $51 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the increased expenditures related to the western gas lateral. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio as of June 30th, 2015 was 50.7%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition, treating half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $190.5 million in common dividends in the first six months of 2015. That's an increase of $14.5 million over the same period last year. Weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Actual second quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%. Looking now at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell 5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries rose by 2.4%. Actual deliveries rose by 2.3%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2015 fell by 2.5%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 1.4%. Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding the gas used for power generation, were flat compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding the gas used for power generation, were down 7.2% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first six months of 2015 are slightly behind our expectations for the year. Turning now to our earnings forecasts, for the remainder of 2015 we will continue to guide based on standalone Wisconsin Energy earnings. As Gale mentioned, our long-term earnings per share growth rate is based upon these standalone earnings. We will therefore make the following adjustments to the WEC Energy Group GAAP earnings. Number one, remove the impact of Integrys; number two, remove the impact of acquisition debt. As Gale noted previously, we funded the 1.5 billion cash portion of the acquisition with $1.2 billion of long-term debt and $300 million of commercial paper. This long-term debt included 3, 5, and 10-year tranches. Overall, our debt has an approximate interest cost of 2.2% annually. Number three, remove the impact of acquisition and other one-time costs such as banking and legal fees. Number four, modify effective tax rates to remove the impact of the one-time adjustment I just referred to earlier. And finally, number five, remove the impact of the additional shares issued as part of the acquisition. With that, we'll move to our 2015 guidance. We are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We are off to a strong start, but still have six months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. And finally let's take a look at third quarter guidance. Last year's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.57 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Similar to last year, our summer got off to a very slow start this year, with temperatures significantly below normal during the first 10 days of July. So taking this July weather into account, we expect our third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in a range of $0.56 to $0.58 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining transition-related costs. Once again, our third quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.56 to $0.58 a share. And with that I will turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Pat, thank you very much. Appreciate the detail and the clarity. And overall, folks, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : And now we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Afternoon to you. Congrats on closing the deal finally, not too bad. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right, we'll see later this week. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Indeed we will. So perhaps the first question here out of the gate, the 5% to 7% earnings growth rate, when you are thinking about that in the context of this transaction being closed, how are you thinking about the trajectory in 2016 and reflecting some of the improvement, hopefully, in the earned ROEs across the legacy Integrys platform? And perhaps maybe could you remind us or refresh our memory of where the earned ROEs stand today, just for some background if you will. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure, I'd be happy to. Let me first start with the initial part of your question. How do we think about the trajectory of earnings going forward here now that we have closed the acquisition? As you may have heard me say on the script, given everything we see today and given the terrific result that we got in terms of the annual interest cost on the parent company debt, we are projecting 2016 to have a growth rate over our standalone 2015 guidance, the midpoint of that guidance. So we are projecting 2016 to grow 6% to 8%. And then post 2016 we still see a 5% to 7% growth rate. There are a couple of important underlying assumptions that we are making and that we really feel very good about delivering related to the growth rate. The first is that we believe we can through best practices, through cost reduction, through financial discipline, and through on-time and on-budget investing in the infrastructure upgrades that are needed, we believe we can move all of the utilities that are the former Integrys utilities at or near the allowed rates of return in Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, and of course WPS in Wisconsin. So that's a pretty important underlying assumption. And to your question of, well, where were the allowed rates of return for those utilities? Just a reminder that We Energies and Wisconsin Gas have historically earned at or very close to and in some years slightly above the allowed rates of return. With that, Pat has the specific numbers on where the other Integrys utilities have been from an ROE standpoint. Pat? J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So, Julien, let's start with the two biggest ones. Wisconsin Public Service last year earned just above 10%; and as a reminder its authorized was 10.2%, so just underneath allowed. The second biggest or the other big one would be Peoples Gas. That last year was about 5%, and that's out of an allowed 9%. Then the other three utilities last year \u2013 that would be North Shore, Minnesota, and Michigan, two of the three hit; one was beneath, but the year before, the one that missed hit and another one didn't. So they're more or less maybe slightly underneath on average is probably the simplest way to state that. Does that help? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely, that's great. And perhaps just getting back to my question a little bit more broadly, as you think about 2016 to 2017, are you earning a full year earned ROE? Just I'm trying to think about some of the continued benefits as you flow that forward, right. So thinking about the 5% to 7% in conjunction with what is likely \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth too much \u2013 but what is likely still an annualizing factor into that higher level, I would imagine. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm not sure I exactly followed you, but perhaps I can answer. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Or are you expecting to earn a full year at or near the ROEs in 2016 already, just to be clear about that, or is there an annualizing factor? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Starting in 2016 we are expecting to earn a full-year annualized rate of return, yes. And let me help with that one piece, because you're probably wondering like, well, how do you go from 5% to 9% at Peoples Gas? That's a very good question, Julien. I'm glad you asked it. Peoples Gas did get a resolution of a rate case in January of this year, and I believe the allowed increase was $71 million. A lot of that, Julien, was for catch-up capital that had already been invested in the infrastructure in Chicago. So the fact that a rate case has been adjudicated and they are seeing the benefit of the $71 million increase is helpful on that front. I hope that's helpful to you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : It is indeed. And sorry to belabor it, just one last one in terms of the integrated resource plan. How are you thinking about that now? Obviously there was some shifts in the gas generation plans earlier. What is the current expectation vis-\u00e0-vis load growth as you stand today, as you close the deal? Would you expect a shift back in generation resources meaningfully from what has been discussed through the course of this merger approval? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Let me try the first piece and then we're going to let Allen give you the detail on the integrated resource plan that we'll be filing later this quarter with the Wisconsin Commission. Long story short, there is no change in terms of our long-term demand growth projection. Wisconsin Public Service and our company have pretty similar demand growth projections going forward, roughly 0.05% a year basically in electricity demand growth. Our belief, though, when you look at the portfolio of generation that the two companies have together, our belief is there can be some real synergies there. Allen? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right, and just review for everyone, Julien, who might not know the Fox Energy Center, which is a plant that's owned by Wisconsin Public Service, before agreeing to the merger with Wisconsin Energy they had planned to build a facility called Fox 3, which was going to be a natural gas fired combined-cycle unit. And then as Gale mentioned in the script, essentially what the Commission said is : Well, all right, look at the resources at both of your Wisconsin utilities and tell us overall whether that unit is still needed. So, Julien, what we've been able to do to date, we've looked just simply at what I guess I would call the capacity demand balance between the two utilities. If we look solely at the capacity demand balance, my expectation would be that you can easily defer Fox unit 3 for a number of years. The analysis that we are doing to go in addition to that capacity and demand is a bit of an energy analysis, if you will. If you look at the energy mix of the two utilities, my expectation is that it will confirm the capacity demand balance and that the unit will be deferred. But that's what we're in the process of doing. And then as Gale mentioned in the third quarter we'll do a formal filing to the Wisconsin Commission along those lines. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And Julien, the Fox 3 was estimated to be about a $600 million capital investment, which again based on our preliminary look we believe can be deferred. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for all the color. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You are more than welcome. Good questions Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right, Greg. I want to give you a shot here. Are the Jets going to be above .500? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Based on the strength of schedule, I'm going to say yes. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Not necessarily based on the talent, on the team, but based on the strength of the schedule. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And any kind of playoff expectations, Greg? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Well, there's always hope. Jets are used to having a lot of that. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I hope it's a good season for you. How are you doing, Greg? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good. I just want to cut to the chase and just make sure I hear you clearly. Making all the adjustments you guys laid out, you were very articulate. We should expect you to still be inside the guidance range pre-Integrys. And then we should expect on a full run rate, merger-integrated basis for fiscal year 2016 that you will grow 6% to 8% earnings off that number? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That is correct. You've nailed it. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay, perfect. So you've taken into account everything that's going on including the one-time impact of this legacy asset sale. You think that everything in the stewpot, that's a number you can hit? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're certainly expecting to do so. But let me mention this one-time thing you mentioned about the one-time legacy asset sale. We have with the combined company like $29 billion of assets. I think every year, Greg, since I've been here we've had some type of asset sale. And remember we also have a real estate subsidiary that develops and sells property. So it's part of our ongoing, it's just part of what we do. And I would suspect you want us to do this, because it's part of maximizing the value of our assets. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No, completely understand. I just wanted to be clear on it. My second question is as we think about your cash flow profile, pro forma for the deal, still superior and differentiating factor about your investment thesis relative to almost any other utility, given the robust cash flow nature of the Power the Future assets. How should we think about the cash flow deployment priorities of the company as they are built into that 6% to 8%, going to 5% to 7%, expectation? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: In terms of the cash flow priorities, number 1 through 10 is obviously investing in infrastructure upgrades that are very much needed for customers across the four states. And as I mentioned at the EEI Fall Finance Conference, we'll give you a lot more granular detail particularly about our next three- to five-year capital investment program. But we see tremendous need and tremendous opportunity for the use of that cash flow to upgrade the electric and natural gas infrastructures in the region. So that's priority number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 for the cash flow. And then obviously we want to maintain the 65% to 70% target for dividend payouts. And if there's any cash left over, well, we've got three doors we can go through. One is debt reduction. One would be if we can find, legitimately, additional investment opportunities and additional infrastructure projects. And then the third would be where we were before, which is a share buyback. But I would hope that and really am very hopeful that there will be additional investment opportunities that are really needed and that we can put that cash to really good use through infrastructure upgrades. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. Just to be clear, are there any specific commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the current rating and the discussions you've had with the rating agencies on how you're going to manage the parent debt balance over the next few years? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Pat? I'll let Pat answer that. J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: What we talked about, Greg, was the reason we tranched the acquisition debt is that our expectation is that as each tranche matures or comes to its end, we will have sufficient cash flow to be able to not renew that tranche. So in other words we plan to take it out. In addition to that I might add that we're also looking at what I'm just going to call balance sheet cleanup or looking at some of the other debt that is sitting out there at the Holding Company and what opportunities we've got to clean some of that up as well. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Great, questions. Thank you, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you doing, Jonathan? Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You just reiterated the 65% to 75% dividend payout target, Gale. And you obviously bumped it a little bit more than you were committed to post the merger. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. We thought you would like that, Jonathan. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. My question is it looks like the payout of the midpoint of the 2016 guidance is going to be 63%. How soon do you want to get in the range? You've typically done December increases. How should we think about that range versus what you've just been discussing around investment priorities? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, it's a question we will continue to look at between now and the end of the year. But certainly in the relatively near term, we very much want to be at least in the bottom end of the 65% to 70% range. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Then what would push you I guess broadly as you look at the earnings for the quarter, into (39:27) to the higher end of that long-term growth rate? Do you have a line of sight on what kind of things we should be looking for you to announce? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Very good question. Let me frame the answer; if Pat or Allen would like to add, I would certainly welcome them to do so. Let me frame the answer for you. There is not one single thing that could pop us to the top end of the range on a permanent basis. But if you think about our business and where we're headed, there are several factors, the biggest of which would be increased investment opportunity or increased investment requirement that we build on time and on budget and get cost recovery for. That would be the single biggest thing. In between rate cases, if you have an economic pickup and there's stronger sales growth, there are a number of things that can happen in between rate periods. But the single biggest factor that could drive us to the top end would be additional investment opportunities in infrastructure upgrades. Pat, Allen, anything you would like to add? J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I got just a couple things I could throw in, Jonathan. I think Gale hit the main one, but other things I would think about would be opportunity sales that would help us on the fuel recovery, to the extent that our fleet is called more by the MISO. And the other would be hitting some, we talked about our ATC 10 year capital plan and the range it could be in. You are also familiar with our joint venture with Duke, the DATC. To the extent that some of those projects hit or we get to the top higher end of that capital plan, that would also help. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That's a good point, Pat. So it all comes down \u2013 well, it doesn't all, but a lot of it comes down to : are there additional investment opportunities as we go forward beyond the plan that we'll be pretty granular about with you at EEI in the fall. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. If I may, just on one other point, you talked about having filed with the ICC to tell them you're going to have a rethink around the main replacement program. Does that include some proposal for how to resolve the ongoing investigation? Or is that a separate issue? Any perspective on how we bring that to closure? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It's a very good question. Let me be clear about the ongoing dockets. There's one very helpful ongoing docket. And let me back up and explain that. The commission, before we got involved with the potential acquisition, the commission brought in an outside consulting group by the name of Liberty Consulting to basically do a review of the management, the physical on-the-ground management of the gas main replacement project. Liberty has come back with 95 specific recommendations, most of which are very practical and all of which we agree with. So what the commission has done is they've kept that docket open and they've asked us by September, early September, to file a transition plan that in part lays out how we plan to incorporate those recommendations into our management of the program. So, I think a lot of what you're asking about has a schedule and has a definite plan for resolution. But I view the Liberty Consulting report as very helpful and certainly I know the commission has a good bit of faith in the recommendations. The recommendations are very practical. They are recommendations that we would automatically have put into our transition plan anyway. And so I think that's the way, as we take a step back and re-look the entire project from soup to nuts, from scope to schedule, to logistics, we will be incorporating the Liberty audits along the way and Liberty will also have input along the way. So, again, a schedule and a date has been set for us telling the commission how we plan to incorporate the Liberty recommendations and I think that will go a long way, in addition to the expertise that we're going to bring to this project. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Michael. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Gale, congrats on the deal. Congrats on getting everything closed and rolling out new guidance. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: One question, though. I know you are starting from the base of a $2.72 midpoint for WEC standalone. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm just trying to put apples \u2013 I'm worried we are comparing apples and oranges here. Because Integrys has a large gas utility presence; that means it generates or delivers a decent amount of its annual earnings in the fourth quarter. And just are you thinking that the second half of this year that Integrys would actually have contributed to our EPS? Or would it have detracted from EPS from the original standalone entity? Because a lot will depend on what your starting point is and the starting point here is a little confusing. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, I'm glad you asked the question. Let us answer it very directly. First of all, yes, we're picking up a lot of gas, gas delivery companies. And yes, they generally have a pretty good fourth quarter. They also have a lousy third quarter simply because of lack of gas demand. But let's step back here. A couple factors. First of all, the financial logic for the acquisition was that an acquisition that we would want to make, like the Integrys acquisition, would add to our earnings per share growth in the first full calendar year after closing. So, that's 2016. So, I think the logical starting point is okay; well, what would you have done standalone 2015? What would your growth rate standalone have been 2016? And is this better than that? And the answer is yes, it's better than that. So, I think if it's making any sense to you, Michael, I think we're starting with the correct starting point. But I would like to add one other factor and that is in the second half of this year there will be significant accounting adjustments. A lot of accounting noise around the acquisition, as you even saw in our second quarter adjustments. So really the GAAP numbers for Integrys, the Integrys utilities for the second half of 2015 are really going to be irrelevant to the long-run earnings capability of Integrys utilities going forward. Does that help, Michael? Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It helps. Let me ask another follow-on question, and I can catch up with your IR team or Pat offline. When you think about how far you are in the process of evaluating things like synergy opportunities or other opportunities to benefit \u2013 I mean, merger has only been closed for not quite 30 days, actually right at 30 days. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: How early in the process do you think you are? And do you think there is upside to whatever it is you are assuming today in potential long run, multiyear benefits from the merger? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Very good question, Michael. Let me just say this. We are less than 30 days in. Right now we are very much on target in terms of our plan for follow-on integration. Everybody understands where they report. Everyone has budget targets for 2016. And we are in the process of working through every single functional area to determine where we go and what the shape of their organizations look like. So it's a little early to give you much more granular detail, but let me back up. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that our earlier thinking and information we've said publicly, there's nothing to indicate that that's off-track. I would expect that over the 10 years there will be a minimum of $1 billion of savings for Wisconsin customers alone in a combination of capital and operating costs. And that to me still stands as a good preliminary early estimate. So we'll keep working on it, but right now I feel very good about where we are. And let me back-up to your earlier question again. Remember the $2.72 that we're talking about as the base for 2015 is Wisconsin Energy standalone. So we're basically taking out either a positive or negative impact of Integrys utilities for the second half of the year, to give you a clean starting point, if you will that was basically the foundation for the logic of the acquisition. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. I appreciate the help, guys. I may follow up offline. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, Michael. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Gale. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Welcome, Jim. How are you? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I'm tired. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Tired? What, you've been listening to the Southern call too long? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yep, that's and I'm on an airplane back from Tokyo. Hey, I have a couple questions for you. I'm confused and I'm having a little translation issue. Can you translate how much the operating efficiencies mean on a dollar basis? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm sorry, one more time? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I tried to avoid the S word. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Have we translated how much the operating efficiencies mean on a dollar basis? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. You talk about robust operating efficiencies. What does that mean on a dollar basis? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That means basically getting to our allowed rates of return and staying there for 2016 and beyond. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. I get it, I get it. Second question, totally different is, with all the noise that's going on in the State of Illinois, can you talk about the legal precedent for changing conditions once a merger has been actually, you have an order and it has been consummated? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, generally in all past cases, for the Illinois Commerce Commission to change its order, there generally would need to be new facts or some demonstration of an error in the facts that form the basis for the merger order. In this case, none of us see new facts or errors in fact. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General's Office, CUB and the City of Chicago really didn't indicate in any way, shape, or form that there were any new facts or that there were any facts in error. So again we believe the Commission's decision was very sound, well thought through, and supported by a significant body of evidence. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And are you guys going to give out any 2015 consolidated guidance? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. Nope. I really think it's kind of meaningless, to be honest with you. And the accounting noise around the second half of 2015 with the adjustments, et cetera, I think it would just make your head swim. To me the most important thing is : are we delivering what we said we would from the acquisition, which is growth over and above our 4% to 6% standalone growth. And what was our basis for starting? And that's the 2015 midpoint of $2.72 a share standalone. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Well, then let me ask you this question. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: If you raise the number 6% to 8% 2016 versus standalone, what prevents you from going 6% to 8% in say, 2017 and beyond? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, what would prevent us from doing that? First of all we'd have to have a plan that we would be comfortable with that would produce a 6% to 8%. And at this point in time, 29 days in, this is what we feel comfortable with and what we believe we can deliver. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. So wait for EEI is what you're saying? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I wouldn't expect that you're going to see an earnings guidance change at EEI. What you will see, though, is much more granular detail on our capital spending plans that drive the earnings growth. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great, okay. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You are welcome Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Brian. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon. How are you today? Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good thanks. A lot of my questions were asked. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I've gotten you from bad the last time to good. Next time you will be wonderful and award-winning. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Right, right. Just real quickly, what is the upcoming general rate case strategy and timing for the Wisconsin utility subs? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Well, for Wisconsin Electric if you recall we just completed our rate case last December, so our rates with future looking test years are set for 2015 and 2016. So under the normal course with the Wisconsin Commission really liking its utilities to file for a case every two years, under the normal course we would file for Wisconsin Electric in the spring of 2016 for rates that would go into effect January 1 of 2017. So that is Wisconsin Electric. Same thing applies for Wisconsin Gas. For Wisconsin Public Service, they are actually in the midst of a rate case right now, and we would expect a rate case decision as usual from the Wisconsin Commission by November or December of this year. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hello, Andy, how are you? Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research : Wonderful and award-winning. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Rock 'n roll. You haven't seen the lion down there, have you? Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research : No, not yet. We are in Chicago so he hasn't come down our way yet. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Well be careful. Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research : Just a real quick maintenance question. In terms of rate case earnings benefits in the latter half of the year, should they be similar to the $24 million in the first half? Or first quarter was a little bit higher than the second quarter? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: In terms of the Wisconsin Electric rate case benefits, guys, no? Okay, Steve, we will ask you to cover that. Stephen P. Dickson - VP & Controller, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So you are referring during the earnings package we've got for the quarter rate case netted to $9.5 million. And what that represents is going into the rate case last year when the rates were set effective January 1, the Wisconsin Commission assumed a certain level of SSR revenues. And what has happened is that the SSR, we reached an agreement with the State of Michigan and those stopped. But in the Wisconsin rate case we are allowed to have the incremental revenues associated with that. So if you remember last year in the SSRs, the first half of the year the SSRs were based on the suspension. And then later in the year it went to the retirement SSRs. And so the dollar amount was greater in the latter part of the year. So the short answer is you will not see this big a benefit in the last part of the year, but you'll see a little bit of benefit. Does that make sense? Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research : Yeah, I think so. I might follow-up off-line, but that's all I had. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Greetings, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Greetings, Gale. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We are good. We'd like it a little hotter, a little more humid, but we are good. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I will work on that. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: What's the rate base at Peoples Gas? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm sorry, one more time with the question? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: What is rate base at Peoples Gas? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Rate base at Peoples Gas? I'm looking at Pat. I think it's $1.8 billion. J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And about a 50-50 cap structure? J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes, that is correct. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Then just to make sure I understand it, combined 2016 earnings should be 6% to 8% growth off of standalone $2.72? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You've got it. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Those were all my questions. Thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're more than welcome. J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Last but not least, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : How you doing? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : All right. You mentioned that there were going to be some substantial accounting adjustments in the second half of the year. I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a preview what you are expecting to happen there? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. And I will ask Steve Dickson, our controller, and Scott Lauber, our treasurer, if they have anything to add. But essentially as you know, in any acquisition \u2013 we're not immune from this \u2013 one of the things that has to be done is purchase price adjustments. Generally you get a year to do that. But when you close this early in the year the SEC would like you to button down many of the purchase price adjustments of the time of the filing of the 10-K, which would be early, early next year. So one of the major amount of accounting work that has to be done is all the purchase price adjustment work. Then I'm certain there will be some one-time transition type costs, and there's a whole slew of different types of costs that would be one-time costs that we would incur in the second half of this year. For example, we want to get an improvement in call center responsiveness for a number of the Integrys utilities; there will be some one-time costs to that. Pat tells me that there are software licensing costs that we will incur that would be one-time nonrecurring in the second half of this year. We could go on with a list of 30 or 40 of these things that are all transition costs that would be non-recurring. But that gives you a flavor. Steve, would you like to add anything? Stephen P. Dickson - VP & Controller, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'll add, I think you nailed the transition related costs. And I'll go back to the previous question, is we will report GAAP costs at the end of the year; but then as Pat mentioned, we're going to strip out. We're going to make an accounting adjustment to strip off the Integ (58:22) earnings, we're going to strip off the acquisition debt, we're going to strip off the additional shares associated with that to get back to the WEC standalone. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Just to follow-up on this, though, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of charges. Do we have any sense as to what the quantity of those one-timers is going to be? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Not yet. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We'll certainly have a much better feel for that when we see you at the EEI Conference, but not yet. We are, again, 29 days into this. We know there will probably be a number of charges, and we will be working on it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Then in terms of purchase accounting, sometimes that has an impact going forward, and some companies strip out those impacts depending on how they are, and sometimes they aren't. Do you guys have any feel as to how the purchase accounting might affect growth going forward? And is there any impact associated with purchase accounting that's in your 2016 and beyond expectations for earnings growth? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, first of all, I don't think we know the answer to that completely yet. But there is one element, because we have regulated operations and more than 99% of our earnings are coming from regulated operations, but in general terms when you value regulated assets they come over onto your balance sheet at carrying value, at rate based value, if I'm making any sense to you. So that actually simplifies a great deal the purchase accounting. However, there are other things that we have to take a hard look at, like the value of some of the solar assets that Integrys has retained; like the value of a company called Trillium, which is a compressed natural gas fueling station company. So there are other assets. I think there's a waste-to-energy plant in Texas that they had. There are several of these assets that we're going to have to take a hard look at and give an appropriate value to. But in terms of major impact on 2016 earnings growth and beyond, Steve, I don't see any, do you? Stephen P. Dickson - VP & Controller, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, you nailed it. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : No, I would've thought it until you guys brought it up. And I mean, I think it probably would have been different if Integrys had kept the retail business. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Oh, gosh, very different, very different. Remember, that was part of the announcement, that that did not fit with our model going forward. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Right. So just to make sure I understand, basically your earnings growth doesn't have really any major assumptions associated with purchase accounting one way or the other in it? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You are correct. You are absolutely correct. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Thanks a lot. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any questions, now we have both Colleen and Beth and they are available in our Investor Relations office, 414-221-2592. Thanks everybody.",

Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call to review the 2015 Third Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for the third quarter. This, of course, is our first full quarter as a newly combined company. We formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. I'll update you on our progress as a new company in just a moment. But first as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President for Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. We also have one new member of our senior team with us today, Bill Guc. Bill is our new Vice President and Controller. He has more than 20 years of solid experience in our industry. Prior to the acquisition, he served as Treasurer of Integrys. Bill, welcome aboard. Turning now to the third quarter, and I'd like to remind you that we're reporting our legacy Wisconsin Energy results only through the remainder of 2015. So the financial results and the guidance that we'll be discussing have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. Pat will review our results in detail in just a few minutes. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $0.61 a share for the third quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. We delivered strong results through an unusual pattern of summer weather, a cool July, a cool August, followed by an unseasonably warm September. Taking a quick look at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in September, well below the national average and the lowest rate of unemployment we've seen here since back in April of 2001. And in the latest survey of the climate for business, Wisconsin was ranked the 12th best state for business by Chief Executive Magazine. This ranking represents a huge leap forward since 2010, when the state came in at 41st. In this year's third quarter, residential use of electricity surged by 11.5% compared to last year's abnormally cool summer. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment grew slightly with electricity use rising by 1.6% over the third quarter of a year ago. And deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines rose by 0.6% in the quarter. Several sectors continued to show strength including food processing, printing and to Mrs. Robinson (4:12), plastics. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving 6,000 more electric customers and 10,000 more natural gas customers today than we were a year ago. Now, I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighed it against our three important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. And after considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all three criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. And, of course, over the past year, a number of similar deals have been announced, several as you know, in just the past few months. We're pleased that the metrics for our transaction compare very favorably to these recent announcements. We also see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we'll incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline the operations and reduce costs. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America and one of the 15th largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with significant opportunities for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. Now, let's touch on some of the key financial measures for the new company. For starters, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt was 2.21% annually, an outstanding result and clearly lower than we had expected. So, for 2016, we now project growth in earnings per share for the combined company to be in the range of 6% to 8%. 6% to 8% earnings growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy standalone delivers earnings of $2.72 a share this year. For the longer term, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. And on the subject of infrastructure upgrades, you may recall that we originally projected capital spending for the combined company in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year for the remainder of the decade and actually beyond. Now, about 120 days into the company, as we look at the spectrum of projects that need to be addressed to deliver industry-leading reliability, we're seeing even stronger investment opportunities. And in the latter part of the decade, our capital investments could range above $1.5 billion a year. With the few other minor changes to our estimates, we continue to project longer term earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% a year range and we're comfortable at the midpoint of that range. Lastly, a reminder about our dividend policy. In June, our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. You may recall this was our second dividend increase during 2015. In total, we've raised the dividend by 17.3% this year. Going forward, we're targeting as you may have heard us say a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Looking forward, we expect to return to our normal pattern of dividend action. Management typically brings the dividend proposal to the board in January of each year and we would expect to do so in January of 2016. Now, I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing some of our operational highlights in the past quarter. First, I'm pleased to report that just two weeks ago We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth year in a row. And in recent national studies of large utility systems, We Energies is ranked in the top quartile of the Midwest for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was ranked number two in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. We're also making progress on the Accelerated Main Replacement Project at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you recall, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines over the next 20 years. Some of those pipes ladies and gentlemen literally date back to the days of Abraham Lincoln. One of our most immediate and important goals is to improve the management and the performance of this project. Since we closed the acquisition, we put in place an entirely new senior leadership team at Peoples, and we built an in-house construction management group with extensive project experience. They determined that the best approach for the Main Replacement program in Chicago is a fresh start. So over the past 100 days, we've transitioned the management of the project from an outside contractor to our experienced in-house team. We've also engaged a nationally known firm to help us conduct an independent review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. We expect to submit this review and our recommendations to the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of November. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicagoans will have a safe, modern, natural gas delivery system that they deserve. Then on the natural gas distribution side of our business in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to announce that our West Central Gas pipeline project is now complete and, as of November 1, in service. This was the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in company history. 85-mile line addresses reliability concerns and allows us to add a significant number of customers in the areas where propane use is the heaviest. The project came in on time and actually better than budget at just under $130 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. On the power generation side of our business, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year in fuel cost, depending on the blend. We're working now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site and the first capital improvements inside the plant began in September during a planned outage for one of the two units. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of next year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas is now more than 97% complete with only tuning and just punch list items remaining for the project. So our conversion costs will be $60 million to $62 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the work at the Valley Plant on time and on budget within the next 30 days. We also continue to make good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity that will meet current federal standards. Overall, the project is on time and on budget with approximately 60% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of 2016 and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant investment opportunities as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. We plan to provide you, as we promised, with more details on our capital investment plans for the next 10 years at the EEI Conference in just a few days. Turning to our transmission business, WEC Energy Group, I would remind you, is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. And as you may have seen, ATC recently updated its 10-year capital plan. The plan has slightly lower growth in the near term, but it calls for ATC to invest $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. This latest projection is up from the previous 10-year plan. That previous plan, as you recall, had an investment ranging from $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. On a final note, we've completed our evaluation of the compressed natural gas business that we inherited with the acquisition of Integrys. That business is known as Trillium CNG. We've determined that the enterprise has value, but does not fit our focus on our core regulated business. As a result, we're now seeking a new owner for Trillium. So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times, filled with opportunity for our company, and we believe we have a very bright future ahead. Now, for more details on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat? J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 third quarter Wisconsin Energy standalone adjusted earnings were $0.61 a share. That compares to adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year's third quarter, my discussion of results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys company and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. We will continue this practice for the remainder of 2015. First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Third quarter adjusted consolidated operating income was $262.2 million as compared with adjusted income of $249.1 million in 2014. That's an improvement of $13.1 million. Starting with Utility Energy, adjusted operating income in the third quarter totaled $168.5 million for 2015, an improvement of $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, weather helped our earnings by $27.6 million. We had a warmer than normal September in 2015 and a very cool third quarter in 2014. We were also helped by $12 million of improved fuel recoveries and $10.1 million from the impact of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $36 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefits costs. And we also saw increased depreciation expense of $3.6 million associated with higher capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $10.1 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter last year. Our non-utility operating income was $93.2 million, which is $1.2 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our adjusted corporate and other improved slightly by $1.8 million over the previous year. Taking these changes together, you arrive at Wisconsin Energy's third quarter adjusted operating income of $262.2 million. This is a $13.1 million improvement over the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of this year, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $17.6 million, a decline of $400,000 compared to the same period in the prior year. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. These earnings only reflect Wisconsin Energy's standalone share of ATC's results. Other income net increased by $900,000, driven by higher AFUDC, and our adjusted net interest expense increased by $700,000, primarily because of higher utility debt levels. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $4 million for the quarter. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for the calendar year will be between 37% and 38%. WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% for 2015. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $138.2 million, or $0.61 a share for the third quarter of 2015. Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group exclusively on a GAAP basis and, thus, this includes three months of result from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During the first nine months of 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flow totaled $1.073 billion, which is a $39 million improvement over the first nine months of 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $100 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2015 is 50.3%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of the WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. For comparison purposes, the sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual third quarter retail deliveries rose by 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries increased by 4.4%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding iron ore mines, were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries rise by 1.4%, and as Gale mentioned, actual residential deliveries rose by 11.5%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries fell by 0.7%. Actual deliveries rose by 1.6%. And in the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2015 fell by 8.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries rose by 0.6%. Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation dropped 0.4% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation were down 6.7% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year. Moving to other items of interest. In September of 2015, Wisconsin Gas issued a $200 million, 10-year bond at a coupon of 3.53%. In part, this new bond is replacing $125 million bond with a coupon of 5.2% that comes due in December. Turning now to our 2015 earnings forecast. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to guide based on adjusted standalone earnings for Wisconsin Energy. And again, for your reference, adjusted earnings exclude the results of Integrys, exclude the impacts of the acquisition and adjust for the additional shares that were issued as part of the acquisition. Wisconsin Energy's adjusted earnings through the third quarter are $2.10 per share. Taking into account the impact of a relatively warm October as we enter the heating season and assuming normal weather for the rest of the quarter, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. Thus, the 2015 adjusted earnings forecast for Wisconsin Energy is $2.72 a share. At $2.72, Wisconsin Energy's regulated utilities will earn at or near their allowed rates of return. So again, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2016. As Gale mentioned, we forecast earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 6% to 8% off a projected base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in the range from $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Terrific. Pat, thank you. Overall, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : And now we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jonathan. How are you today? Well, Jonathan, I know it's tough. J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Or muted. Operator : And Jonathan, please make sure your line is not on mute. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First-time caller, long-time listener I think. All right. Why don't we go to the next call? Operator : Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : How's your mute button, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. I'm still here. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good. How are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Quite well. Thank you. Perhaps just to kick off the conversation, the comment on the latter part of the decade, around the $1.5 billion, could you, one, elaborate around what would be driving that? What would the investment be? Where would it be oriented? And then also confirm for us, would that require equity or is the balance sheet in a sufficient place to deal with the incremental capital? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, let me just reiterate, no expectation of additional equity, period. And then, in terms of the types of projects that we're seeing, we'll give you some really granular detail at the EEI Conference on the 10-year capital spending and on the uptick that we're seeing in the latter part of the decade. But let me just say, in general, we're seeing additional requirements, additional capital spending for upgrades and expansion particularly with natural gas in Wisconsin, and for that matter, in Minnesota. So, they're really infrastructure projects; they're the kinds of things we have been talking about. But as we looked across \u2013 as I mentioned, across the spectrum of projects now with the new combined company, we're really seeing infrastructure needs that are going to drive the capital spending higher. Now, if you recall, as we made the acquisition, we indicated that we would \u2013 our number one priority, if there were legitimate needed projects, would be to deploy some of our positive free cash flow to that type of investment. So, basically, what we're saying is that over the course of the last 120 days, as we've really refined our estimates and looked at the spectrum of projects, we're seeing higher capital spend out in those years, largely delivery networks, a lot of it gas. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Excellent. And then, let me cut back, and I know this is a little preempting next week a bit, but you talk about the fresh start, to use your words, does that impact the timing of the CapEx on the people side of the business, and perhaps what drove you to come to that conclusion? Can you elaborate a little bit on what exactly that means? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The answer is certainly for this year and for the near term, I wouldn't expect any change in the capital projections for Peoples Gas. And from the standpoint \u2013 and let me explain. There are only so many streets you can dig up in Chicago at one time. So in essence, we are physically limited as to how much progress you can make in any given year in terms of the gas-main replacement program of those 2,000 miles of pipes under the streets of Chicago. So that \u2013 I mean, there's a governing factor that is driven mostly by just the physical capability of how many streets can you dig up and repair. That's number one. Number two, related to the fresh start, I mean, as you may recall, there was a Commission-mandated audit of the management of the program. It was a rather critical audit. The prior management had outsourced the management of this project, and we really felt like bringing in an experienced construction management team was very important to the future of the project and to managing that project well. And that team has looked at the project controls and all of the other issues that they found, and that's why we've decided to go back with a fresh start, with a whole new bottoms-up analysis, and you will see when we file publicly on November 30 what our long-term cost projections are and what our immediate priorities will be. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Thank you all. See you soon. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look forward to it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : How are you doing, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I'm good. How are you, Gale? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're good. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, I'm looking for some Bucks tickets. Know anyone who could get me some? Okay. On to more important topics. First thing, besides the Bucks, Trillium book value and the tax basis and what your expected uses of proceeds are? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We'll talk to Allen about that, but I believe the book value is around $130 million. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. That's basically similar? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it's probably three-quarters of that. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Switching over to cash flow, I'm not trying to become a debt analyst, but the \u2013 and you guys over the years have been very helpful with earnings guidance and dividend expectations, but less so on the cash flow side of things. So when you look at your FFO productions, can you just book-end how much of that FFO comes from, say, Power the Future, and then if you add in Illinois, relative to the total FFO amount? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Jim, we don't have that kind of detail in the room with us today. I mean, we can... James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We can, off line, kind of give you some broad estimates, but we just don't have \u2013 I mean, we want to give you the right kind of answers. We just don't have that specificity in the room with us today. The entire brain thrust is here, but we don't have that kind of specificity. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then are you seeing any \u2013 well, we'll talk about that offline. But as a follow-up to that, are you seeing any calls on your cash in the near term to intermediate term? Intermediate being defined as, say, two years to three years. This year, you did your pension contribution for the first time. Is there any changes with respect to like deferred taxes and the like? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, obviously, the short answer is no. However, there's going to be a lot of developments particularly towards the end of the year, and specifically related to whether or not Congress renews or extends bonus depreciation. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Right. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : For many companies including ours, that's a very big number. Now, from a cash standpoint, we have not factored in the potential uptick of bonus appreciation, again, from a cash standpoint in 2016 or beyond. We're just very conservative from that standpoint. We're not going to make any assumptions until we see the legislation actually signed and in place. But those are very \u2013 those could be \u2013 that could be a very big swing. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: No, I get it. Okay. And then the last question still on this debt analyst path, fixed debt versus variable debt. If I did my math correctly on the combined entity, the debt is basically entirely fixed that you have. I think there's a few resets that switch over to variable in the next three years to five years. But nothing really to get worked up about in the event that Fed finally decides to start moving rates. Is that correct? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, gosh, yeah. I mean, the lion's share of our debt is absolutely fixed. You are correct. There are a couple of hybrid issuances, one at legacy WEC, one at Integrys, that could switch over in 2017 and 2016, 2017 for us, 2017 for legacy WEC, 2016 for Integrys that could switch over. But they switch over even if the Fed raised rates a little at incredibly low levels, like LIBOR plus 2.12%. I mean, so they're very competitive, if they do \u2013 when they do switch over. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Super. That's all I had. Thanks, guys. See you in Florida. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look forward to it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Jonathan. Did that mute button sick? Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: There's some rumor I might have fallen asleep here. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We were that scintillating in the call, huh? Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I thought I needed to refute that. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : How are you doing, Jonathan, other than those naps are wonderful. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. So, one \u2013 just a couple of small things, your O&M, as we think about pro forma and where it came in, in the quarter. Is $500 million a quarter a decent run rate expectation, just as we're wrestling with the pro forma model? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're looking at each other here. It's within the ballpark, maybe a hair high, but it's within the ballpark. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then, we have one other. Just as we think about TEG in fourth quarter and try unfolding that in, we're likely to see a dilution in Q4, or possibly accretion given the winter waiting? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, I wouldn't think you'd see dilution in Q4, but remember, one of the reasons why, Jonathan, we're focusing on legacy WEC performance for the remainder of the year is there are \u2013 as we go through purchase price accounting, as we go through transition costs, as we go through any remaining acquisition costs, which should be very small at this point, there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of one-time things that affect the Integrys performance financially from a reporting standpoint in the fourth quarter. So, again, we think it's almost fruitless to try to give you a GAAP number, and to concentrate on the GAAP number for the Integrys performance in the fourth quarter. Having said that, January 1, 2016 is combined company rock and roll. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, from 2016, you're going to give \u2013 you're not going to keep doing this through the year after the close or anything like that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely not. You will see combined results. That's what we will focus on. That's what we report. And Jonathan, that's what our earnings guidance that Pat just gave you for 2016 is based on. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much, and thanks for the insights. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome, Jonathan. J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : (35:14). Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey. How are you doing? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're great. How about you, Paul? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm managing... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Now, the last time I asked about wonderful and award-winning, and you weren't quite there. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well, I'm always striving. Always striving (35:34). Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Okay. We'll try to be helpful. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I want to turn to the accelerated main replacement program in Illinois. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So now it looks like the projections are that it'll be considerably more CapEx, I would assume. Could you give us a flavor for how much we should be seeing annually that being driven by and just sort of the causation that we're seeing there and also the rate impact, I guess, cumulatively over this period of time? I mean, it just seems like a lot that we're reading about. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. And I appreciate you're asking the question. Let me clarify two or three very key points here. First of all, this was designed initially to be a 20-year program. When we walked into the door after the acquisition, there had been an estimate, a revised estimate made by the previous outsourced firm that the cost might rise to as much as, say, $8 billion over the 20-year period. I don't think the previous management had confidence in that estimate. We did not have confidence in that estimate. That's why we brought in our experienced team and another outside nationally known firm to basically take a complete bottoms-up review. Having said that, the legislation that enables this program to move forward with current and appropriate cost recovery caps the amount of capital spending on this program at roughly $250 million a year. From what I have seen personally over the last 120 days, it would be extremely difficult. I mentioned earlier there are only so many streets you can dig up, and you can't do a lot of this work in the dead of winter. So, from a weather standpoint and just a sheer congestion and major city standpoint, I don't think you could technically just physically spend much more than about $250 million a year anyway. So, I wouldn't make the assumption. I think it'd be an inappropriate assumption that we would be spending much more on that advanced main replacement program in any given year than $250 million to $300 million. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Does that help, Paul? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : It does help. And I guess in terms of that $8 billion number which clearly you guys are reviewing, I mean, when do you think we're going to get or when will you guys get a better idea about what the \u2013 would you be able to share with us what you think the actual number will be? And I'm just wondering, I mean, you talk about digging up streets and stuff. I mean, there are some things that you hear about and which you could do things without digging up the street, if you follow me, in terms of like liner or stuff and what have you, I don't know. I'm just wondering whether or not... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're going to try fracking down there. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well, that will solve some transportation issues. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That'll solve the problem, exactly. I mean, there are \u2013 there's something called keyhole technology which we are experimenting with right now. But having said that, just the sheer logistics, I would still believe that given the weather constraints and the sheer logistics, we're probably physically capped at the $250 million to $300 million a year. Now, you asked, when are we going to see more specific estimates? Well, the date is November 30. We've promised the Illinois Commerce Commission that we will file on November 30, our longer-term cost estimates for the 20-year period. Now, as you know, trying to estimate precisely the cost of the construction program that is going to span 20 years, you know the only thing we're going to be is wrong. So, we will probably give a range of values. We'll probably have a low case, a medium case, and a high case. And then I would expect that what we will really focus on is, okay, those are projections but what are we going to do in the next three years to make the most progress in getting that natural gas delivery system as safe and efficient as possible? I think you'll see a broad range for a lengthy period of time, so low case, high case, medium case. And then we will really focus on what we plan to do in the next three years and what the cost of that is, and what the progress will be. And all of that look forward to November 30. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Now in terms of rate impact, and I think \u2013 I'm glad you asked that question. The legislation basically caps at that $250 million to $300 million a year. Caps consumer rate increases at an average of 4%. But it's very important to understand what that 4% is based on. That 4% is based on what we call base rates. So, base rates make up like less than a third of a residential customer's gas bill. The rest is the commodity. So we're not talking about tremendous rate pressure here. We're talking about 4% off of \u2013 we're talking about basically 4% on a third of the total customer bill each year. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then I guess just, when you say the 20 years, I mean this project's been going on for some time. I mean... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Not really. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : ...or it hasn't? Because I mean, so we're not talking 2030, or are we talking \u2013 what is the date and time we're talking about I guess? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Officially, I mean there was some work done I think in 2012 and 2013, but basically under the legislation, really March 2014. I think that the hope was that a lot could be accomplished by 2030. Again, we're taking a hard, fresh bottoms-up look at this, but we're talking about a very extensive period of time. And the one thing \u2013 and I've spent a lot of time personally in Chicago with the team over the last couple of months, and the one thing that is very clear to me is that from the Mayor's office to the common council to the Illinois Commerce Commission, there is outstanding and common agreement that this program has to move forward. It has to be done efficiently. It has to be managed well, but Chicago has to have the modern efficient system that it deserves. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're more than welcome, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rock and roll, Michael. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Gale. Congrats on a good quarter. Real quickly, just when you think about transmission spend and the CapEx change at ATC, can you frame how much of the near-term, meaning the next two to three years, has changed relative to what was prior \u2013 previously in the public domain? J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : There's very little change. I mean, when you look at 10-year plan to 10-year plan, Michael, there's really very little change in the frontend. I'm sure you've seen these \u2013 if you look at the 10-year estimates, the previous estimates were in the range of $3.3 million to $3.9 million. The new estimates are in the range of $3.7 million to $4.5 million. So over a 10-year period, they're talking about somewhat more capital spending. But in the very short term, which I think was the source of your question, two years to three years, not seeing a heck of a lot of change, which is kind of what you would expect, because these projects take a long time to get approved and then they're typically multi-year in nature. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And when you think about the next two to three, three to four years at ATC, how much of those projects have already received siting, already received permitting, are kind of close to shovel-ready or are virtually shovel-ready now? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Well, I would say anything two years out is virtually... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Done, yeah. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: ...is already \u2013 you've gone through the approvals, because again going back to what I said, the projects are typically multi-year. And then as you get farther and farther out obviously, less and less would already have gone through the regulatory process. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Allen is exactly right. If you think about the gestation period on some of these larger projects, they can be \u2013 from conceptual, design to approval, they could be five years. So, I think you could clearly conclude what Allen is saying that the next couple of two, three years, virtually everything they've included is largely through the approval process. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And when you're looking at demand on the gas utility side, how different do you see demand, or how much do you expect demand to differ in Wisconsin relative to Illinois and some of the other Integrys service areas? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would expect, given normal weather conditions, demand in Wisconsin and Minnesota and, to some extent, Michigan to grow more strongly than Illinois simply because there's just not a lot of propane use in the City of Illinois. By contrast, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota are three of the 10 heaviest using \u2013 heaviest propane using states in the U.S. And, for example, in Minnesota, recently, there was legislation passed that in essence reduces the upfront hook-up cost for customers to switch over to the natural gas delivery network that allows more of those capital costs to be basically put into rate base as opposed to the individual customer having to pay more or hooking into the system, and that was done because of the very significant concern in Minnesota about what happened in 2014 during the polar vortex with propane supplies. So, we would expect Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, in terms of gas demand and growth in gas customers, to be stronger. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. See you in Florida, Michael. Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sounds great. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Paul. How are you today? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Well, Gale. Yourself? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're doing well. (46:04). Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Oh, yeah. You got me, I'm not going to go there, okay? Now, that you've had kind of a few months to digest the transaction, can you kind of give us an update on maybe what you're seeing as potential synergy opportunities? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me start by saying that we really have not had any major negative surprises. Essentially, I think we did a good job of due diligence in what we're seeing in terms of the best practices, in terms of driving costs down, in terms of more efficient operations. I think all the potential we saw is really there. So, I would first say the one upside for the past 120 days is the clear identification of infrastructure upgrades beyond what we thought in our due diligence and that led to what I discussed about the higher capital spending on rate base opportunities here in the latter part of the decade. In terms of cost reductions, remember this transaction was far more about growth than about cost reductions. The cost reductions we have estimated basically will be needed in any given year to help us make sure we earn our allowed rates of return. So, again, I don't want to make \u2013 I want to make sure that no one is thinking that there are going to be huge cost savings that are then going to somehow result in earnings above the allowed rates of return. That's not the plan, and that's not what we're seeing. I will say this, though, I think long term, there will be significant and tangible savings. There's no question about that. And even in Wisconsin, let me reiterate what we said earlier, and that is over the next 10 years, I see in a combination of capital cost savings and O&M savings, at least $1 billion of cost savings. Again, that's a combination of capital and O&M. And the first tangible result of that was when we were able to \u2013 with the Commission's approval, we were able to take off the table the need for Wisconsin Public Service to build a Fox 3, which was a combined cycle natural gas unit that had been planned. And that's a $600 million investment that we can postpone for a very long time. So that's a tangible savings for customers right there. We will see, over time, for example, in just having to build only one, and it's being built by Integrys right now, only one new major customer information and billing system, the project is called ICE, and those projects are about $120 million, $150 million a pop. Well, we're only going to need to build one of them, and that's being built right now. So, you can see all across our operations how we can drive cost savings over time. I hope that responds to your question. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: It does. And can you \u2013 for a while, it seemed as though mining frac sand had some upside to it. What's the status of that industry? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have about 110 frac sand, mining or processing operations in the Western part of Wisconsin. That is up from literally 10, five years ago. So that industry literally has just burgeoned over the course of the past five years, 10 to 110. Now, those 110 operations because of the price of oil, and lesser demand for frac sand, those operations are down. I think we're seeing about \u2013 of those we are serving today with natural gas, about an 11% decline this year in their natural gas demand. However, we were not serving anywhere near all of those 110 operations because we didn't have the infrastructure backbone to support that. I mentioned earlier, that our West Central Gas expansion project is now complete; that 85-mile line. That will allow us to sign up more of those operations. So, we're going to see growth in the therms that we deliver to that industry in Western Wisconsin over time, simply because we weren't serving that many of them during the boom times. As I said, they are down about 11% in terms of therms now, but we're going to be serving more of them, now that we have completed the West Central line. In fact, one of the major frac sand operators has just signed a contract with us to switch over from propane to natural gas. And remember, the ones we're not serving now are basically drying their sand with propane and their preference would be to move to less costly, more predictable natural gas. Does that respond to your question? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Perfectly. And then, lastly, just on the fresh look on main replacement, which way do you think that $8 billion number goes? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : When we have a firm number and file it on November 30, you'll be the first to know. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I look forward to your call. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Terrific. Thank you very much. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you again for taking part. If you have any other questions, please feel free call to Colleen Henderson or Beth Straka and the direct line to call is 414-221-2592.

In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Helane, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2015. As you know, we formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. So today's report reflects two full quarters as a combined company. I'll update our progress on a number of major initiatives in just a moment. But first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group and CEO-elect; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Turning now to our 2015 performance, I'd like to remind you that we're focusing on legacy Wisconsin Energy so our financial results have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. And as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $2.73 a share for 2015, that compares with adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. Looking back over the latest year, it was not only a transformational year for our company but a year also of significant achievements. We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year. In international studies, We Energies ranked in the top quartile in the Midwest again for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay was ranked number two in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among mid-sized utilities. We also reached a milestone for employee safety at We Energies, recording the safest year in more than 115 years of operation. We invested nearly $780 million in our legacy core business with all major projects on time and on budget. And, of course, we closed our acquisition of Integrys to form WEC Energy Group, the leading electric and natural gas utility system in the Midwest with now 4.4 million customers across the region. From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. Through disciplined cost control and effective planning, we delivered record earnings in 2015 despite a very warm fourth quarter. In fact, Milwaukee experienced the warmest December in its history, surpassing the former record set way back in the day in 1877. Taking a look at the state's economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate ended the year at 4.3%, well below the national average and the December statistics show that more Wisconsinites were employed than during any other month in history. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68%, which is more than 5 points better than the national rates. In addition, Wisconsin added 4,000 manufacturing jobs from November 2014 to November of 2015 despite some very challenging conditions for manufacturers. In light of these challenges, use of electricity by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. In 2015, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 0.4% less electricity than they did in 2014. However, and this is an important point, we did see improvement in several significant sectors of the state's economy including food processing, printing, paper production and plastics. In addition, we continued to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and more than 8,500 more customers on the gas side of our business today than we were a year ago. I'm also pleased with our post-acquisition work over the past several months as we've begun to operationalize the new WEC Energy Group. As I've said before, we see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach, and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We're leveraging these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders. And with our proven leadership team, we're incorporating best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and to reduce costs. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with real opportunity for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest and our plan calls for the combined company to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% in 2016. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact of bonus depreciation, a subject I know you're very interested in. As you know, in December, Congress passed a tax law that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we'll receive approximately $1 billion of cash benefits from this extension of bonus depreciation, with most of the benefits coming in 2016 and in 2017. First, let me say though, that we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any material impact on earnings this year. And over the longer term we have significant flexibility to bring forward reliability projects that will clearly benefit customers. The additional cash benefits will allow us to fund a strong backlog of infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability. And if the Clean Power plan moves forward on the proposed timetable, our incremental cash flows could well be needed to support additional investments in renewable energy or new natural gas generation for our fleet. Of course, we also have the option to further deleverage the holding company. So bottom line, for the longer term, beyond 2016, we continue to see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% a year. As a reminder, our current 10-year investment plan is primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We expect that more than half of our capital investments, about $800 million a year roughly, will be dedicated to the gas delivery business, providing safer and more reliable infrastructure and extending our gas distribution lines to customers across the Midwest. We also plan to invest approximately $400 million a year to upgrade and harden our electric delivery networks. Now, the primary risks associated with these core distribution projects are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the work. But the work is no less important than the mega projects we've completed over the years. Our focus now on renewing our distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as one of the nation's most reliable utilities. We also expect the remaining investment, approximately $300 million a year, will be focused on our generating fleet and on what we call corporate infrastructure. To be clear, however, these projections did not include any capital that would be needed for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. Turning now to other developments, I'm pleased to report that the conversion of the Valley Power Plant near Downtown Milwaukee from coal to natural gas was completed in the fourth quarter on time and on budget. The total investment was approximately $60 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We're also making very good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Overall, the Twin Falls project is on time and on budget with approximately 82% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of this year, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Next, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibilities at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. But given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save customers anywhere between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending upon the mix. Work is under way now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site. The larger site should be ready by early next year. Also, the first capital investment inside the plant was made on one of the units during a planned outage this past fall. We also plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of this year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We're also moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you'll recall, this is one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines and I'm pleased to report that over the past six months, we've taken significant steps to improve the management and performance of this project, which is now approximately 18% complete. We engaged a nationally recognized engineering firm that helped us conduct an extensive independent review of the work plan and the long-term cost estimates. And as part of our fresh start in Chicago, we filed a plan on November 30 that lays out our top priorities for the next three years. The components of the three-year plan include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, a projected investment of between $250 million and $280 million a year, and regular updates to the Illinois Commerce Commission and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed of our progress. In assessing the plan that we filed on November 30, the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled a series of six workshops to be held by the end of March. Two of the workshops are already complete. While the engineering, fieldwork and cost recovery continue, these workshops are bringing together all of the stakeholders to review the scope, the schedule and the long-term cost of the plan with a focus on safety and reliability. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will provide Chicagoans with a safe modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. Moving now to our transmission business, our electric transmission business, as you know, WEC is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. ATC's capital plan calls for investment of $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. Turning now to our dividend policy, on January 21, as you may have read, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate is now $1.98 a share. Going forward, we're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. On a final note, as I mentioned on one of our previous calls, we've been seeking a new owner for the Trillium compressed natural gas business. You'll recall that this business came to us as part of the Integrys transaction. We sold part of the business in late November of last year, and very recently, we reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining Trillium assets. This agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we're projecting to reach financial close by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect at least $130 million of pre-tax cash proceeds from the combined sales of the Trillium assets. The fair value of Trillium was reflected in our purchase price allocation following the Integrys acquisition and as you know, the earnings on the Trillium business were not significant to our company. So, in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity and change for our company. And speaking of change, we recently announced that I'll be retiring as Chief Executive Officer effective May 1. After May 1, I'll continue to serve the company as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and I'm delighted that Allen Leverett will succeed me as Chief Executive. Allen has also been appointed to our board of directors. As most of you know, Allen has been a very key contributor to our success since he joined Wisconsin Energy the same year I did back in 2003, first as Chief Financial Officer, then as the leader of our power generation group and most recently as President of the parent firm at our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan utilities. I've known and worked with Allen for more than 20 years. Now, I have to tell you he is not quite as fond of breed of financial audit as I am, but the depth of his experience, his management skills and his focus on execution make him the ideal person to lead our company through a time of continuing change in the energy industry. Allen, my congratulations. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Thank you, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And now for more details on our 2015 performance and our outlook for 2016, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, in 2015, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.73 compared with $2.65 a share for 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year, my discussion of 2015 results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2015 was $1.137 billion as compared with $1.125 billion in 2014. That's an increase of $12 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, the operating income in 2015 totaled $767.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over 2014. On the positive side, we had a $35 million increase in revenues due to the Wisconsin rate order. We also had $10.4 million of improved fuel recoveries and lower O&M cost, in part driven by lower benefits cost and reduced maintenance expense in the fourth quarter, decreased expenses by $10.2 million. On the downside, we estimate that our electric and gas margins decrease by $35.3 million, driven by warmer fourth quarter weather. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the second warmest in the history of We Energies. In addition, depreciation expense rose by $16.8 million with additional capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $3.5 million increase in adjusted Utility operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014. Our Non-Utility Energy operating income was $373.4 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $4.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Taking the changes for these segments together, you'd arrive at $12 million increase in adjusted operating income. During 2015, earnings from Wisconsin Energy's investment in American Transmission Company totaled $54.5 million, which was an $11.5 million decline from 2014. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. ATC re-evaluated those reserves in the fourth quarter and decided to increase them. Other income net increased by $24.3 million, driven in large part by second quarter asset sales. Higher AFUDC, driven primarily by our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin, also contributed. 2015 net interest expense increased by $2 million. This was driven by slightly higher long-term debt, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $2.7 million for 2015. Our higher taxable income was slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate. Looking forward, we expect WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5% for 2016. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $620.9 million or $2.73 per share for 2015. Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group on a GAAP basis, which includes six months results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flow totaled $1.294 billion, which is a $95 million improvement over 2014. A major driver of the improvement was the inclusion of legacy Integrys companies for six months, which added both to depreciation and deferred income taxes. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $41 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2015. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. For comparison purposes, the annual sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual 2015 retail deliveries fell by 1.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries fell by 0.8%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding the iron ore mines, also fell by 0.8% compared to 2014. Looking at the individual customer segments now, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries fall by 1.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell by 2%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal deliveries rose by 0.2%. Actual deliveries fell by 0.1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2015 fell by 3.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.4%. Our 2015 weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 1.5% compared to 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 11% compared to the polar vortex-driven gas sales in 2014. For 2016, we will forecast and discuss delivery results for the State of Wisconsin, our largest segment. Our Wisconsin segment includes the results of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. Note that, with decoupling, gas deliveries in Illinois are not as tightly tied to financial results. So in Wisconsin, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.3% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mines. That compares to a 0.1% decline in 2015. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on any significant gains in energy usage by our customers. Looking at 2016 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to decline by 0.1%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to decline by 0.3%. And in the large commercial and industrial group, we are projecting an increase of 1.2%, excluding the mines. We project 2016 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.5%. Turning now to our capital forecast. As Gale mentioned, we expect to invest at least $1.5 billion per year in capital projects, or $15 billion in the next decade. Correspondingly, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in 2016, primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We will continue to evaluate both our short-term and long-term capital investment plans in light of bonus depreciation. Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2016. As previously mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 6% to 8% off a base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Taking into account January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related costs. Once again, first quarter guidance for the WEC Energy Group is $0.99 to $1.03 per share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're suddenly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our shareholders. Operator : And now, we would like to take the questions. Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Afternoon, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon and congratulations to both of you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Thank you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely. So perhaps just... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : (26:12), Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely. Thank you. Kicking it off here, I'd just be curious, Peoples Gas, just the earned ROEs and expectations into 2016, looks like there could be a nice pick-up there. But I'd be curious if you can elaborate kind of what you're thinking about an earned ROE embedded in that range. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Or what should we be thinking about for that segment? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I am really glad you asked, Julien. Let me first say that for calendar year 2015, the Illinois utilities, Peoples Gas and North Shore, earned their allowed rate of return, which is 9.05% (26.54) and that's exactly what's embedded in our forecast for 2016 earnings guidance. I know you had... Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...questions about whether we could achieve that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : No, well, there we go. And then secondly, I'd just be curious, in terms of the bonus depreciation, if you can elaborate a little further there. Can you discuss a little bit more what the offsets were for 2016 and how you were able to entirely offset it? And then looking forward a little bit more prospectively here, could you talk about what there too, what are the items adding up in terms of added spend, et cetera, to make it up? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me try to frame that for you, and if any of our guys want to add additional detail, feel free to do so. But for 2016, since there will be no \u2013 basically, there will be no base rate changes for calendar 2016 across our major utilities. We really don't see any immediate type of a hit in terms of bonus depreciation. However, in terms of the cash that we'll be receiving, it has allowed us to pull forward several important infrastructure projects. Really it's not large projects, but it's things like replacement of additional underground lines, substation transformer replacements, et cetera. Virtually all of that is in Wisconsin and that's worth about an additional $100 million that we've identified so far for 2016 just as an example. So I think most of the projects that we are looking at that will be able to be funded with the bonus depreciation cash are exactly those types of projects; on our gas delivery networks and on our electric delivery networks, all related to reliability, all related to upgrading, modernizing and hardening for safety purposes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great, excellent. And then last, just follow-up there if you can, thinking big picture CPP longer term, we've heard a lot of other states talk a lot about adjacencies to Canada and imports. Can you talk a little bit more about the Manitoba Hydro opportunity in the long term and how that fits into your five-year and 10-year CapEx plan? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it really has no impact on the 5-year CapEx plan or really nothing specific in the 10-year CapEx plan. However, and I'll ask Allen to talk about this, if there are going to be more hydro imports from Canada, there clearly would have to be additional transmission built. Allen? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Yeah. So, of course, the Manitoba Hydro, we wouldn't actually be an investor, we will be an offtaker of the power. So in terms of a direct investment, we wouldn't have any direct investment in the hydro units themselves. But as Gale mentioned, if you're going to have deliverability and actually be able to affect the generation dispatch in Wisconsin, you'd have to be able to deliver it, so you'd need the electric transmission. But at this point, we certainly don't have a number on what that investment might look like. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Still a bit early. But it is something indeed that you're interested in exploring, correct? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Yeah. I mean, I think it's something \u2013 another item in the toolbox that would help us potentially with compliance. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And to Allen's point, Julien, if we're facing, as a state, in Wisconsin a 41% reduction in CO2 emissions, we're going to need every cost-effective tool we have. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Thank you, Julien. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rock and roll, Jim. How are you? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: But without Mexican food. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Without Mexican food. Well, you know... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It may change a little bit, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: So not to quote The Who or anything, but the question really is for Allen. So how would you describe your management style versus Gale's? And what would you say are the nuances in your respective strategic visions for WEC going forward? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, man, this is going to be interesting. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Well, Jim, that's such a long... James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Has your post been paid yet, Allen? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: That's such a long question; I'm going to give you a very short answer. And it's probably easier for me to talk about what won't change, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: And we talked about a lot of things that will, and Mexican food \u2013 no Mexican food at the staff meetings. But what won't change is really a focus on execution and delivering results. So that's a short answer to your very long conceptual question. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: But that's what won't change. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Let me ask you a second broad topic before I go into a modeling or two question. With respect to growth, what we've seen over the last several weeks from the companies that have been reporting is that not all G is created equal. Can you talk about why your G is standing out and why you're so confident in your 5% to 7% longer term growth rate? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll take a shot at it. Allen certainly should offer his view. I think the reason we're confident in our 6% to 8% growth in 2016 and then 5% to 7% afterward is essentially the need for the significant capital investments in the kinds of projects that we have embedded in that 10-year plan. Our huge generation projects are behind us by and large. But the kind of reliability upgrades, the kind of modernization that's needed on the natural gas delivery networks and the electric delivery networks, those are essential for reliability going forward. And when we see the significant backlog that we have and, of course, our capital spending doubling with the acquisition of Integrys compared to standalone Wisconsin Energy, the need and the backlog of the projects gives me, at least, very significant confidence in our ability to hit the growth rates. Allen? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Yeah. I guess the only thing I would add, Jim, to Gale's comment, quite a bit of the investment we're looking at is in the natural gas side of the business. So there is a clear need from an infrastructure standpoint. So I think that's something else that you should keep in mind when you look at the longer-term numbers. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And to Allen's point, Jim, it's not just Chicago. We have a significant amount of natural gas delivery network investment in Wisconsin as well. And for that matter, expansions in Minnesota, in Rochester, growth in Michigan with the natural gas utility there. So I think we said earlier that about $800 million a year on average of our $1.5 billion of capital investment will be devoted toward the natural gas delivery business. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Switching over to a couple financial questions, can you talk broadly about your financing plans for 2016 and 2017 in terms of expected debt issuances, maybe on a net basis? And then talk about your free cash flow expectations over the same period with free cash flow being defined both pre and post dividend? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. We'll let Pat and Scott talk with you specifically. I will say that right now the first thing we have out of the box in 2016, and we announced it earlier this week, is a tender offer for the hybrids or a portion of the hybrids that were outstanding at TEG. It's one of the issues of the hybrids that we have a tender offer for right now. So that's the first refinancing or the first financing opportunity that we have that's underway right now. Pat? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. And them Jim, in 2016, this is actually a pretty light year for us. We only project right now to have two bond offerings, one in Wisconsin Gas probably in the first half of the year, and then at PGL in the second half of the year. So this is \u2013 certainly relative to last year, not a lot going on. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Let me be a bit more straightforward. Do you expect to be free cash flow positive this year, next year? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : No, we do not. We do not expect to be free cash flow positive this year or next year. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: What's the delta versus being free cash? James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : I don't have that number at my fingertips, but part of what Gale said is we're evaluating, and my comments as well, as we evaluate the capital plan, even if I had that number, that would be a little bit in flux as we evaluate how to deploy that bonus depreciation cash we've received. So we can follow up when we kind of frame that up in a little more detail, if you'd like, but I'd rather not wallow around in it, if that's all right. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And Jim, an additional comment on that. Remember, we do not have any need to issue additional equity. So basically, we might be talking about a slight increase in commercial paper or one of these bond offerings that Pat laid out. But we're within the \u2013 I mean, we're basically within the confines of not needing additional equity and maintaining the current type of debt to capital that we've been historically maintaining. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome, Jim. Thanks for the comments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Greetings, Michael. How are you today? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm well. Congrats to both of you, gentlemen. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple of just questions, I want to make sure \u2013 I hopped on a tad bit late, so I want to make sure I understand. You've got your rate case filing coming in Wisconsin in the next couple of months, April-May timeframe I think. Should we imply that given the fact you have extra capital as part of bonus depreciation that the CapEx requirements or the CapEx spends for kind of the two-year period that case will cover, 2017 and 2018, potentially higher than what you kind of disclosed in the EEI-related slide decks given the fact you have a lot more capital available to you at that subsidiary \u2013 or at those subsidiaries? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think certainly because we now have the availability of additional cash through the federal government's extension of bonus depreciation, I mean, yes, we are looking at for the benefit of customers to be able to invest in more modernization than what you saw in our slide deck in terms of the 10-year capital plan. Because as you'll recall, we did not take for granted that there would be an extension of bonus depreciation when we laid out the new 10-year capital plan at the EEI Conference in November. So yes, I think you could expect us to have additional capital investment, again, along the lines of additional upgrading of our natural gas and electricity delivery networks, particularly in Wisconsin. But in light of the fact that this is additional cash coming in, it really would not have any material effect on our rate review. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Meaning as long as the CapEx increase and the bonus D&A impact on rate base are a one-for-one swap. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Correct. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. You stated it very well. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And are there enough projects that you don't need to \u2013 that don't have lengthy approval processes where you could make a $400 million to $500 million a year increase in your capital budget for like the 2017-2018 timeframe? And that just seems like a very significant increase. If you're saying that bonus D&A is worth about $1 billion to you, that would be a pretty significant increase to the capital budget. I'm just trying to think about the ability to actually execute that type of CapEx increase. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we don't have $400 million to $500 million a year of additional projects, but I would say to you that looking at our legitimate backlog of investment needs, what we can pull forward is very significant. And then in the back half of that period, remember the period is really 2015 through 2019, in the back half of that period, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, if the proposed time table for the clean power plant compliance stays on track, we may be looking at the need for investment in our fleet either additional renewables, additional natural gas-fired generation. So those could be some fairly large projects in the back half of this period that we're talking about, but certainly in the front half of the period, 2016, 2017-ish. We really are looking at smaller discrete projects, such as additional ability to replace aging underground lines, replace and upgrade substation transformers, more distribution automation, those types of projects. They really don't meet the threshold of a specific approval from any of the regulators. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And this one maybe for Allen. Just trying to think about ATC and the impact bonus depreciation would have on ATC's earnings power and therefore its earnings contribution up to WEC. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Yeah. So I think when Gale talked about, in the prepared remarks, the $1 billion worth of cash from the tax savings, that included in effect our ownership share of ATC. So it's certainly not in addition to that. It's already included in that estimate. As you know, Michael, the transmission projects are pretty long lead time, so I can't see anything at all at or (40:37) ATC's capital budget of 2016 and 2017. But the team at ATC is looking at things that can be pulled into the back half of the period that Gale mentioned, say, in 2018 and 2019, which would allow us or ATC to pull some projects up that are beneficial to customers. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Last one, and somebody asked a little bit of this, but I'm just curious. You issued a lot of very low cost debt at the holding company to pay for Integrys \u2013 to pay for part of the equity component of Integrys. Just curious about how you are thinking about over the next two to three, three to four years, how much of that holding company debt you would like to term out versus how much of that holding company debt you would like to simply take out and reduce the leverage at the holding company level. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Very good question, Michael. And the honest answer to you is, we're going to continue to iterate as we move along. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have additional distribution network projects that we can use the additional cash to very beneficial use for customers. As Allen mentioned, there are maybe some additional transmission investments in the back half of that five-year period. There may be a generation investment because of Clean Power Plan compliance. But the other option we have is further deleveraging of the holding company. There will be some deleveraging in the plan to begin with. It just will happen, given our \u2013 the way we've laid out our forecast. But we also have the opportunity to deleverage. So what we are going to do as we continue to move forward through this period here is we're going to say, okay, what is the best use of the cash for our customers and shareholders, and put that cash to the best use we can. And what we were trying to do for you is lay out the series of options that we have that will balance going forward. So I can't give you a precise answer at this point in time other than additional beyond the plan deleveraging of the holding company is an option. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Gale and Allen. Much appreciated. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Welcome. I will you see in a few days, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I will see you in two weeks, yes. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Greetings, Brian. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're good. Are you wonderful and award winning today, Brian? Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Just to follow on that last question on the parent debt, when is the first call date? I mean, you'd probably have to pay a premium prior to callable dates, correct? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Are you thinking about the holding company debt, or are you talking... Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, holding company debt. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we got to carve it up. There's multiple debt instruments at the holding company, Brian, between the hybrid. Are you talking specifically the acquisition debt? Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, acquisition debt. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry. The acquisition debt, the first tranche expires at the end of three years, so 2018. So, it was three, five and 10 years, so 2018, 2020 and 2025. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Three, five and 10 years, and then about $300 million of commercial paper. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. And just to be clear, this is embedded in your 5% to 7% EPS CAGR or it's an addition to it? Just how does those moving parts work in terms of the CAGR? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : When you say \u2013 all of that debt is embedded. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): No. I mean, is there assumption for debt reduction of the acquisition debt in the 5% to 7% CAGR? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, we're assuming that \u2013 again, we want to see what kind of flexibility we have, but we'll either retire it or refinance it. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Dan, how are you? Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Good. And congratulations to both of you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Dan, I am so glad you called since this is my last call, and I've been wanting to have a conversation with you about all the advice that I've freely given you about your behavior over the years, and I'm hoping that I've been helpful to you \u2013 improved behavior on your part. I was just thinking, though, with this being my last call, I just wanted to offer you, and you can certainly feel free to think about this, but I just wanted to offer you perhaps, for a nominal fee, being your life coach going forward. What do you think, Dan? Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : You mean Allen isn't going to take that over? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Dan, now we know there's going to be a second change. No more Mexican food and no kicking Jenkins around. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I know you're going to miss that, Dan. But what can we do for you today, Dan? Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : First just a clarification. You gave your expectation for 2016 on the energy sales. And I'm not sure I got for the large industrial ex mines. It was 1-point-what? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 1.2%, Dan. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : And so, related to that, I was kind of curious where you see that coming from, given how 2015 performed, that seems like kind of a pickup. But I wondered if you could give us more color on that. And somewhat related to that, I was wondering if you are seeing any impact in the sand customers related to what's going on with the energy. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : A very good question, Dan. And let me try to cover the waterfront for you. Pat and Scott should add any color they would like to add. But first of all, let me tackle the frac sand. In essence, given the frac sand operations, and there are about 110 of them in the western part of the State of Wisconsin. We really don't serve electricity to any of the major ones in the western part of the state. It's really \u2013 that's really natural gas demand for us. And because we've just completed in November the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in Wisconsin gas history, we haven't up till now served a significant amount of the frac sand demand for natural gas. So while the frac sand industry has declined along with the big drop in oil prices, we still have an opportunity to grow over the longer term and the medium term in terms of our natural gas distribution service to that industry in the western part of the state. So long story short, because we haven't had a lot of the service in place or a lot of the capability in place up until now, we've not really been hurt to any significant degree by the decline in the frac sand business in light of the oil crash, if I'm making any sense. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Sure. Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Then in terms of industrial demand for electricity and how are we seeing a percent-or-so growth, a couple of thoughts and then we'll ask Scott Lauber, our Treasurer, who tracks our electricity demand. I track it every day, he tracks it every hour. Long story short, we serve 17 different sectors of the industrial economy in the State of Wisconsin, and many of those sectors are either flat or slightly down when you look at 2015 performance. But there are four sectors where we have significant concentration in Wisconsin that actually have shown a little growth and we think may continue to show some growth in our projections in 2016. So that's food processing, paper production, printing, and plastics. So those are fairly large industrial sectors. Among the 17, those four are pretty large. And we've actually seen some uptick throughout 2015 in those four sectors. And that, in part, underlies the percent-or-so growth that we're projecting for 2016. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer: In addition, we have some attractive rates to bring in new customers into the area. So we are actually seeing some customers building specifically in Southeastern Wisconsin some distribution centers, Amazon built here. So we're seeing that \u2013 and those actually are increasing our load in 2016 also. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's a very good point. And, for example, Scott mentioned Amazon, well, they just built a 1 million square foot distribution center that's now operational. And now that they've got it operational, I believe they've announced they're adding another 250,000 square feet right immediately adjacent to the 1 million square feet that they just built. Uline, which is a major company that has moved to Wisconsin in the last seven or eight years, is just growing by leaps and bounds, and they're adding distribution capacity. So we're seeing, as Scott said, not only some strength in some of the traditional clusters in Wisconsin, but we're also seeing some large commercial growth that is now in place and beginning to operate. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Then the second thing I was curious about, you mentioned that your kind of two workshops in of the six workshops around the main replacement plan at Peoples Gas, I was wondering if you could give a little color on kind of what the discussion's been there in terms of the Commission concerns or Commission directives or if they've had any recommendations. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, actually, no recommendations yet. But I've been very encouraged by the entire approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has decided to take in terms of taking, as we suggested, a fresh look at the entire program. The workshops are very granular and technical in nature. So for example, at one of the workshops, folks from the federal pipeline safety administration have been invited to come in and discuss the 2011 call to action from the federal government to replace some of these aging cast iron and bare steel pipes. So this is \u2013 the way that workshops have gone so far, and you're right, two of the six have been completed, and the subject matter for the remaining four are public and the agendas are public. It's really almost stepping back and let's taking \u2013 take a complete reexamination for the need, the schedule and the shorter and long term cost estimates. And then importantly, and one of the workshops will be dedicated to this, cooperation and collaboration with the City of Chicago. And I can't tell you how important that is. I mean, while we are in the process of trying to replace 2,000 miles of aging underground pipes in Chicago, the City of Chicago is also trying to replace a significant number of aging water mains. So cooperation in terms of trying to get that work done in a scheduled collaborative basis is a real issue that needs \u2013 we need to continue to work on this. I think we've made real progress with the City of Chicago in terms of sharing information and planning for construction. But one of those workshops is really going to be dedicated to, okay, how can the two entities that are ripping up streets in Chicago best work together. So very technical in nature, but really going through \u2013 again, it's almost a complete new primer on the need for the program and how the program should be structured and scheduled going forward. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So would you expect any revisions potentially to the CapEx budget related to the resolution of this process or how should we think about that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the way I would think about it is, certainly the Illinois Commerce Commission is interested in the timetable and the cost. And originally, the commission set a deadline of 2030 to complete that program. I think we all want to talk about is that still a realistic deadline for completing the program; how much can efficiently and effectively be spent in any given year, and how much risk would be taken if you extended the program. But right now, while all of that is still being processed and all of that's still being discussed, and I believe the Commission will vote on a new plan in June, the best advice I could give you is to stick with the $250 million to $280 million a year investment plan. That's what we're finding right now. It's probably the sweet spot in terms of how much can be done efficiently during the construction (53:58) Chicago. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then just wanted to say, given your successful completion of Power the Future and Integrys, you've obviously made a large impact on the company and left a tough legacy for Allen to follow. So, good luck. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : To whom was that addressed? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Thank you, Dan. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Bye. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Bye-bye. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Steve. You don't need a life coach, do you? Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : I hope not. Thanks, Gale, and congrats on your retirement on time and on budget. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Congrats as well to Allen. So just a quick follow-up on the Illinois process. So could you maybe give a little color if the AG's office is kind of involved in these discussions on this kind of new plan? And then also, there is some attempt to still go back and keep looking back at what happened, just any color on where you see that process heading? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd be happy to, Steve. First of all, the six workshops that the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled, the invitees are really all of the parties that have been involved in this entire program from day one. So it would be the Citizens Utility Board, it would be the City of Chicago, it would be the State Attorney General's Office. It would be a significant representation from the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. In fact, the workshops are being moderated by the head of the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. And all of the folks that have been invited to participate are participating. From what we've seen so far in the first two workshops, I would say that there are more informational type questions. I mean, for example, the State Attorney General's Office has asked, \"Well, does all the cast iron pipe that's a certain age really need to be replaced?\" So they're very technical questions. I mean, this is almost, I think, a terrific opportunity to get everybody on the same basis in terms of information and knowledge about the program. So I'm actually very encouraged by the approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has taken. I think it will be an opportunity, again, to put everybody on the same basis of information and also really have a very strong dialogue with the natural gas division of how the company and the City of Chicago need to cooperate in the streets. So that's really kind of the color I would give you so far. Again, very encouraged by the participation, by the kind of questions, and by the understanding that's building that with this kind of aging infrastructure, this is something that should not, cannot be ignored. So that would be my thoughts on the workshops. And again, we've filed a three-year plan that put our top priorities in place for the neighborhoods that we thought were most at risk, and we'll see what the Commission decides. But their plan would be to vote on the longer-term future for the advanced main replacement program by June. And again, I would say to you, given everything we've seen around the country, both from a natural gas and water standpoint, it's just not \u2013 I don't think anyone thinks it's wise to ignore the urgent need to upgrade that system in Chicago. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And then going backward, the Attorney General's Office is asking, as they have, about an $8 billion cost estimate for the long-term investment need of the program, and that need or that cost estimate surfaced, as you know, immediately after we acquired the company. And so the Attorney General's Office is wondering, who knew in the prior company, the prior management, about the $8 billion estimate and why was the $8 billion estimate, which was a preliminary estimate, why was that not disclosed prior to the closing of the acquisition? So that docket, if you will, is still open before the Illinois Commerce Commission. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Good luck. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. How are you today? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : All right. Congratulations to both you.. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Thank you. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : ...and Allen. One quick one for you here. The sales growth projection, does that include leap year or is that taken out? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That actually, includes leap year. Yep. It's worth about 0.3% (59:19). Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Right. So that would indicate that you guys really are not expecting much in the way of any growth. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: Yep. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Has there been a change in how you've begun to forecast things since it's been, generally speaking, lower than what you guys had \u2013 over the years, you guys have been a little bit more optimistic about sales growth than what's actually happened. Have you reappraised that, or are you guys just getting more \u2013 or is there something else that's driving you to wind down the sales growth? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think certainly given the experience of 2015 and 2014, and obviously we were projecting at least 0.5% growth in electric demand or electric consumption on the retail side in those prior years, we brought it down a little. There's no question about that. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : What do you think is going on? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think there may be a couple of things here. And we ask ourselves \u2013 we have all kinds of meetings saying, what the hell is going on? But first of all, many companies in our industry were projecting far stronger growth than we have projected, and they haven't seen it develop either. My own view, and this is strictly a personal view and anecdotal, but just based on years of experience, I think there are three things going on. 2014 and 2015 may be a bit of an aberration from a small commercial and residential standpoint. 2014 and 2015, the weather was just mild is probably the best word, mild summers, mild winters, just no abnormally high or abnormally low temperatures, but no persistence of a weather trend. And one of the things that weather normalization techniques does not pick up is the lack of, say, 15 days of 90-degree weather. If you have two days of 90-degree weather, you can do the weather normalization. But I don't think it picks up the fact that you didn't have any persistent weather one way or another and persistent weather drives consumption and drives usage. So, I think one thing that has happened is we haven't seen a really good long heat wave and even though last winter was a little bit colder than normal, it was spotty. It wasn't 15 days in a row of 10 degrees. So, in my mind, the jury is still out related to longer-term growth. If we get back to a year in which we have some consistent and persistent weather patterns. That's number one. But number two, I don't think there's any question that we're seeing more residential conservation in the last couple of years. I don't think there's any question about that. And when you think about why that may be, I mean, it really comes down to technology. You've heard me say before that if you replace a big screen television that you may be bought seven or eight years ago with a brand new one, you're probably going to use 60% to 80% less electricity. Your iPad requires less energy to charge than your computer screen standalone. You buy a new washer and dryer. They're far more energy efficient, same thing with refrigerators. You have the Nest thermostats. There's just a lot more technology available to customers. So essentially, what we're kind of seeing here is our customer growth, which continues to be good, being offset by conservation. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. There have been some articles about these coal dust complaints by neighbors in around Oak Creek. Can you comment on that in terms of how should we think about that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Well, first of all, let me just reiterate that we have air monitors that continually give us data on emissions from the Oak Creek plant, and we are well within compliance with all the air standards, number one. Number two, there are a number of homes in the general vicinity of the Oak Creek plant where individuals have indicated they are having health problems, and they believe it's because of the infiltration of coal dust in their homes. So, what we've agreed to do and what we're in the process right now is we have agreed with those homeowners on a testing protocol, and we are having a firm (1:03:55) go into each one of these homes and through samples collected them from various places in the homes of these individuals. And then we're having a lab analyze the dust samples and indicate to all of the homeowners \u2013 we're sending them over, explaining what is in their dust samples. Right now, the scene would indicate that there are health problems, at least from our expert standpoint, nothing that would indicate that there are health problems from any prevalence of dust. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then back to the deleveraging potential, what would be the security or what would be the interest rate that you guys might be thinking about retiring? In other words, if you were to pay down debt at the parent, what are we thinking about in terms of the cost of that debt? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the average cost of the debt was 2.21%. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Well, let's separate, I think it's important to kind of separate out the debt. There's the acquisition debt, which is the 2.21% as Gale just pointed out, and then there's all the other debt at the holding company. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Example of which is the hybrid security that flips the floating at the end of this year. That's I believe paying 6.11% right now. And there's also some longer-term debt instruments at the holding company. Think of the hybrids and those longer-term bonds is what we're targeting for takeout, not the 2.21% debt. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So the 6.11% would be the sort of pre-tax benefit you guys would see from buying it back, is that right? What you're thinking \u2013 I mean, obviously, (1:05:43) acquisition team may browse. But is that kind of what we're thinking about in terms of what the cost of the securities you're thinking of retiring potentially would be? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's one good example or if it wasn't retired and again, we're assessing what the best options are here. If it wasn't retired, it flips to a very low floating interest rate, right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Right. I mean, that's why I'm sort of wondering about it. I mean, it would seem to me, what we're seeing is a lot of leverage that's being deployed in terms of acquisitions that are being proposed and what have you recently. And I'm just wondering given the cost of debt, it doesn't usually look like that big a bang for the buck. And I just wonder if you'd elaborate a little bit more in terms of you're thinking process about that. Your credit ratings for the most part are pretty strong. So, I mean, I'm just sort of thinking about sort of why you guys are bringing this up now and sort of what might be driving that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll give a shot at that. I think the real answer to your question is we wanted to show the range of options that we have for beneficial use of the cash that's coming from bonus depreciation. And clearly, our preferred option is to benefit customers from that cash with projects that really are useful and needed for reliability. So that's option one, two, three, four, and five. And, as Allen mentioned, there may be \u2013 in the latter part of that five-year period for bonus depreciation, there may be the emergence of some transmission projects or generation projects for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. So all of those things are kind of preferred options. But if none of those things or if not all of them came to pass, we also have an option to further deleverage beyond the plan. So, it really wasn't \u2013 we didn't mean to give you the idea that this was going to be an immediate type of a preferred priority. It is something we have in the toolbox if needed. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. But not perhaps all that likely to be used, depending on what opportunities are in the business as well? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's how I would look at it. It is an option, and we'll iterate as we go along for the best benefit of customers and shareholders. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much and congratulations again. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. How are you? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'm well. Thank you. It's February in Cleveland, and the kids in the neighborhood are wearing shorts. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Man, it's amazing, isn't it? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Crazy. As you look at Manitoba Hydro and ATC, what kind of incremental capital opportunities do you see there? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: At this point, I really can't give you an estimate. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just too early? Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: It's just too early. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's too early. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And what was the fuel, under or over recovery in the fourth quarter? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In the fourth quarter we were fully recovered I think going into Q4. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: So it's... Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then your comment... Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: We'll follow offline... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We'll get the precise number for you and we'll get the precise number and we'll ask Colleen or Beth to give you a callback. But it was not a material impact on earnings in Q4. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then can you review your comments on Trillium and what the gain is and when you'll realize that? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll ask Allen to comment but we expect pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $130 million. But again, that sale falls within the window of purchase price accounting adjustments. So, in terms of the report of ongoing earnings that we would provide to you next quarter, it won't have any impact on plus or minus on earnings. Allen? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Oh, go ahead... Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Allen was saying, yeah. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Congratulations, Allen, and happy trails (1:09:53), Gale. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you so much. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : My favorite, Andy Levi. How are you, Andy? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Hey. I'm doing well. I just want to say thanks, Gale. You've done a great job. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, Andy. I appreciate your support. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: I appreciate your friendship over the years. And Allen, I remember meeting you when you were an IR person back at Southern. I remember saying to Paul Patterson that you'd make a great CEO one day. So, there you go. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I bet. Were you one of the first (01:10:31)? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Seriously, Allen. You will do a great job. I know you will and... Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: I appreciate it, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: ...I congratulate you. And actually all my questions were asked and answered. So, I'm good. I'm great. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Andy, thank you so much. We'll see you soon. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Yeah. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi guys. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The last guy is up. A double dip today. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. A follow-up question. Quick new bucket, since there's been so many moving pieces here, what you expect maybe broadly speaking, the earnings contributions from WPS, We, Power The Future and Peoples, just the big buckets, for 2016, just so our models are all calibrated correctly? Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I'm going to look toward Pat and Scott. I've got a general idea, but they've got more specific bucket delineation than I have right in front of me. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Can I do it by segment, Jim? That might be easier on the call. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Why don't we take it by segment and like by state. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So by segment or by state, if you look at Wisconsin, maybe 16%; 11% Illinois; 2% from our MERC and MGU, so our Michigan and Minnesota Gas Utilities; maybe 10% from ATC. What does that give me, Power the Future? And Power the Future is... Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer: 20%. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Do the math in whatever I missed, 20%? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: 71%, 81%, 83%, so 17%. Allen L. Leverett - President & Director: 17%, somewhere in that zip code. That Scott's trustee calculator back of the envelope. We can get you something a little more crisp, but that's directionally correct. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: So then where's the 5% to 7% earnings growth coming from? Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer: All of those entities. It's actually 6% to 8%. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : 6% to 8% next year, then we can kind of step through that as \u2013 when we have the new investor materials, we could probably walk through where each segment is moving relative and how that could contributes to the 6% to 8%. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer : Again, we will see earnings growth from every one of those segments. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think that concludes our conference call for today. And if you have any further questions, the famous Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office, 414-221-2592. Thanks again, everybody. So long.",

Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Analysts : Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2016 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Charlene. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welcome Scott Lauber as our new Chief Financial Officer. Many of you know Scott from his previous role as our Treasurer, but before that he had a number of other roles in our accounting and finance organization. Now Scott is taking over from Pat Keyes. Pat is now responsible for our operations in Michigan and Minnesota, as well as supply chain, information technology and strategy for WEC Energy Group as a whole. I also welcome Jim Schubilske as our new Treasurer. Like Scott, Jim has held numerous positions in our accounting and finance organization and he was most recently responsible for our State Regulatory area. Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President, leads our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Groups are also here with me. So with that, let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 results. WEC Energy Group was formed in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Integrys in June of last year. Until now, we have focused our discussion on Legacy Wisconsin Energy standalone results. Starting today, our focus shifts to the entire company's results. We reported first quarter earnings of $1.09 a share that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share in the first quarter of 2015. Scott will be reviewing the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. Now taking a look at the state of the economy for our largest segment, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, which is well below the national average. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68.7%, which is more than 5 points above the national rate. Also worthy of note, Wisconsin led the nation in adding manufacturing jobs in March. Electricity used by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. Our electric utility's large customers, excluding the iron ore mines consumed approximately 0.8% less electricity in the first quarter compared to 2015. However, we continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy including plastics, food processing and paper production. In addition, we are continuing to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our Wisconsin utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers, and nearly 11,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota added nearly 16,000 customers in the past year. This increase includes the acquisition of approximately 10,000 natural gas customers in Minnesota from Alliant Energy in April of 2015. We are achieving the results we expected from the Integrys acquisition. Our focus on cost controls and the tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. Subject to Public Service Commission of Wisconsin action, which is not expected, we will not file 2017 test year base rate cases this year for our Wisconsin utilities. As we have discussed on previous calls, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% of a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Here of course to delivering this growth is executing our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. I want to give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. Last December, Congress passed a tax bill that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits from the bonus depreciation extension, about two-thirds of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although, we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings in 2016, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 and following years. We have advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million, which includes the $100 million that we previously identified in the February call. As a result, we now forecast our 2016 and 2017 capital budgets at $1.55 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current five-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our five-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Financial Conference. Turning now to our operations in Illinois, we're moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program or AMRP at Peoples Gas, one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas infrastructure. Over the past nine months, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 18% complete. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission or ICC late last year that describes our top priorities for the next three years. The plan's key components include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast-iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, projected investment of $250 million to $280 million a year, and regular updates to the ICC and other stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress. While the engineering, fieldwork, and cost recovery of AMRP continued, the ICC held six workshops to assess our plan. These recently concluded workshops brought together key stakeholders to review the planned scope, schedule and long-term cost with a focus on safety and reliability. We expect that the ICC staff will issue its report late in May and that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the year. However, in the interim, the AMRP work will continue. Next, a brief reminder on our dividend. On January 21, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is now at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth. Before I ask Scott to review the details of our first quarter earnings, I want to cover one last item. I met with quite a number of investors and analysts, and including many of you over the last few months after our management transition was announced. Quite often I've been asked, Allen what will be different when you are a CEO. Now it's really easier for me to tell all of you what will be the same. Our company will continue to focus on the fundamentals, safety, customer satisfaction, reliability and financial discipline. I believe this focus has served us well since I joined the company in 2003, and will continue to do so. So, now for more details on our first quarter results, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 a share from $0.90 in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.09 a share in the first quarter of 2016. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $589.3 million as compared to an adjusted $367.6 million in 2015, an increase of $221.7 million. Starting with Wisconsin, operating income in the first quarter totaled $327.5 million for 2016, an increase of $50 million from the adjusted first quarter of 2015. On the favorable side, we realized $76.9 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service. This was offset by lower operating income from Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas related to the mild winter temperatures. We estimate that electric and gas margins of these two utilities decreased by $29 million because of the warmer weather. In the first quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment added $137 million of operating income and our other state segment added $31.8 million of operating income. We did not have operations in these segments until our acquisition of Integrys. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $800,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investments at our Power the Future plants. Our Corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $300,000 this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at the $221.7 million increase in operating income on an adjusted basis. During the first quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.5 million, an increase of $22.4 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase on our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the acquisition of Integrys. Our other net increased $29.7 million, largely due to repurchase of $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% Junior Subordinated Notes at a discount in February 2016, as well as higher AFUDC due to the inclusion of the AFUDC from the Integrys companies. Our net interest expense increased $41.5 million, driven by $34.8 million of interest expense from Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. Earnings from the Integrys company drove an increase in our consolidated income tax expense of $90.2 million. There were no significant changes in our effective income tax rate. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings us to $346.2 million of net income for the first quarter of 2016 or earnings of $1.09 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $365.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by $307.8 million of net cash flow from operating activities of Integrys during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining difference was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans partially offset by changes in working capital. You may recall that we contributed a $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. Our capital expenditures totaled $312 million in the first quarter, a $158.8 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 50.4% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $156.2 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $60.9 billion over the first quarter last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition, and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first quarter in 2015. For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the first quarter. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and factoring out the effect of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were down slightly by 0.2% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%. Now looking at the individual customer segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries dropped 0.3% while actual residential deliveries fell 4.2%. Across our small and commercial industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 1.5%, actual deliveries decreased 0.2%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2016 decreased 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries decreased 0.8%. Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 1% compared to the same period in 2015. Actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas for power generation, were down 10.7% compared to gas sales in last year's first quarter due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter were slightly below our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share, which represents 6% to 8% growth. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. We are off to a strong start, but still have nine months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share. Finally, let's look at the outlook for quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year. If we take a step back, we see new a quarterly pattern to earnings per share. The Integrys acquisition brings a larger gas component to the combined company. This means we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarter due to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years. This brings us to our second quarter earnings per share guidance. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and April being a little cooler than last year, we expect our second quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.51 to $0.55 per share. With that, I will turn things back to Allen. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Scott. I think, overall, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Congratulations, Allen. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : So thanks for the update on the CapEx. I'm looking at slide 14 from your April business update. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : And so you've taken your CapEx for 2016 to $1.55 billion versus $1.499 billion and you've taken your 2017 CapEx to $1.9 billion from $1.553 billion. Can you just review again what capital projects you've brought forward and if we should assume that that capital comes out of the 2018 to 2020 budget? Or are you also reevaluating customer beneficial projects that you could put in, move forward such that those would stay relatively level? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Greg, so, if I could, let me answer your second question, and then Scott, I'm going to ask you maybe to give Greg a little bit of color about the types of projects that we're advancing. So, Greg, on your second question, you should not assume that the increases that we're making in the 2016 and 2017 spending would result in a corresponding decrease in the later years, because we're also revaluating those later years. So, Scott, if you could, maybe just give Greg a little more background about some of the things that we're advancing. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Just to give you a few examples, over these last couple of months, we looked across the enterprise. And for example, we are looking and we are going to implement a neat \u2013 updating our ERP system, the general ledger, consolidations, so that part of the general ledger and that could be up to $100 million. Another example is, we looked at Wisconsin, the gas and electric distribution system, and we're increasing that about $150 million on value-added customer projects. And then, another area when we look at, in Illinois, we have a large gas storage facility, underground storage in Illinois, and we're going to spend about $35 million over the next couple of years, looking at safety reliability within that storage field. So, basically across the enterprise found some good projects to bring up and move forward into this period. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Great. And because of the impact of bonus depreciation, that doesn't really have a net \u2013 it's a net-neutral impact on what the customer would otherwise see in terms of bill impacts, correct? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : The capital costs? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Fantastic. And can you give us what a comparable pro forma theoretical quarterly earnings number would have been last year in the second quarter had you owned Integrys, so we could compare the $0.51 to $0.55 to that? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We looked at this at a very, very high level trying to take out all the acquisition adjustments and adjusting really just for the shares outstanding. It was about $0.53 \u2013 $0.52, $0.53. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for us as we roll through the year to get our minds around the new base of earnings. But would it be fair to say that as you stand today, if you were to assume normal weather and you were spot on your load growth forecast for the year that you are at the high end, low end, above, below your current guidance range for the year? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would say at this point, I mean, if you take it sort of \u2013 if you look at what happened with the hybrids in the first quarter, that was in our annual plan. It was just uncertain as to when in the year it would occur. So that certainly would not represent a pickup versus the financial plan. I think another significant driver, Scott, was related to fuel recoveries in Wisconsin where we had positive fuel recoveries in the first quarter. But our assumption for the year, Greg, would be that we would just be fully recovered. So I think given those two things, I would say that we're sort of more at the middle of our range. And as I look at it, we're sort of neutral against our financial plan. If you adjust for the items in the first quarter that I either expect would reverse in the case of the fuel recoveries or I had already included in the annual plan, it was just an uncertainty about the timing. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Fantastic. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Allen. Congrats again. So just on the rate case delay, can you give us a sense of whether kind of staff is supportive of that, if other parties have had a view, and when will we know when the commission is kind of okay with it? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it in terms of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin staff, they're okay with it, and they've indicated that to us in writing that they're in agreement with it. So, at this point, Steve, the commission itself, they don't have to take any action at all for there not to be a rate case. So, my expectation at this point, as I was saying in the prepared remarks, my expectation would be, we wouldn't file a case for base rates in 2017 \u2013 for 2017. However, I would expect, Steve, that in August, we would do a fuel filing for 2017 rates, and say more likely than not we might see a slight reduction in the fuel rate, but we'll have to look at our numbers when we file in August. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I thought you said in your prepared remarks not file 2017 subject to PSC approval. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : No. I didn't say subject to approval. I said subject to any PSC action. And so, just to be clear, they don't have to take any affirmative action here. So, if they do nothing, which would be my expectation, they wouldn't take an action, we wouldn't have a rate case. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And I assume what you are doing is utilizing merger synergies to help mitigate what would have been the rate needs. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Right. So, when we went through the process with the merger approval, we talked about the ability to get what we felt would be reasonably significant cost savings and we're seeing those materialize. And so that allows us to freeze base rates, which we think is a benefit to customers. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Could I just ask you to give us a little bit of a bridge between the $130-odd-million that Integrys booked in the first quarter of last year and the $160-odd-million that you have this quarter? Just what were the moving pieces? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : So, Scott, I think I'll let you, maybe based on the earnings package just give Jonathan a little bit of background. But I will say this, Jonathan, if you look across the Integrys companies, I think we really have these companies on track to all earn their allowed rates of return. So that's part of the difference that you saw as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Scott, do you want to fill in a little bit on that? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, also when we look at it, we had a full-year rate case at PGL. So, at our Illinois utility, there was a rate case that was effective I think in February of last year. So, we had a full rate earnings in there. We also had a rate case at Wisconsin Public Service, so that was also an increase. And remember, there's two pieces to the Wisconsin Public Service there was an overall it looked flat, but one of that was a fuel, but there was a base rate increase, so that came through. Once again, Allen talked about the fuel \u2013 the positive recovery in fuel and some of that was in the Wisconsin Public Service area too compared to prior year. We also had rate cases that were implemented at our smaller gas utilities in Michigan and Minnesota, both of those had rate increases this last year. So, basically getting the rate increases in, getting the cost control in, and getting on a path to get to the full return at all the utilities. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great, thank you. And then just on \u2013 I think that when you gave the second quarter guidance, I think I heard you right, you said that April had been a little cooler than normal in the context of the new gas year business mix. So is that a help or a hurt versus normal? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That's a great question. April is a transition month and so, in April, we're not really getting a lot of gas sales. It does help the gas a little bit. But on the electric side, April is a month when you get that commercial industrial buildings that actually uses some air conditioning. So, having a mile month here, we really don't \u2013 we see that little more of a down on our earnings more from the electric side not picking in yet than the gas side picking up the offset. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I mean, you called it out, but I'm guessing it's not that significant given it's April. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. No, it's $2 million to $3 million, maybe. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Jon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Hey, Allen. Couple of things. First of all, on a cents-per-share basis, the increase in other income related to the early pay-down at a discount of some of the Integrys debt, that's worth, what, roughly $0.05 to $0.06 in EPS? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me maybe talk about it in two pieces, Michael. Of course, we bought the securities I think at approximately 83% of par, so that resulted in a $0.04 per share impact in the first quarter. And they were repurchased, say, mid February, so there was a tiny bit of interest savings, Michael, in the first quarter, but very little, probably less than a tenth of a cent, but if you look forward to the rest of the year, we would expect to see another $0.01 per share benefit because of the \u2013 of the reduction in interest expense. So about $0.04 in the first quarter from the being below par, and then $0.01 in the remainder of the year for interest. And Scott, anything to add to that? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No, that's it. That's right on. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And can you talk about if you were to look at just the Integrys O&M in first quarter of 2015, and WEC \u2013 Legacy WEC O&M in that same period, and then combined, what was the O&M decline rate or O&M savings that you've realized so far year-to-date in 2016? And what do you \u2013 what's embedded in guidance? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, as we look at that in the O&M, and remember when you look at the O&M line, there's a lot more than just the O&M that's in the \u2013 what I would say, into the operations, there is O&M as it relates to regulatory amortizations, O&M that's related to the different riders. So, overall when we look at the O&M, we did have the savings that we had forecasted in with our \u2013 with the acquisition. When you look at \u2013 break back the different pieces, I would say on Wisconsin Electric, the O&M was up just a tad as it relates to a couple of storms we had in the area, and we accelerate a little bit of our forestry program because of the mild temperatures. We haven't specifically said what our O&M guidance is in the acquisition savings but overall when you look at it, it's probably O&M when you factored all the different stuff about 2% to 3% less than if you look at the combined adding up the simple O&M from the prior companies... Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And do you think you are in the early innings of realizing O&M savings or do you think you're at a pretty good run rate, meaning, do you still think, you have significant opportunity to takeout significantly more cost around the consolidated system from here? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I guess, you used the baseball analogy. So, I'd say we are probably in the third inning, and I think there is a fair amount of additional work that we can do. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you Allen, much appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hi. How you doing? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'm good. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : All right. Just on the rate freeze letter that came out last week, what \u2013 how was that triggered? I mean, was that just basically \u2013 was this related to the merger or what sort of triggered the \u2013 I guess, it seemed like maybe the staff, it wasn't clear to me the letter, what actually was causing the review by the staff? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, typically the cycle in Wisconsin every two years, of course you do a case for the next \u2013 for the next year, and then known and significant (33:24) for the year after that. So this was our year typically to bring the companies in, and we've had \u2013 we had discussions with the staff. And we said look, we believe because of the benefits we're seeing from the merger that we're just going to freeze rates. And if we have increased cost in other areas, we're going to offset that with the benefits of the merge and we're just going to freeze base rates. So the \u2013 basically the avenue for the discussions was this very regular cycle to file rate cases. And so, we work through that avenue and talk with the staff and it's something that they were agreeable. And it's kind of interesting, Paul, as a part of when we're doing the merger proceedings, many people talked about as a proposal doing a rate freeze. So, now we're actually seeing the base rate freeze for 2017 in Wisconsin. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then there was, as I recall, some sort of accounting treatment that was part of it. Could you elaborate a little bit more this? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, and let me sort of start and then I'll let Scott or Jim fill in any detail. So I think what you're referring to Paul is, at Wisconsin Public Service related to the ReACT project, and when Wisconsin Public Service went through their last rate case, so this was the rate case that was decided late last \u2013 late 2015 or 2016 rates. So they included in rates I believe at a $275 million level, the cost of the ReACT project. And so, we expect that the final cost of that project will be in a range of $335 million to $345 million. So, essentially what they would allow us to do with this accounting order is to differ in effect the impacts of the return off and on for that additional investment above $275 million. So, Scott.. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. That's correct. There's \u2013 I think as a total, there is three of them. The ReACT is the main one. The other two were some deferrals that specifically in the order they ended in December of 2016 and we said well, if we're going to be out for a year we just need the same accounting treatment in 2016 and in 2017, just to extend them into 2017. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. And then, just finally \u2013 I'm sorry you were talking kind of quickly on the weather-adjusted sales. Did that include leap year? That wasn't clear to me. Or I mean, was it adjusted for leap year or...? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Was leap year sort of left in there? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We factored out leap year. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So we adjusted as if \u2013 we adjusted it down as if leap year did not happen. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : So February 29 was out. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : It's factored out. Correct. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And that was minus 0.2% for retail sales in general, right? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Correct. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : How are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Good. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the first questions on the CapEx, perhaps just to kick it off. Can you elaborate a little bit on the next leg of the evaluation you kind of described by the EEI timeframe this fall you'll have the next round. What are the next layers of evaluation that you're looking at? Is there any kind of sense as to what genre of projects or at least magnitude of capital you could potentially be looking at in maybe these baseball analogies? How deep in terms of innings are you in terms of finding those acceleration opportunities? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Right. Well, you know as I mentioned earlier, about two-thirds of the impact is the bonus depreciation. So about two-thirds of the $1 billion is in 2016 and 2017. So, other than the second order effects associated with getting bonus depreciation on this additional property, I guess, we've identified $500 million of roughly $670 million. So I guess that's pretty late innings in terms of identifying offsets in 2016 and 2017. So I would say that Julien that the majority of our focus as we work through the rest of the year, up to when we have the November Finance Conference, the majority of our focus is going to be in the later years. And, Scott, I don't know if there is any other detail. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So, exactly the majority will be in the later years. We also are working on making sure we have all the resources and efficiently for 2017 spending, get everything lined up to put due to spending in. So, we will be working on those later years this summer. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And I think one thing Julien that maybe to give you a sense for how broadly we are looking, let's just take, for example, and this is not included in any of 2016 or 2017 numbers that we talked about, but one of the things we talked about a lot, although in Illinois and in Michigan, our gas utilities there actually own some gas storage, in Wisconsin, our gas utilities to my knowledge have never owned gas storage. They've always leased it. And, we think that it would make more sense to have a mix of owned storage as well as the leased storage. So I think that would be a nice opportunity \u2013 investment opportunity for the company. But we think it would also be beneficial for customers. So, we're trying to think broadly about what those capital opportunities might be, Julien. I hope that helps. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely. And does that also add into the decision to push out the rate case timing, recovery of the accelerated spend in 2016 and 2017 with the slightly delayed rate case. Is that kind of aligned with the thinking as well? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, it certainly contributes, but I think far and away the reason why we can freeze rates is because of the cost savings that we're seeing from the combination of the companies. But, you're right, I mean the accelerated depreciation impact acts as a bit of an uplift if you will also. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Great. And actually just turning back to what you just alluded to there, how much in terms of lease expense or just if you can give us a sense of how much of that PPA needs potentially acquired via any Wisconsin Gas storage opportunities? I know it's early days there, but I figured I'd ask. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Julien, in all candor, it's just a little early for me to throw those numbers out. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : No worries at all. We can leave it there. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. As we know more, I mean, that's certainly something we can chat about either on the call or a future call or at EEI. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, Allen. How are you? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : I am good. How about you? James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Pretty good. Switching topics, could we just talk about the transmission opportunities out there, specifically as it relates to Alaska? Are there any updates that we need to be aware of? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : No, Jim. There really aren't any updates at this point beyond what we talked about on our call, I guess, back in February. So nothing new there in terms of updates. Scott, anything you have to add on that? Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'm not aware of anything. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No. Nothing. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I guess, the question is, is transmission opportunities in the state of Alaska a function of the price of oil and the Alaska fiscal health? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, in terms of the briefing that I received from Mike Rowe who is the CEO out at ATC, what he has told me is, basically if you look at the local economy, integrating the operations of the utilities is a benefit regardless of what the price of oil is, regardless of how low or how high. There is a benefit of integrating those utilities because they're certainly not integrated at all at the level that you would see in the continental United States. So there are big benefits with that regardless of the price of oil. And sort of, I guess, ironically, the low oil prices actually mean that the companies in Alaska might actually look a little more to ATC to provide the capital for the transmission projects. So I would say, worst case, the oil prices are sort of a neutral and although it sounds a little strange, the lower prices might actually mean that marginally ATC might be called on to make a bit more of the investment that's required. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate the help. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jim. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Vedula. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Hey, Allen. How are you? Congratulations, and nice to hear from you. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No, I haven't talked to you in a long time. Glad you're doing well. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Anyways, you touched on these things kind of around the edges, but when you came in 2003 and your mission was fairly clear. You had Power the Future that had been improved, but it simply was a matter of execution and getting that done and the non-regulated businesses that you had to cleanup. So the focus was fairly clear and that gave you \u2013 that was basically a runway of about eight years from, say, 2003 until 2010, 2011, whatever. So I'm wondering today \u2013 it's like we're sitting here in 2016. You have the merger done and you have the big pipeline replacement program in Illinois and everything like that. I'm wondering just if you can kind of give a sense of how much runway you think you have here. And just, even if it's not necessarily as large or as dramatic as what was sitting in front of you in 2003, can you just put it in context the way you're thinking about it going forward over the next few years? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Right. Well, I think as you look at -- of course, Power the Future, I guess, you could think of it, if you just looked at the new generation that was being built. I mean, that was sort of, as it turned out, a roughly seven to eight-year program. So, as you say, that's in the past. As we look at sort of what's coming up, we've got some programs like the AMRP program in Illinois, which we're probably looking at decades long. I mean, you're looking at programs that are ongoing for 20 to 25 years at least. So we've got some programs that we think will be around a lot longer, even longer than Power the Future. We've got others that were kind of shorter in nature, and we talk some about the ERP project in Wisconsin. But I would say overall, Vedula, I mean, I think we easily have a runway of 10 or more years of capital investment that we think will benefit customers, in the case of Chicago, like a huge upgrade in safety. So I would say it's at least 10 years. But now it's really multiple programs in multiple states as opposed to being a single program and one and only in one state. I hope that helps. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Yeah. No, just to clear also I think you've also touched on this in terms of you talked a lot about load growth and just conservation, efficiencies, and everything like that. When you look back to 2003 or whatever, I mean, we were still seeing fairly strong growth in terms of usage and everything like that. Going forward, that's not necessarily going to be the case. But I'm just \u2013 in terms of supporting kind of the ability to continue to grow whatever in terms of your earnings or whatever, I'm just wondering whether the things you referenced should be enough, even without any real net load growth. And also the one other thing I wanted to ask you is, in the past, you used to talk about having a couple hundred million dollars of free cash flow, net of CapEx and dividends. Can you just kind of refresh us in terms of where that kind of stands going forward as well? Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And maybe, Scott, why don't you cover the cash flow question? But I would say, Vedula, I mean, clearly the situation with volume growth, be it electric or natural gas, it's going to be a bit of a headwind, which is why I think having the merger is beneficial to us, because we can generate some more cost savings to help deal with those headwinds. But Scott, why don't you give Vedula some background on the cash. Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. In looking at our cash and remember we said in our prepared remarks and just lately, we said in our prepared remarks, we are not issuing any equity. Part of the acquisition reasons were to invest in good utility projects. So we are investing in utility projects that are very needed for the infrastructure. When you look at 2016 and 2017, we are not cash flow positive, but we also look at our consolidated debt to capital ratio and our consolidated holding company debt. And the holding company debt as a percent of total debt is about 28%, consistent with our projections, and we see that continuing to be there. So we are not cash flow positive, but we are not issuing any equity, and that's for the 2016 and 2017 timeframe, and we'll look at our projections as we go forward as we look at our capital plans in the future. Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.: Thank you very much. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Vedula. Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, that concludes our conference call today. Thank you for participating. If you have any more questions, please contact Beth Straka or Colleen Henderson in our Investor Relations office. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker) Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Second Quarter 2016 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of management remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Charlene. Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, who is our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results, the end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition, which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings, in both 2015 and 2016, include interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1, asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is that our Minnesota gas utility where interim rates are in place. Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. Now, let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension, about two thirds of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017, as well as in following years. As you may recall from the first quarter call, we've advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we've made progress in the later years of our five-year forecast. We now expect to extend our electric System Modernization and Reliability Project at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current five-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our five-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Finance conference. Turning now to our operations in Illinois, we're moving forward on the Peoples' gas system modernization program formerly known as AMRP. This is one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete, and we continue to make good progress. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the three-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging cast-iron pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year. After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost forecast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy session in April summarizing the six workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the proceeding is expected to be completed within 30 days when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue. Now, I would like to briefly update you on two matters pending at the FERC. First at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50-basis-point adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this. The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring an approximate $20 million reduction to the payments we received for the period of February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year. Next, I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On January 21, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.395 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth. So, now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott. Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share, compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter last year. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculations of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliations. First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense, and income taxes. Referring to page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1, million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal. In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other states segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized an operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter, as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor costs. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at a $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income. Moving to other income, during the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase on our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews. Our other income net increased by $6.3 million largely related to higher AFUDC to the inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies. Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. Earnings from the Integrys companies were a primary driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $133.8 million or $0.58per share for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016. Now, looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first six months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital. While I am on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100-basis-point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On a enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this into our 2017 plan. Our capital expenditures, totaled $618.7 million during the first six months of 2017 (sic) [2016] (14:53). A $250.7 million increase, compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investments, at the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation treats half the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of a $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015. We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers, and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year. For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor all the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%. Looking now at the individual customer segments, weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8%, while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7%, actual deliveries increased 2.2%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 0.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.3%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines increased 0.4%. Now, an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have six months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business thus we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first quarter and fourth quarter due to higher \u2013 to gas heating margins, and relatively lower earnings per share in the second quarter and third quarter when compared to past years. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer than normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 per share to $0.59 per share. With that, I'll turn things back to Allen. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our call. Operator : Thank you. And now we'd like to take your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I apologize, I hopped on just a minute or two late. You guys, I was told, did increase your capital expenditure budget in the back half of the five-year plan. Can you go back and talk about how much of rate base growth was reduced by the impact of bonus depreciation? How much of that you had offset already prior to this update? And then how much incrementally you've found in customer-friendly projects that further mitigate that impact? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd be happy to, Greg. I think some review is good. And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach-back to 2015 as well as an extension out to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that $1 billion. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million and those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million between 2016 and 2017. And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. It's about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a four-year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involved distribution automation as well as undergrounding of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted, we expect to the undergrounding of electric distribution. So about $50 million in 2019, $50 million in 2020, and we also believe out in 2021 and 2022, there is yet another $50 million a year to do in those two years. And this program, it's been very, very popular with customers and it was interesting, this summer, we've had quite a bit of storm activity in the Wisconsin Public Service territory, and for those that had their service, had these distribution lines undergrounded, they saw a much less in terms of outage times. So it's been a very popular program. I hope that helps, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No, that helps tremendously. And is this a continuous review process, and as we get into the next quarter and we get to EEI that you're continuing to try to observe where you could put more capital to work that has further benefits for customers or is this the end of that review? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's really more of the former, Greg. So we'll keep reviewing the numbers, reviewing the programs, but what we're trying to do is take a very deliberate approach, because I think the terminology that you used earlier is important. Each of these have to be customer-friendly projects. So there has to be a reliability benefit, a cost benefit, a safety benefit, or environmental performance. It's really got to be something that's beneficial to our business and beneficial to our customers. So often that takes a little time to identify those kinds of projects. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. To what extent could changes in the potential mix of your generation fleet, as you look to de-carbonize, have an impact on that plan towards the backend, or would that potentially roll into the next decade, so that as you look at your coal fleet, and you start to think about how you are going to balance your carbon emissions. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And I think certainly with Clean Power Plan, and this is, I'm speculating. I don't know exactly when the first year of compliance would be with Clean Power Plan, but it's likely not to be until 2024 or after. So I would not expect, Greg. Certainly if you look into the capital forecast going out to 2020, which is what we have on the table today, I don't really see any benefit at all, at least in this forecast period, meaning from this year to 2020, from the impacts of Clean Power Plan. But hypothetically if you had a 2024 compliance date, ultimately with Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see some impacts out in that 2021, 2022, 2023 time period. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Two more quick questions. $0.55 to $0.59 assumes normal weather you said for the balance of the quarter, so I would presume it factors in what's happened to-date in terms of demand. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And Scott, you may want to talk a little bit about July and what we've seen in July in terms of weather. Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Yes. So it does include the month of July weather. Now, what we saw in July was it started out actually cooler than normal the first couple days and it didn't catch up to about normal degree day until about the July 17. So we really just had some warm weather the last week, week-and-a-half of July here. So we factored that in. Maybe it's $0.015 to $0.02, but that's factored into our guidance. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So we should watch the weather for the balance of the quarter and think about that accordingly if it's above or below normal, because you're assuming normal? Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Final question. In the normal cadence of your discussions with the Wisconsin Commission, at what point do you go into them and discuss whether or not you'd like to defer having a rate review again as you did this year? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, my expectation would be, if we follow past practice on timing, typically if you're going to do a filing, so let's say, for example, if we're going to do a filing in 2017 for rates that we request to be in effect in 2018, typically in the March-April timeframe you really need to make that filing. So if we follow past practice with timing, my expectation would be that soon after the New Year, January, February, you'd need to have some conversations with the staff about where we would propose to head. So that's how I would see the timing. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So a ways off. Thank you, guys. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Two quick things. I heard your comments on the pension discount rate and I think you said you're working on building that into the plan, if you do see the $35 million increase in 2017. So should we take the comment of building it into the plant to mean you'd expect to absorb that within the stated growth rate? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And I would say, maybe, to give you some additional color. The $35 million, part of that, to the extent that you capitalize labor expense and there is a certain amount of labor that gets capitalized when people do work on capital projects, now there'll be some amount of this $35 million that would effectively get capitalized as a part of that. My guess would be, right now, perhaps that $6 million or $7 million out of the $35 million, so not all of it would hit the income statement. But, yes, we'll have to and we expect to offset this as a part of our plan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then just on transmission return and how you've reserved, you mentioned the ALJ being 9.7% plus 50 basis point adder. Is that the number you've actually reserved to? And is that what you're looking on a go-forward basis or are those numbers different from what the ALJ? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, let me go through it in three pieces, because of course there are two investigations, if you will. So, there is the first period that goes from, I think, November 2013, help me Scott... Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. February 2015. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. And then we've got... Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : February to May 2016. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...2016. So in that first period, Jonathan, we're reserving I believe effectively the recommendation from the ALJ including the 50 basis points was 10.82%. So we're reserving at that level for that first period. For the second period, we're reserving at 10.2%, and then it's sort of an educated guess, but my view right now would be the that 10.2% is a pretty good assumption going forward and 10.2% is what we will assume when we build up our plan, when we finish our plan for 2017. I'm sorry, that's kind of a long answer, but there are all these players for these investigations. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that was very helpful. Thank you for the clarity on that. It's sometimes hard to keep track of. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, that's all. Good, thanks a lot. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Just on the Illinois process, for the gas spending, just could you give a little more color on what is going to be kind of addressed in that process, just basically, let's finalize your new long-term investment plan? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and maybe let me sort of give this, maybe in parts. And let me first maybe just give a little more color about that staff report, Steve, that that was issued at the end of May. So really what that report did, effectively the staff did not make any recommendations about the program effectively. What they did is, that the staff summarized all of kind of the key input from the stakeholders in that workshop process that they had earlier this year. Then what the staff just essentially said is, well, we believe you should have a docket to address the program. And we think you should have reporting mechanisms about the program in the interim before you make a decision and in the long-term once the decision is made. So really it's just kind of summary of what all the stakeholders said, and then in terms of what the commission would decide, at a high level what they said they want to do was cover the cost, scope and schedule for the near-term and the long-term. So, they still seemed to be of a very strong view that the program needs to continue. They just want to look again at the scope and the schedule, and in the interim, they fully understand that we're going to continue with that three-year program that I alluded to before, hopefully that's helpful, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Yeah. No, that's helpful. Just one other question on the pension, thank you for disclosing that information. I assume we're going to start hearing a lot more from other people. The normal course I assume that's a recoverable expense in rate cases? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, FAS 87 expense would generally be recoverable in your revenue requirements. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And so, but just in 2017, to a degree you don't have a rate case you'd have to manage the cost? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly right, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi there, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So perhaps a easy question here, just the dollar-for-dollar comment on the Presque Isle. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the assets there are? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And I guess what I was really alluding to in the primary one or one of the ones is really escrow accounting, because sort of like when we talk about ROE investigations, these SSR agreements they were actually multiple agreements and they covered multiple periods. I think they go back as far as February of 2014. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Correct. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And there were actually two agreements over that period and some of these periods, Julien, were covered by escrow accounting, so you were actually required by the regulators in Wisconsin to escrow both revenues as well as costs, so both revenues you received under the contract as well as the costs that might be allocated back to our utility through MISO. So what I was really referring to primarily is that those escrow mechanisms that might cover one or both of the periods. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just to be clear, I know this is Feb 14 through Jan 15, but would this have an ongoing impact just to 2016, 2017? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Because, the second SSR agreement, I believe ended in either February or April of 2015. Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : February of 2015. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: February of 2015, so this is all going back, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks for that. Little bit more strategic here. I know last time on the call we kind of discussed storage little bit. Can you elaborate where you stand on that and also in the interim we've seen some of your large-cap peers move more explicitly into the midstream sector, what are your thoughts owning storage in midstream more broadly? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. And I think, well, first off on the storage, we are having conversations with two parties who are owners of storage and we'll see what we can work out with one of those, but we are having active conversations with two parties so let me just sort of put a line under that. And then looking forward, I guess our view would be on midstream, at least our view is that we would only be interested in these other natural gas assets and I'll just call them, I don't know whether to call them midstream or what to call them, Julien, but it's certainly upstream of the local gas distribution companies. Our only interest at this point would be in gas storage and it would be gas storage that we could in effect directly integrate with our local distribution company and place in rate base. So at this point, that's as far upstream as we're thinking, it's something that would be very much of another regulated asset play. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right, great. Well, thank you. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Brian. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Just curious, what was the second quarter 2016 EPS impact versus normal? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of weather impact. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Scott, do you want to cover that? Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The weather impact compared to normal, was about I think \u2013 all right, let me just pull our numbers up here. I think it was really only about $0.01. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, then I guess, the delta between what you actually reported and what you had guided to last quarter, is attributable to cost controls and the tech acquisition that's exceeding our expectations? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Initially as you recall on the first in April, it actually was a negative when we had the conference call, so we had earnings we thought were actually going to be down a little bit because of our April weather, and then as we covered then in the last part of the quarter here, so that helped us, so we had projected in our guidance a decline because of weather and then it turned round a little bit in the last part of the quarter here. And plus, we do have pretty good cost control and we saw some of our NIM decline a little bit. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you. Okay. And then, in prior discussions you've mentioned that the people with gas pipeline replacement program has kind of physically maxed out on an annual basis, meaning just manpower or the amount of the street close at one time, et cetera. Can you comment on any of your other subsidiaries that have upside or headroom in some of their programs that can maybe fill in some of that CapEx that you're contemplating? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and then maybe just to give a little bit, if you look at, we talked about gas storage and that's certainly if we made that kind of investment, we would see that being rate base for the two or really three Wisconsin local distribution companies. Outside of Wisconsin we would see quite a bit of opportunity in, let's say, at Minnesota, at Merck, Michigan, at MGU, those companies don't have automated meter. So, we could certainly \u2013 that would be a very cost effective investment that we can make at those two companies. Anything you'd add Scott? Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and remember what we added was really in 2015 and 2016 so maybe some of those programs that we already have, some of that can continue into 2017 through 2018 and 2019 timeframe, but we're still evaluating those, what we have in that 2016, 2017 range. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And are you in a position to quantify maybe the gas reserve opportunity or the automated meters? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The automated meters, they're probably on the range of $30 million to $40 million I would say, at each of the companies. The gas storage, that's completely dependent, Brian on how many Bcf you could buy at what price. So, I'd hesitate to put a number yet on the gas storage, but as I mentioned we are having discussions. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Allen. Couple of easy questions for you. First, how do you \u2013 you've got $35 million roughly, maybe a little less because of the capitalization of pension O&M headwind. You have the headwind tied to 50 basis point, 60 basis point lower ROE at ATC. Is your O&M, and you don't have rate increases coming at the Wisconsin utilities. Are your O&M cost savings enough to offset all of those things? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I believe so, but I would say at the Wisconsin utilities you're probably looking at having to have absolute declines in the O&M run rate. So, Scott, anything you'd like to add? Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. No, that's exactly the case. We'll have to continue at our cost control and manage every dollar like we have in the past. We'll also look at what we do on our financing cost, and we've put in there, maybe there is some investments we need to do in the pension plan also. So, we're evaluating a lot of different items items. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But at this point, Michael, I would say that we still would have enough degrees of freedom that \u2013 so we could move to help offset this. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And O&M sequentially, meaning quarter-over-quarter, because the year-over-year is just complex given the merger close. Quarter-over-quarter was down $5 million, $6 million. Is that kind of a decent run rate to think about the amount of O&M reduction you can take out in a certain period? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, there's a lot of variables between the first quarter and second quarter. For example, the riders we have in Illinois, the riders from Illinois, it's about $10 million more expense in the first quarter than in the second quarter. So, there's some timing of those type of non-controllable O&M that I would not say that's a constant run rate that's going to come out quarter-over-quarter. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. I have a question about 2016 guidance. If I take the midpoint of your guidance, so let's say $2.91. And then I take the midpoint of your third quarter guidance, so $0.57. And then I take what you've actually done year-to-date, so $0.57 in this period and $1.09 in the first period. That implies $0.68 for the fourth quarter, I mean, it's just subtraction. You did $0.66 last year in the fourth quarter, but last year, correct me if I'm wrong, you didn't have that much time or the benefit of the O&M savings, and you also had a little bit of an abnormally warm winter in the fourth quarter of last year, and you've become much more of a gas utility. Can you talk to me about what headwinds you may be facing in the fourth quarter of this year? Just because you're really implying really low growth year-over-year fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2016. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Michael, I'm going to let Scott sort of fill in more of the number detail. But I think basically right now, we're being conservative about weather in the fourth quarter, and Scott talked about we've got much more of our earnings better in the first quarter and the fourth quarter because of the natural gas companies. Obviously, those are weather sensitive. So we're being conservative about weather. And as you pointed out, even on the base that we had before without the Integrys companies, you could have some big swings based on weather. You want to fill in a little bit of detail on that, Scott? Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure. When you look at the weather, specifically in the fourth quarter, and look at scenario now with the larger gas footprint, there is with a warmer fourth quarter potential of $0.08 to $0.09 hit in the fourth quarter related to weather. So we're just being very \u2013 making sure we can measure and manage into that fourth quarter. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But I want to make sure I understand that. Are you implying that your base plan and your base cost guidance assumes abnormal weather? Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, the guidance assumes normal weather, but I'm committed to meeting that range regardless of what happens with weather in the fourth quarter, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. I'll follow-up offline. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it. Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, that concludes our conference call. Thank you for participating. If you have any more questions, contact Beth Straka or Colleen Henderson. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Allen Leverett : Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, finally, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. So with that let's start with our third quarter 2016 results. We reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.69 per share, that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger related costs. The weather here in Southeastern Wisconsin was the second warmest in 84 years. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.  In addition to our third quarter earnings we have two positive developments to share with you. First we reached an uncontested settlement with the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan attorney general and other interveners to form a Michigan only utility. This utility will be named the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Company or UMERC for short. We expect UMERC will provide electric and natural gas service to current customers of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At this point we believe UMERC will begin operations on January 1 of next year. The formation of UMERC is another step that is required to allow us to begin a certificate of necessity proceeding for our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  We are proposing a $255 million investment in 170 megawatts of natural gas fired generation. UMERC would own and operate the reciprocating internal combustion engines which would provide a long term generation solution for reliable and low cost power for customers in the upper peninsula, including the mines owned by Cliffs Resources.  Now we expect to file our proposal with the Michigan commission in November and we're targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after we expect to be in a position to retire our coal fired Presque Isle power plant.  The second positive development relates to our earnings outlook. Based on the positive third quarter results largely driven by weather, we now expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Now we only had one ongoing rate case this year. This was our Minnesota gas utilities rate case, very recently received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase is approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million. And this is in line with our expectations for the case. Early next year we will evaluate our rate case plans for all of our utilities. Next, I want to mention a recent development at the FERC level which impacts our earnings at ATC. On September 28, FERC voted to affirm a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base ROE in the first MISO ROE complaint. Effective January 2015, we qualified for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member increasing our ROE to 10.82%. The resolution of this first complaint for the period from November of 2013 through February 11 of 2015 resulted in an increase in pretax earnings of approximately $1.4 million. Looking ahead we expect an order in the second quarter of 2017 in the second MISO complaint case where the ALJ recommended a base ROE of 9.7%. Again we qualify for the 50 basis point adder which would increase the recommended ROE to 10.2%. We believe this is an appropriate assumption going forward.  Now a reminder on our dividend. In January of this year our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 per share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are in this range now I expect our dividend growth will be in line with our earnings per share growth.  Finally I want to review our updated five year capital forecast. This plan now reflects a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion which is $1.6 billion more than the plan we presented at EEI last November. This plan does not include a potential natural gas storage investment that we are continuing to pursue. I would also remind you that these figures do not include ATC\u2019s capital spending plan.  In addition to the project outlined for you earlier we have continued to identify the need for infrastructure improvements, including our gas facilities in Chicago. We have included updated five year capital investment forecast charts in the back of the earnings package.  Now with details on our third quarter results and a financial outlook, here is our chief financial officer Scott Lauber. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies. Excluding one set of acquisition costs in 2016 adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 from $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015 to $0.69 per share in the third quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter last year. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 third quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.  First I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring page ten of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the third quarter adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $402.5 million as compared to $351.8 million in 2015, an increase of $50.7 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the third quarter totaled $299.1 million for 2016, an increase of $42.5 million from the third quarter of 2015. The improved quarter over quarter results for the Wisconsin segment was driven primarily by significantly warmer than normal weather and timing of positive fuel recoveries.  In the third quarter of 2016 our Illinois segment had $11.7 million of operating income, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the $3.5 million of operating income recognized during the 2015 third quarter. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by continuing investment in the gas system modernization program. Operating income for our other states segment improved $2.7 million in part due to cost controls. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $500,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investments at our Power the Future plan. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $1 million this quarter compared to an adjusted operating income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. Taking the changes of these segments together we arrived at $50.7 million increase in adjusted operating income.  During the third quarter of 2016 earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the same quarter last year. The lower equity earnings were driven by the recent FERC order and ALJ recommendations related to the ATC ROE reviews. Our other income net decreased by $3.6 million largely related to lower AFUDC which was caused primarily by timing of capital expenditures. Our net interest expense decreased $4.1 million, interest expense decreased quarter over quarter primarily as a result of the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes earlier this year. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short term debt. Increased quarter over quarter operating income was the primary driver for the $15.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all these items it brings us to adjust to the earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $185 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2015. On a year to date basis, GAAP earnings were $2.35 per share compared with $1.78 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.03 per share in 2015 to $2.36 per share in 2016. Year to date results in 2016 include the impacts of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 year to date results include only one quarter of Integrys earnings. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $647.5 million during the first nine months of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by $526 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by decreasing contributions to employee benefit plans. As previously discussed we contribute $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016.  Our capital expenditures totaled $1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $208.3 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was related to capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our debt to capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of September, an increase from the 50.1% adjusted debt to capital ratio reported at the end of June. Effective at the end of the third quarter we no longer are adjusting equity for any portion of the legacy Integrys hybrid instruments. Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 series A junior subordinate notes at common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any additional shares.  We also paid $468.6 million in common dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $157.7 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition sectors and an increase in the dividend rate compared to the first nine months of 2015. Since the beginning of 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend 17.2% from $0.4225 per share to the current level of $0.495 per share. Moving to sales, we continued to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7000 more electric customers and nearly 13,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are serving approximately 18,000 more customers compared to a year ago. Now let's discuss delivered volumes. For comparative purposes year to date electric volume information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather normalized deliveries are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Actual third quarter retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 4.1%. On a weather normalized basis retail deliveries of electricity were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015. Looking at the individual customer segments, actual residential deliveries rose 8.1% while weather normalized residential deliveries decreased five-tenths of 1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, actual deliveries increased 3.6% while weather normalized quarterly deliveries increased seven-tenths of 1%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2016 increased 2.2%. Excluding the iron ore mine, large commercial industrial deliveries increased eight-tenths of 1%. We see continued improvement in several important sectors of Wisconsin\u2019s economy, including paper and paper products, food processing and chemical processing. Year to date weather normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased three-tenths of 1%.  Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year to date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas use for power generation, decreased 3% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to warmer weather. On a weather normalized basis, year to date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas use for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations.  Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. The guidance excludes a $0.01 per share of acquisition related costs in the third quarter as well as any potential acquisition related cost that may arise during the fourth quarter. This projection assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and reflects the mild first quarter weather as well as a very warm third quarter weather conditions. A couple of key points as we look at the annual guidance. First, the very warm weather in the third quarter was mainly in southeatern Wisconsin and the majority of the weather related margins and positive fuel recoveries were in the Wisconsin electric service territory. This was a benefit to Wisconsin electric in the third quarter of about $0.08. As you recall Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin gas have an earning sharing mechanism in place as part of the acquisition order and therefore limit the overall earnings potential for the year. In addition we expect an increase in maintenance expense items in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Again we expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share guidance range.  With that, I will turn things back to Allen. Allen Leverett : Thank you, Scott. Now before we take your questions I want to take a moment to thank Colleen Henderson for her 21 years of dedicated service to the company. Now it's been my pleasure to work with Colleen for thirteen of these twenty one years. Colleen will be retiring from the company in January. Colleen has been our primary contact with all of you as well as the other members of the investment community. She leaves a legacy of what I believe is one of the best investor relations programs in our industry. So please join me in wishing Colleen a long happy and healthy retirement. Operator we\u2019re ready for the question and answer portion of our conference call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : I wanted to say congratulations as well to Colleen, you will be missed. Colleen Henderson : Thank you. Greg Gordon : Gosh, I think you have been doing this since I was in diapers in this business and I \u2013 so congratulations on that. Greg Gordon : I do have a question on the fourth-quarter earnings and then a question on CapEx. So first, you guys earned -- I think you earned $0.63 in the fourth quarter last year, so if I just do that basic math, if you had a flat year you would be slightly above the high end of the range. Is the reason that you don't expect that to happen because you will be in a refund position on the sharing, or because you have found opportunities to do accelerated expense programs where they benefit customers? Or some combination of both or is there another item that I am not thinking about? Allen Leverett : So let me start, Greg, on the fourth quarter earnings question and then I'll let Scott expand on a couple of points. So you touched on one of the issues which is the sharing mechanism at Wisconsin electric -- let's say sharing mechanism, the earning sharing mechanism at Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin gas and just keep in mind that's about 60% of our regulated utilities, so 60% of our earnings would be subject to that earning sharing mechanism. So we certainly expect that mechanism to kick in and there would be some sharing. In fact, we already accrued some sharing in the third. So that's the first factor that will impact, we expect it will impact the fourth quarter, you touched on that.  The other thing, Greg, that I would just emphasize and Scott talked about this a little bit in his remarks but remember the electric fuel recovering mechanisms that we have at Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin public service, they have a dead-band, so in dollar terms it's a plus or minus $15 million at Wisconsin electric. It's a plus or minus $6 million at Wisconsin public service. And so once you get above those positive recovery levels, all of the dollars go, dollar for dollar above that level back to refunds for customers. Unlike the third quarter of last year we actually went all the way to the top of those bands in the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of last year we had to get well into the fourth quarter before we hit those -- before we hit those levels. So that also introduced another timing difference or earnings timing difference if you will in third quarter as opposed to fourth.  And the last thing is related to O&M spend. And what really happened, Greg, seems like every quarter we talk a lot about the weather but in the fourth quarter of 2015 that was a very mild weather quarter and as a result in order to hit the financial commitments we had, we actually had to cut back a bit on O&M spending. So I view the O&M spend run rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 is being a little abnormal, meaning abnormally low. What I think we'll see in the fourth quarter this year is more of a normal run rate for the business the way it's configured now. So I think those three factors, the earning sharing mechanisms, hitting the top of the positive recovery bands on the fuel in the third quarter and finally that difference in O&M timing, I think all of those will impact the fourth quarter. I don't know Scott if you want to spend any time at all on the sharing mechanisms. Scott Lauber : Yes, we can just cover that just a little bit, so at Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin gas at the sharing mechanism and remember there is an authorizer allowed return in Wisconsin electric of about 10.2% ROE and then we share the first 50 basis points above that. So we can directly earn up to the 10.45 and then anything above that or the sharing part of that will be used to basically amortize some of the transmission assets that we have on our balance sheet, that was part of the acquisition order. So that part of the sharing mechanism that will happen as we look at the fourth quarter again and tie it all together.  As we look at the earnings in the fourth quarter last year, you factor in the interest expense that fell [$0.62] on a comparable basis and the fuel that Allen talked about, that\u2019s about $0.03, so you get down to that $0.59 and the O&M getting back to a normal run rate, and maintenance is about $0.02 to $0.03. so it gets into that $0.57, $0.59 range. Allen Leverett : But Greg, I think you had a question on capital. Greg Gordon : Yes, so you did mention it in your comments at the opening of the call. Can you talk a little bit more about specifically what kind of projects you have identified? I think at this point you have pretty much fully offset the $1 billion impact of bonus depreciation from the tax package that was passed last December. And I think you have even, if I count increases in the 2019 and 2020 CapEx forecast, have now basically gotten back into the sort of positive territory on total rate base additions relative to the impact of bonus. So can you talk about where you are in your thought process on updating your CapEx? You said there was still, a) what are the things that you have put into the plan that you think are beneficial for customers? And, b), what is still being -- you talk about I think at least one type of capital program that is still under consideration that hasn't been rolled out yet? Allen Leverett : Well, in terms of the way the numbers break down, so overall if we look at our five year capital plan, it\u2019s about $1.6 billion more than the plan that was laid out in November of 2015 at EEI. So you're exactly right, Greg, it would offset the billion -- roughly $1 billion tax impact to bonus depreciation, plus another say $550 million on top of that. So just to give you a sense for the types of things, Greg, that are in $1.6 billion. So we alluded to one of them in the call. So there is $255 million for the generation in Michigan. I certainly see that as a benefit to the customers in the UP and also a benefit to customers in Wisconsin because once we retire Presque Isle there will be about a $40 million O&M savings associated with retirement plan. Also in the generation category we've made the assumption. We also expect that as soon as we can or we're allowed to by MISO we want to proceed to retire the Pulliam plant which is a coal plant at the Green Bay Area and that will leave a generation need in Wisconsin public service and we will have an option to invest. We have a generation option at the Riverside power plant that Alliant is building, that's about $100 million, so exercise on that first option.  On the electric distribution side, I think we've talked before about the system modernization reliability program in the Wisconsin public service territory. So we're going to finish the first phase and do a second phase that will be about $100 million. That's a very popular program, we've seen a quite significant reliability benefit for the distribution customers in Wisconsin public service.  On the gas distribution side, just to give you one example. I'm sure you and the other listeners on the call are very familiar with what's going on with FEMSA and the new rules that are coming on gas storage. We believe we\u2019re going to require about a $50 million program at the Manlove storage field in Illinois to do well workovers and put in the subsurface safety valves. So that's another $50 million. And then just to give you a couple of other examples. A number of software projects that we believe are going result in O&M savings. So short cycle work management system in Illinois. We're also going to move the automated meters at our Michigan gas utility as well as our Minnesota gas utility. So as you can tell from that litany, I mean there is quite a number of things that are in that list. And I believe, our team believes that they'll all be beneficial to customers either from a cost standpoint or reliability or both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Just briefly, the higher capital plan for Illinois, will that be just recovered the same way it\u2019s been done under the legislation for the gas system? Allen Leverett : Well at this point, Steve, I would expect that the roughly $50 million for the storage field that we would do that under traditional regulation as opposed to using a rider mechanism. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Colleen, our best wishes as well. Thank you for all your help over the years. Colleen Henderson : Thank you very much, Jonathan. Say thanks to Caroline too. Jonathan Arnold : She joins me in those wishes. So just quickly on -- you gave a number I think of $0.08 of weather in the quarter in the prepared remarks. I was just curious whether that was net of any of the accrued sharing that you had in the quarter or just could we break that down a little further? Scott Lauber : Sure, the $0.08 in Wisconsin electric is really just looking at the margins itself and the fuel recovery, so there's about $0.03 positive fuel recoveries in the third quarter, that wasn\u2019t really expected usually like Allen said was in the fourth quarter. In addition, the other $0.05 was the weather margin related in Wisconsin electric\u2019s territory. The warm weather in Wisconsin was -- across the state but mainly that southeatern Wisconsin was about 50% warmer than normal, so quite an extreme warm weather over the quarter. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you for that. And then I guess I think Greg got most of my other things, but just may I ask what should we anticipate incrementally at least in broad terms from you guys at EEI in a week or so? Allen Leverett : Well I think in terms of the broad numbers you have them. So in terms of the capital forecast we've laid that out today. I think Scott and Beth and Colleen will be prepared to lay out -- give you further detail behind those numbers. But in terms of the broad numbers you have them, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : So just more fleshing out the details on the CapEx, etc.? Allen Leverett : That's exactly right, Jonathan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Congratulations, Colleen, you will definitely be missed and I am sure that \u2013 Colleen Henderson : Thank you very much. Michael Weinstein : Looking forward to working with Beth again closer and everything so it will be great. In terms of the CapEx plan, are you -- what can you say about the longer-term 5% to 7% growth rate post 2016 and the impact of it on that? Allen Leverett : And I think if you take -- and I think it's important to mention this on the call that if you take the capital that I talked about for the retail utilities, plus the capital plan for ATC, we view that as being supportive of the 5% to 7% range level. Michael Weinstein : Okay, so within and supportive. Allen Leverett : Correct. Michael Weinstein : Are you going to be updating the 10-year capital projection plan at EEI or --? Scott Lauber : Yeah we're pulling that together right now working with the operations and the president just to lay out the remaining five years of that plan. So we will have something at EEI. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Congrats on a great quarter and year to date. One question, if I look at the year to date numbers in the earnings packet, one of the things that doesn't really stand out a lot is the impact of O&M, right. So when you give kind of the small verbal not verbal -- the small written descriptions on page 11 of what the contribution at each segment to potentially lower O&M. It\u2019s actually not that big of a number and that strikes me just at first glance a little bit surprising given you are not even a year and a half post merger. I'm just curious, is that being embedded somewhere else or are you not seeing much in the way of O&M reductions post Integrys? I'm trying to just think this through a little bit. Scott Lauber : Yeah, I mean there is some O&M sprinkled throughout so we are seeing O&M and all the other segments, Wisconsin, Illinois, the other states, and remember Allen talked about some of the sharing mechanisms and that we've booked a little bit in the quarter about $18 million, that is actually an acceleration of transmission cost, so that is buried in that O&M number. Michael Lapides : And is that a - that $18 million, is that all you have taken for the year so far or was there any taken in the first half? Scott Lauber : No, that's all that\u2019s taken for the year and of course, that all depends upon the fourth quarter. Michael Lapides : One other thing. If I think about what is kind of going on in the various businesses, and I know you updated capital spending, but your CapEx outlook at ATC kind of has a little bit of a mini cliff, meaning CapEx is elevated and then and in another year, year and a half from now it kind of declines significantly down to the $400 million level or so at the ATC consolidated level. Do you still see that happening? Do you see anything in the horizon that could drive much of an uptick at ATC that could kind of fill that? Or do you just simply expect ATC growth to slow down a bit? Allen Leverett : Let me let me maybe talk about that Michael in two pieces. So inside the footprint, when I say inside the footprint, that would be inside Wisconsin and the UP, Michigan. I mean you're right you're going to see or we expect to see somewhat of a deceleration or lowering in the spending at ATC. However if you look at the ten year numbers, the last cycle when they updated their ten year outlook, it was 3.7 to 4.5. This cycle is 3.6 to 4.4. So if you look over a ten year period, the ten year numbers aren't that different. But in terms of the annual averages those are -- I would expect they're going to come down somewhat, Michel, because they're very very large, very very significant reliability projects inside the footprint, a lot of those are done.  Now as perhaps the generation patterns change in the state because of clean power plan, perhaps you could see an uptick again but right now we expect it to come down somewhat. So that\u2019s the inside the footprint. Outside the footprint, we're certainly pursuing other investments and we talked about on previous calls, we talked about that a little bit. So that's one of the reasons why a number of years ago because of what we saw coming with inside the plant, why we want to start pursuing something outside of Wisconsin and Michigan. Michael Lapides : One last question, how are you thinking -- and I know you said in your prepared remarks that you will give a little bit of an update on this on the fourth-quarter call. But just curious about your thoughts on whether you would file cases in Wisconsin. And I guess a little bit of my question is more of a legal or regulatory one. Do you have to file a case in Wisconsin next year or if you don't feel the need you can stay out for another year or so? Allen Leverett : Well I think from a practical standpoint and let\u2019s just put the legalities aside, I think from a practical standpoint Michael, anything we do whether we would decide to file or not to file, we would want to reach agreement with the commission staff about that. So just putting legalities aside, I think whatever we do whichever one of those paths we go down, we would want to do that with the agreement of the staff. And then just to reiterate what I was saying earlier in the call we would start having those conversations early in the new year with the staff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : I don't know if you went over this, but what was the refund in the third quarter? And what do you expect in the fourth quarter assuming normal weather? Allen Leverett : Well there were no refunds. What we did, Paul, just to be clear is we accrued under the sharing mechanism, we accrued $18 million pretax in the third quarter and then based upon the fourth quarter results you get to a final number, that 18 could increase, it could decrease, because the accounting period you look at for sharing with the calendar year. Scott Lauber : Yeah there's really not a refund. It's really just paying down of regulatory asset or reducing a future rate increase. So that was going to get cash back to customers, we will be able to reduce or not increase rates in the future related to it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Thanks so much for your help over the years. Let me just circle back on the gas CapEx numbers. Was it right to understand that about $50 million is the amount that won't be going through the -- it will be more of a traditional sort of rate case approach, is that right? Allen Leverett : No, and let me just sort of clarify to make sure everybody understands. So I expect next year if you look at the system modernization program, this would be basically the replacement of the cast iron mains to meters what not, but that will be nearly $300 million of spending in 2017. And that will go going back to Steve Fleishman\u2019s question, that $300 million will go through the QIP rider. In addition to that I expect that we're going to have to spend $50 million on the safety related things at the Manlove field. That $50 million, Paul, I think it spreads out over three or four years but they're spread out a few years but at this point I would not expect to put that $50 million to the QIP rider. Paul Patterson : And then the other amount is -- I mean let me ask you this. So the increase that we see over what you guys had in September was like $130 million is about -- the $50 million, annually speaking that is, I don't know, that\u2019s over several years, so that\u2019s only part of it. And the other amount, is it the AMRP that\u2019s -- what is the incremental difference I guess from what you guys \u2013 Scott Lauber : The other part is a variety of different items and like Allen said those items I mean it ranges from additional infrastructure work to the meters that are outside of the footprint, also some software in there. So that those there do not go through the rider. However we you have depreciation in an ongoing basis and that's really filling in some of that normal depreciation in the area. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then there was I guess a filing regarding methane mapping that I think covers [ph] is suggesting would substantially increase the efficiency of this AMR -- this accelerated main replacement program. So do you have any comments on that or I mean is that any -- do you guys -- what do you guys think about that? Allen Leverett : Well just to be clear this is related to methane leaks on the gas distribution system in Chicago. And my understanding of the approach that the team uses there is prioritized projects, it already takes into account leak rates -- methane leak rates. So there's already the attempt built into that process, that variable if you will and trying to reduce methane leaks. So I would view that we're already trying to address that in a way we do the prioritization. Certainly if there's a better more precise way to factor that into the process, that's certainly something we can consider that it's already being considered in the current prioritization process. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then there was this -- in Michigan there is discussion of increasing transmission with Ontario. And they see that as a potential to lower rates and what have you. And I was just wondering is there any opportunity there or any impact associated with -- do you guys have any thoughts about that? I think it is the Upper Peninsula that they are talking about. Any thoughts about that or any color on that? Allen Leverett : Yeah, not a lot of color but I could give you, Paul, and my understanding that this would be a study that the state government there would kick off and look at the feasibility of that and what would it cost et cetera but not any real color that I can get around that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Andy Levi : Colleen, 20 years I think, right? 25, how long have you been IR? Colleen Henderson : 21. Andy Levi : 21, okay 21 years. 21 years, okay. I've been doing this longer than you, pretty scary. But thank you for everything, Colleen. You've always been very good to me. So I will never -- it is not forgotten, I appreciate it. And then most of my questions were answered. I just have two questions. Just Allen in general, obviously you added a lot of CapEx, you filled everything in, it\u2019s like $1.9 billion a year. Any reason to think as you get more comfortable in 2017 that the growth rate could go higher? Allen Leverett : Well I think as I look at the capital spending and in response to one of the previous questions, we certainly view that what we put on the table for retail CapEx in the retail utilities, what ATC has put on the table for the inside the footprint we all view that as being supportive of the earnings per share guidance range. The way I would answer your question, Andy, actually to kick ourselves in that range, we're going to need to be able to be successful with some of these transmission developments outside of the traditional footprint at ATC. So I think if I certainly saw a significant way, some successes outside the footprint at ATC, that would certainly give me some comfort to put your forecast above but still within that 5% to 7% range. Andy Levi : Because the $1.9 billion or plus year seems much higher than what it was when you originally came out with the growth rate. And then so by the time you got to like \u201819 or \u201820 it adds a couple cents, a couple cents, a couple cents every year. Allen Leverett : Go ahead. Andy Levi : No, no, no, so I was just kind of doing some dumb math which I am really good at. And -- emphasizing the dumb part -- Go ahead. Allen Leverett : I think you should keep in mind, Andy, one of the areas -- remember we had this additional bonus depreciation was kind of in in the middle here, so that was a $1 billion cash tax impact. The other thing that perhaps people don't talk about quite as much, since we talked about a 5% to 7% earnings per share growth range we've seen allowed rates of return, most notably the allowed rate of returns FERC go down. So there's sort of then some puts and takes. Certainly there have been some increases in our projected level of capital spending, those are the puts and takes. We certainly had bonus appreciation and some reduction in allowed rate of return. Andy Levi : That explains that. And then the last question I had is around Point Beach. And how does the contract [indiscernible] NextEra? Does the contract start to -- does it start to increase I guess in price next year? Is that how it works? Allen Leverett : Yeah, and then so maybe sort of go back because a lot of people may not have the history with the Point Beach with the PPA and the sale of the asset, just and I'm sure you remember, Andy, but for the benefit of others, on the call, so back in -- actually December of 2006 we announced the sale of the plant and some associated PPAs with NextEra. We went through a very protracted contested case proceeding in Wisconsin leading up to the actual financial closing of the sale in 2007.  Now during that protracted prolonged contested case proceeding the commission approved not only the sale of the nuclear plant, the two units, so the both of the units but they also reviewed and approved the PPAs and there were refunds of the above book and the proceeds that we got above book for the plant as well as the excess nuclear decommissioning funds that were in the trust. So the PPA as well as the sale, all were reviewed in that proceeding. And then ever since then these PPP payments have been consistently recovered in the fuel costs. So I think all that background, all that context is important, and I think Scott, maybe you could fill in \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t have if we have the specific numbers in terms of at least the next two years what happens with -- I don't have them handy. Scott Lauber : Yeah. So they increase slightly in \u201917 and \u201918 about 1% and that's a like \u201919 or \u201920 that we start going up at 6% rate. Andy Levi : So beginning in 2019 rates start to increase 6% to 7% a year, but it is not until \u201819. So there is no issue in \u201817 or \u201818 as far as what you file and having to worry about I guess not rate fatigue but rates going up too fast. So in \u201819 when you have the 6% to 7% increase, and that goes over like a 10-year period, right, where the rates increase every year 6% or 7% beginning in \u201819, is that right? Allen Leverett : Yes. Andy Levi : So with that being the case, on a -- I guess just for the Wisconsin -- the legacy customer, right? Obviously not for the Integrys customer. But for that portion that goes up beginning in \u201819 what is that as far as an overall rate increase? Because it's obviously just a portion of your total generation. Would you be able to figure that out? Is that a number that you know? Allen Leverett : Well as we get to 2019, so the figures that Scott talked about, if you do it in a total rate, if you look at it in total rates, my recollection is, it\u2019s about 1.25% somewhere in that range, 1.25% uplift on total rates. Andy Levi : That should actually -- because that's actually I guess probably the only question I should have asked because that was more than I wanted to know. Okay. Well, thank you very much and I will see you guys in a week. Colleen, bon voyage, enjoy. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Real quick, Scott, the increase in CapEx, should we assume there is a pro forma increase therefore in the benefit you will get an bonus D&A? Kind of just thinking about it pro rata that whatever bonus D&A assumptions are they go up by a little bit of the percent change in CapEx that you are increasing by? Scott Lauber : Correct. So the bonus appreciation is through 2019 and the new additional CapEx would qualify for the bonus. Michael Lapides : So what were you all saying bonus D&A was and what do you think it will be now? I am just trying to think about the cash flow impact for you. Scott Lauber : Yeah. So when you look at $1 billion was with the original plan. I'm sure it's a couple hundred million more, will probably be a cash tax payer in like 2018. End of Q&A Allen Leverett : Okay. Well thank you very much for your questions. That concludes our conference call for this afternoon. Certainly if you have any more questions please contact Beth Straka or Colleen Henderson 404-221-3592. Thank you.",

Analysts: Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment. Now, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 5% to 7% off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. In addition to our full-year results, we have two other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan. This facility can provide approximately one-third of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the Commission to confirm that is reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. We chose the service agreement structure for two reasons. First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission in the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business. The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed for required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation or UMERC for short. UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment in about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable cost-effective long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources. We are targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduce carbon emissions. Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had one rate case. Now, this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million in line with our expectation. I also expect we will have another quite year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that we'll put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016. Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%, and we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipating transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan. Now, a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. I would now like to provide you with an update on our five-year capital forecast. Our five-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last five-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint. We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership known as ATC Southwest will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States. Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have three common elements, reducing the corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and eliminating interest expense of the deduction. These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first, and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment. First let's look at the regulated utilities because of the traditional rate-making approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized. The second element, 100% expensing of capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact. The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders. So, We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward. The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power, if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown if this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expenses. In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks or leasing entities. From the shareholders' perspective, there are three key issues, the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base, and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level. The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and non-deductibility of interest would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a five-year period. On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments. Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although, this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it takes shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed. So now with details on our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Allen. In 2016, our GAAP earnings grew $2.96 per share from $2.34 per share in 2015. Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include two quarters of Integrys earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing, and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys results for the first two quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. Referring to page 11 of the earnings package, our consolidated operating income for 2016 adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $1.6856 billion as compared to $1.3581 billion in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1.027 billion for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first two quarters of 2016, with remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense. Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 included $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016 and will last for three years. Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers, all earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers. In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first two quarters of 2016, and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program. In 2016, our other states segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $34.1 million during the first two quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan Gas Utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016, compared to the adjusted operating income of $800,000 in 2015. Lower operating income was driven in part by $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first two quarters of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. During 2016, earning from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year. Integrys results for the first two quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leaving a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015, related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016. Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys companies contributed $38.1 million of other income during the first two quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys Transportation Fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys Transportation Fuels was sold in the first quarter of 2016. Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first two quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% Junior Notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt. Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first two quarters of 2016 drove the $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016, compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust. Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full-year of capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of a $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015. Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago. Now, let's discuss delivered sales volume year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail electricity deliveries excluding the iron ore mines increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 0.2% compared to 2015. Looking at the individual customer segments, actual residential deliveries rose 4.1%, while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 0.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3%, while weather-normalized deliveries increased 0.9%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year. Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation were up 3.7% compared to 2015. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. For 2017, we'll forecast and discuss delivered results for the State of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 0.2% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine. Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 0.2%, impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 0.5%. In the large commercial and industrial group excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 0.5%. Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentions, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7% of a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which was offset by fuel recoveries. In addition, there was a $0.04 pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase, a portion of the Integrys 6.11% Junior Notes. Taking these into account and a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share. With that, I will turn things back to Allen. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. Operator : Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Looking at 2017, looking at your margin walk, you had $38.9 million of margin in 2016 from weather, but then in excess of the earnings sharing mechanism, you also had a $33.4 million increase in O&M. So, as you think about 2017 in a normal weather scenario, should we be thinking about your ability to modulate O&M in order to still earn close to or at your targeted allowed return? And what are the factors that are sort of the puts and takes that get you into sort of a confidence range around a normal weather, meaning you can earn your authorized return? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Good question, Greg. And I think maybe I'll just answer the question. It's kind of at a summary high level. The plan that we put together for 2017 would call for us to reduce O&M. So if you look at the 2016 run rate, the run rate in 2017 would be 3% below the level that it was at in 2016. Now, in addition to that Greg, as we have always done in previous years, weather is obviously uncertain, could be better or worse than normal, so we certainly have levers if you will above and below that 3% level, so that we can adjust our operations as we see weather that's either favorable or unfavorable. But the base plan would call for a 3% reduction in the level of O&M. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. What is the timeline for you engaging with the Public Service Commission and making a decision to either file for a general rate case this year, or decide mutually to defer that for another year? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think you're referring to the Wisconsin Commission, and we... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: ...began engaging with their staff right after the holiday. So the first week of January, we started having discussions with them. In terms of a likely timetable, Greg, my view at this point would be, from traditionally if you're going to file a case, you're filing kind of the mid-to-late April, early May sort of timeframe. So, I think we certainly need to come to a resolution before, say, that mid-April timeframe. And I think we're on track to either be able to file a case although we don't think that's the best path or to let the mechanism that the Commission put in place continue to operate for at least another year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. My last question is on, your last published slide deck is your January deck and you gave capital spending of 2020. If I start with 2017 averaging about $1.9 billion and then an incremental, your portion of ATC averaging, let's call it around $300 million over the similar timeframe, maybe a little less, the acquisition you're making of the storage fields, that is incremental to that plan or was that incorporated in that plan? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. The storage field will be incremental to that plan. And we'll have the new slide deck out shortly. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So, if you would have added that $200 million into your plan and we're to presume that you're going to earn out your authorized returns across all the jurisdictions and all the investments you're making over this period, where inside the sort of 5% to 7% earnings growth aspiration would you expect to be at this juncture? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. And so, let me bridge back to the capital plan that I'd discussed kind of in the prepared remarks. So, if you take the $9.7 billion, what I would just call the more of the retail business, add the $1.4 billion for ATC inside the footprint and then, put on top of that the $300 million outside the footprint. Greg, I see that getting us kind of more of the low end of that 5% to 7% range. And then, what you'd need to do in order to kind of move up in that range, I'd say most likely would be to make some significant investment outside the footprint, the traditional footprint at ATC. But the capital plan that I described in the prepared remarks, very supportive of something kind of near that low end of the range. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you, guys. Have a great day. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Good. Thank you. Well, perhaps just a follow-up on Greg's question if you may. Can I ask \u2013 you alluded to ATC as being kind of another lever to get you higher up in that range? You also discussed on the call, if I heard right, a new JV effort. Is that something we should be paying attention to in terms of meaningful drivers in the ATC, is that an equation, or what would then ATC would be that prospect, or what geography are we talking about? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. I would say, well, short answer is yes, you should be paying attention, Julien, because I think that Arizona, there are certainly a lot of needs for transmission in Arizona. So, I would say though in terms of most likely places that ATC could do things outside the footprint, Arizona is one of them and then going into the California market, because they're going to be looking. They still have very aggressive renewable goals, and they're going to be looking to import effectively renewable power in the California. So, I think the largest potential opportunities outside footprint are in the West and more likely the North Arizona and California. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That's great. So then, maybe just turning back to the latest acquisition if you will, can you elaborate a little bit further, one, on the specific acquisition you just did, where will that be accounted for if it's outside the utilities, that's just going to be at a holdco kind of figure? And then separately, just to clarify a typical equity ratio, typical ROE on the full 200 and change number that you're acquiring this far. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. I think your description was very good, Julien, but maybe just let me review it for everybody on the call. So, what we would do, Bluewater Holding would be a first here subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We would capitalize at approximately 50% equity, 50% debt. The equity would come from the parent, and then we would issue debt sort of on balance sheet, if you will, non-recourse debt down at that subsidiary. Equity return in the low 10%s is what you typically see right now for the Wisconsin utilities. So that's how we would structure it. And then you would have a collection of three service agreements back from Bluewater Holding, an agreement to each of the three Wisconsin LDCs. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just to clarify, what's the tenure of the contract that we're talking about with between the new gas storage sub and your utilities? I know you guys want to make this utility like, so perhaps just emphasize... Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : ...for us what that profile looks like, what the tenure is, and to what degree have you mitigated the risks. And then maybe let me throw it in while I got the mic here. The last question being, are there incremental opportunities either off of this existing asset that you're acquiring or further acquisition target both in Wisconsin or elsewhere that you would want to scale up this gas storage opportunities efficiently? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. So, let me start with kind of the nature of the service agreements. So, when we'll lay this out in our declaratory ruling request, I mean literally in a matter of days, so we'll include in there the service agreements as we would propose them. In terms of tenure, Julien, we would actually propose 60-year agreements, so very long tenure agreements. And effectively what the agreement would provide for is a return on and of capital that's been invested, including the initial investment, and then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M of course and I think it'd be modest capital but if you had some additional capital that would be required at the field that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism. So, we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling and there will be attachments to that. The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you ask, additional opportunities, I believe in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 bcf in terms of working gas, that's about a third of our requirements. I do believe, you could do some additional expansion at the field and you could add some more working gas at the field. If you did that, that would be also covered by that service agreement, sort of structure that I mentioned. I think other than that for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at. So, hopefully... (39:44) Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. So, it's not that big of an incremental opportunity on the gas storage side, not looking to fully cover your needs, shall we say beyond the... Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, it only covers the third of the needs, so there certainly would be room to do a bit more own storage in the future because it's only a third. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. But at the site principally not necessarily incremental? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That's right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Excellent. Thank you for the time. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the extra color on tax and the detail there. I'm wondering can you \u2013 should we think about that \u2013 you obviously have framed the magnitude of how you see the impact to different pieces. Do you feel that these are within a framework that you would be able to work to offset through other means, be it cost or investment, or is this kind of a net look? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Well, I think maybe I'll talk about in terms of the shareholder impacts. When we talked about rate base, it was a cumulative impact of $300 million on rate base and again that's cumulative over a five-year period. So, I would certainly view that on a company of this size, there certainly would be other opportunities that we could pull forward or identify that would help offset that $300 million. So, I think from a rate base standpoint, I'd certainly think that's manageable. Not much to say about the deferred tax impact at We Power, that would be a shareholder benefit, and that kind of leaves interest deductibility. And I think I would just stress to you Jonathan and everybody on the call, all this that we put into the earnings deck, it's bit of a speculative enterprise, I mean we're just trying to give people a sense for the impacts. On the interest deductibility front, if you take one extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on a base of say circa $3, so that'd be fairly small and I would expect that that's probably manageable. As you start getting the things more like $0.15, that'd be tougher for us to manage. But as I look at it, I mean it's not a foregone conclusion, but that's where they're headed in terms of how this would be structured. Does that help? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that's helpful. Thank you. And my other question was answered. So, I will see you. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Dan. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. I also had a couple questions just around the tax, if the tax law changes, and it's more in terms of your capital structure. I've seen a number of studies saying that as tax rates go down or as tax interest deductibility becomes less of an issue, companies tend to have less leverage. Have you thought at all about any impacts on your capital structure strategy particularly, in terms of how you would capitalize your utilities for rate filings and so forth in terms of debt to equity ratios and so forth? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I've not thought about that a great deal at this point, Dan. But I think look if you basically or Congress makes changes in the tax that effectively changes the after-tax cost of the different components, you'd most certainly have to rethink what's the best capital structure for the utilities. But quite candidly, I haven't gotten to that level yet in my thinking. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then I just want to make sure on your page 18, where you show these preliminary estimates that I understand your note there under the holding company. We were saying that's only a change in rate and not additive so... Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Scott, do you want to take the answer to that? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. And the reason for the note is, if there would be only a change of rate, it would be the $0.05 that we talked about at the holding company. When you go down the holding company page, if non-deductibility of interest would happen, it would be $0.14, so it's not additive. I don't want someone to go and add the $0.05 and $0.14 together, it's either $0.05 or $0.14, which once again, Allen talked about the non-deductibility of interest and where that would actually go. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. So you would use one or the other, but not... Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : They're not netted in anyway. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. I also had a question around debt. I guess, you saw the Bloomberg is changing rules for inclusion of debt issuance in their indices and a large number of your issues are going to fall out of the index given that they are at currently at a size of $250 million. I guess how do you expect to respond to that, while you tend to issue larger sizes going forward or do you think you still have adequate access to the debt markets if you issue at $250 million or have you thought about that? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, that's a good question. And we'll be looking at as debt issuances come due. Probably we'll look at it in a couple of ways. One, there may be an opportunity to open some of the existing debt and get it at that larger level, so keep it at the index level. We will also look at, should we issue in larger amounts and maybe have to look at our CP program overall. But we've been very successful at the smaller utilities, even issue under the index size debt. So we've been successful either way. But we'll evaluate them as they come due and what's the most efficient to execute them. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then the last question I had is around the numbers on page 10 and 11. You had fairly sizable impacts in Wisconsin related to O&M that even after excluding the earning sharing. I was wondering if you could give some more color on what happened there in the fourth quarter in particular. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. In order to really look at the fourth quarter O&M, you really have to take a step back to 2015. So in 2015 as you recall, we had an extremely warm fourth quarter, and in that fourth quarter, we had to really look at our O&M expenses. And in the end, we had to control O&M expenses to get to our authorized return. And when you look at this year, we're just getting back to running the normal O&M in the projects that we were doing. There may be some timing between the third and fourth quarter, but we've really looked at the total expense over the entire year. So, there is a little more O&M, specifically in this fourth quarter, but it was exaggerated by what we did last year in 2015. But overall, we're able to hit our authorized return in all the jurisdictions. And like Allen mentioned, next year, we're looking about 3% reduction in total O&M. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Thank you. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Zhou (48:00) with Avon Advisors (sic) [Avon Capital]. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: (48:04) Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Thank you, guys. Hey. No, it's actually Andy Levi. How are you? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hey, Andy. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : I had a question on the growth rate, but I think you guys were very clear on that. So I'm all set. Thank you very much. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. I'm actually going to pick up where Andy just left off. Can you talk about how many \u2013 I know you're talking about 3% O&M down in the 2017 over 2016, so 2016 O&M was almost $2.2 billion. So, that's a pretty sizable chunk of O&M reduction. Do you see multiple years of this? I mean we've seen some of your peers go to mergers. One of the East Coast utilities did an acquisition or did a merger with a peer and they've been able to do four or five years of 2% to 3% O&M reductions. Just curious if you see that kind of runway ahead for cost saves, that would benefit both shareholders and other stakeholders including customers? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Well, I think in terms of being able to continue to maintain O&M reductions, I do believe we'll have additional capacity to reduce O&M, Michael. But I would say, as you look out say to 2018, 2019, 2020, which I think is kind of more where you're going, the larger reductions in O&M are most likely going to be centered around our generation portfolio as we restructure that generation portfolio. And let me just give you one example in particular, bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in the UP. Well, once we have that new generation online, and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle, it's about $40 million a year, which very, very significant both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity. So, I do believe, there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, not unimportant but more modest opportunities and say, we implement our new ERP system, so now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems. So, as we implement our new ERP system in this year and in 2018, I would see more savings opportunities there, but that's a little more modest. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And one follow-up just on the Bluewater Gas acquisition, the gas storage acquisition. Can you all remind us where are your gas utilities currently buying storage from? And how should we think about what the impact of this, if you assume like a utility like return, what the impact of this is for the customer? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So right now, the largest single, say, third-party provider of storage is ANR. So, ANR is the largest single provider. I believe that they provide about 40% of the storage or thereabouts for the operating companies, so that's the biggest one Michael. As the service agreements would be put in place, if you look at it from a present value standpoint, okay, so cover all the return of capital, cover all those costs, we would see roughly a $213 million net present value savings to customers. And in terms of the year where you would see an absolute reduction due to this, I think that's in year four, so pretty quickly gets to annual reduction in rates, and any increase in the early years, it's less than 1%, but present value, that's $200 million-plus \u2013 $213 million net present value, so very significant savings that we would see. Does that help Michael? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That helps a lot. And one last one, I apologize for the short list here. First quarter guidance and I know weather has not been so wonderful January to date, but first quarter guidance seems a little tepid. Can you talk a little bit about, given you're much more gassy now than you were pre-Integrys, what that means in terms of your kind of where you think you'll fall within 2017's range, if it has any impact at all and maybe how you're thinking about how kind of \u2013 and I know you've touched on this a little bit, but kind of how you're thinking about the broader growth of the company over time, multi-years out? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. And Scott, why don't you address Michael's question about the first quarter? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So the first quarter, you're correct Michael, the month of January right now is about 12% warmer than normal. It's like the seventh warmest in the last 57 years, so it's a pretty warm January. So, we did have an entry last year that took that $1.9 down to about $1.05. So if you take some weather of $0.01 or $0.02, we're kind of in the middle of the range that we provided. But it's really early in the year to say how that's going to affect our overall guidance, like Allen mentioned, we have a lot of O&M that we look at and monitor and we manage the business to get to our log (54:12) returns. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. And then I think Michael, in terms of longer-term growth, I addressed that in the script and also talked a little bit about it in the response to Greg Gordon's question, was there any other aspect specifically about that that you want me to cover? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, just kind of thinking about whether you see your electric business or your gas business, which of those two being a higher growth business and is the spread between the two significant? Are we talking about pennies or nickels, not dimes and quarters? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Well, in terms of \u2013 and let me talk about that in terms of capital allocation, if you will. So if you look at the five-year capital budget, just that half, in fact, maybe a little over half of the capital that we would expect to commit over the next five years is in the natural gas distribution business. So, given that the natural gas distribution as measured by rate base is about a quarter of the company, right now. In terms of percentage growth, we're going to see much greater or expect to see much greater percentage growth in earnings in the natural gas business than we would in electric. But in terms of absolute capital employed, it's almost even, electric versus gas. But in terms of percentage growth, most of it's going to come from gas we would expect. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Allen. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, how are you? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you, guys. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Take care, Jim. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yep. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Well, that concludes our conference call.

Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2017 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw this morning, we recorded first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better than forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities help to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Due to the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018, as well as 2019. This will make for a total of four years that base rates will be flat. This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019, and require us to continue to manage our cost aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for two years. Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on the equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers. We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers including three of our largest customers have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supportive. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The Commission formerly began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 28. Now, settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin, but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously. I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the Commission to consider and decide on June 1. Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment as well as this risk profile are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring a very meaningful benefits to our customers. In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. No substantive issues or concerns have been raised, and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project, if approved by the Michigan Commission. As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case. Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record in the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision. And I expect an order in the fourth quarter. Finally on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder to being a member of MISO, thus increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring its return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan. We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns. Now, just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents the compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. Now, with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer than normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather. The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed costs with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results. I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures. In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser expense continued investment in the gas system modernization program. The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to the decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our other states segment improved $1.6 million due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plans since the first quarter of 2016. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased $900,000. Taken the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in the operating income. During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys 6.11% Junior Subordinated Notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share. Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter, this was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates. Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31st, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017. Looking at the cash flow statement on page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increased compared to the first quarter of 2016, as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase to the dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016. Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago. Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are showing on the earnings package on page 8, weather normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us. Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share. With that, I'll turn things back to Allen. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. So we'll now begin the question-and-answer period. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : A couple of questions. So, the quantum of O&M reduction you saw on the quarter, was that a function of rationing down O&M in the quarter relative to understanding where your margin was coming in? When we look at Q2 versus Q2 O&M or balance of year O&M versus balance of year O&M, how should we think about those numbers going forward? I mean, clearly it would be a huge assumption to use the current base of O&M as a run rate. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, Greg, I think as we look at our plan for 2017, our plan was to bring O&M down 3% in 2017 relative to the actual run rate in 2016, and that's still our plan. But given how extraordinarily warm it was in January and February, we use, what I've talked about before, our flex down process to basically flex down spending to preserve our margins in the phase of the very, very warm weather. So, I think 3% down year-over-year on O&M is still a good assumption sort of on a whether normalized basis, so to speak, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So if your Q2 through Q4 numbers were to come in and theoretically on the plan, the O&M numbers quarter-over-quarter over for the balance of the year would be in that direction and magnitude? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, yes, the 3%. That's right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Got you. Moving down to the WE Power line, you saw $4.1 million improvement in operating income from higher capital investment. How should we think about how those numbers are going to trend over the balance of the year? Is that going to be at a sort of a $16 million improved operating income run rate because of higher capital, or was that for some reason lumpy in the quarter? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It was a little lumpy as we put those projects in, in the storage, the coal storage, and fuel blending. So, overall though, that should continue through the year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So not in the $4 million run rate, but there will be incremental earnings in each subsequent quarter that approach that increased amount? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, it will be an increased in each of the future quarters compared to the prior year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That, we just put it in service in January this year at the end of last year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Can you remind me what the total capital investment was, as you were in sort of a pretty consistent return on investment - Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, it was just under $60 million. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : $60 million. Okay. I have some other questions, I'll go to back in the queue. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, Allen and Scott, how are you? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : How are you? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. Good. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Is there an update on the Arizona co-op situation, and as well as Alaska? Is there any updates on wires opportunities there right now? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, Shar, those are just maybe a context for the others on the call, those were areas that American Transmission Company was targeting for development kind of outside their traditional footprint. In Arizona, they are working. They are looking at the feasibility of the number of transmission projects. My expectation is later this year. Can't really give you a specific date at this point, but they're actively looking at I think four different projects, and they would be prepared to propose some of those later this year in Arizona. And in Alaska, I don't have any update for you at this point in Alaska. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, got it. And then just on the Arizona, is that incremental to what you have as a placeholder, or would that be supportive of that? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It would be the latter, Shar. So we had $300 million of capital for what we called outside the footprint in the five-year plan. So whatever they propose there would be supportive of that $300 million. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Helpful. And then just lastly, I know obviously with your carbon reduction goals, you've talked about additional coal retirements. Can you sort of just, is there an update on how you're thinking about additional retirements and what the read-through could be for additional O&M savings as well as incremental gas needs? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, there's nothing at least in terms of additional requirements, other than the retirement of Presque Isle we talked about, which is about a 360-megawatt coal unit. We've also talked about the retirement of Pulliam, which is a coal unit in Green Bay in the WPS Service Territory. So, other than those two retirements, I don't have anything additional to announce. I would tell you though, Shar, if you look at kind of our carbon reduction goal and maybe describe it in terms of annual tons of reduction, so what we ultimately would like to see is about a $14 million annual run rate reduction in CO2, and based on the things that we've already announced, so the Pulliam and Presque Isle, and the things that we've done at our gas plants, you could get roughly $7 million out of that $14 million. So based on what we've already announced, you could get $7 million out of that $14 million, and those actions \u2013 not only would they reduce carbon, but they also would be a net savings to customers. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, excellent. I'll jump back in the queue. Congrats on the results. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was just wondering if you could talk about something you discussed last quarter. On the call in response to a question you talked about your capital plan supporting growth in the lower half or towards the lower end of the 5% to 7% range, and I was just wondering if you could remind us if there's a timeframe associated with this growth target, or if it's more indefinite? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So what we've said, and this is something that I've mentioned at least on a couple calls before this one, didn't go into as much detail on it on this call, but we look at a base of earnings in 2015 of $2.72 per share. And, Caroline, basically that $2.72, it effectively, it's like a pro forma number for the company as if we had never done the Integrys acquisition. Okay. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So we set that base of earnings at $2.72 in 2015, and what we've said as a long-term matter is sort of think of an envelope where the bottom end of the envelope is a 5% compound annual growth off $2.72, and then 7% is the upper end of the envelope. What we said, as a long-term matter, we expect our actual earnings, the trajectory, to be in that envelope. So that's really how we've laid out our goal. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So it's more of an indefinite kind of through 2020 and beyond type of timeframe than just through 2019? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, I would characterize it as long-term; I'm not sure anything is indefinite, but... Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: ...but it's certainly long term. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just kind of on another note, I was just wondering if you could comment on to what extent earnings sharing mechanisms impacted the Q1 result? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Scott, do you want to address that? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It did not affect the Q1 results at all. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You said did not? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We weren't into a \u2013 it did not. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hello, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Allen. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. So, when we think about the rest of the year for O&M, because you were down far more than 3% in the first quarter, should we assume a lower decline rate for the rest of the year, or simply that the remaining quarters you kind of stay near that 3% range, so you may actually kind of beat your expectations on O&M management just due to a really good start to the year? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, my expectation at this point, Michael, and of course, I can't sit here today and say whether it's going to be for the rest of the year, but if you had sort of a normal weather for the rest of the year, I still think for the year, we'd be down 3% on a O&M. We would stick pretty close to that plan, if we had normal weather. If, for some reason, it's warmer or cooler than normal, well, I expect we'd adjust. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Can I ask just a very basic question, when weather impacts O&M, what are the things that change, like when you're sitting around and it's February and we're not having winter, what is that that actually changes versus what you're thinking you are going to do on December 31st, heading into the year versus what you actually do? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, when you think about the weather, there's a couple of things, when you have consecutive warm weather like January was one of the warmest and February was the warmest, we're actually able to just reduce some O&M expenses because the actual number of leaks and coal outs where the frost the line is really \u2013 naturally reduces some O&M. And then, when we see that warm weather, everyone in the company like Allen talked about, we have our flex lists and we react to that and make sure that we can control our cost to offset the weather decline. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. CapEx in the quarter, so if I think about your full year guidance for CapEx of just over $2.1 billion and yet CapEx in the quarter was south of $350 million and you normally wouldn't do a ton on the electric side in the middle of the summer, should we assume this is very back-end loaded this year, or is there something where CapEx could be lower this year and bigger in future years? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, it's the first quarter, so we still have the winter season, so it's not the largest construction for us, unless we're finishing up our prior year project. So, the first quarter isn't the biggest construction, and remember, some of the construction we have and if the \u2013 we talk about including the storage field that we're looking at purchasing, that's in the back half of the year, so it's a little bit back-end loaded. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And then finally, I know you've got the settlement outstanding, and I just want to make sure I understand what is the Commission's process for reviewing and potentially approving the settlement, and what are the roles that the interveners who did not sign the settlement, what do they play in this process? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Well. Let me just maybe as background for everybody, settlements, Michael, are quite uncommon in commission history \u2013 in Wisconsin Commission history. So as a result, there is no prescribed settlement process in Wisconsin. And in some other states, you have some statutorily prescribed process for a settlement, you don't really have that here. So each settlement can be approached maybe in a somewhat different fashion. Sitting here today, I talked about the fact that the PSCW gave official notice of the proposed settlement on April 20. They indicated that they would soon set a date for a prehearing conference, and then if things work the way they usually work, Michael, they'd solicit comments after they do that prehearing conference. And then, they'll have to decide what process they want to use after that. But I would just reiterate, I mean there is very broad customer support for the settlement. So the 24 industrial customers that I talked about including the three largest customers that we have. Now, in terms of the role that other interveners would have, at this point, it's hard for me to say, and I mean I would assume they'd be like any other party in a contested proceeding. So, they wouldn't be any different than how they typically would be in a contested proceeding. That will be my expectation at least. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. I was just thinking through it because two of the large groups that are normally part of the process weren't signatory to your stipulation. So, just trying to think through how they factor in all of those. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Well, one of those, and I think you're referring to the two permanent intervener groups. One of those permanent intervener groups is what I think of was a trade association, many of whose members actually individually supported the settlement. And then you've got another permanent intervener group called CUB, which is not really a trade association, but I think their remit is to represent residential customers largely. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, got it. Thank you, Allen. Much appreciate the insight, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Any update on the legislation around Power the Future and where does that stand? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Well, I think where it stands, it was referred to an assembly committee, which of course is the lower house of the legislature, then it was also referred to a senate committee. At this point, there've been no hearings that have been scheduled at a committee level. So, that's where it stands, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. When does the legislative session end? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Paul, I believe they're in session until at least the end of May, and of course this is a budget year, so I'm not sure they can go home until they have a budget. But I think it's that the end of May, Paul, but we can get you a more precise answer offline. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is the budget discussion contentious? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm not sure, I would just call it any more or less contentious than Wisconsin budgets have been. Unlike other states, they consistently have a budget. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi, good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Dan. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Yes. My first question kind of relates to the energy sales shown on pages 8 and the bottom of page 7. It looks like the 2017 normalized versus 2016 normalized, you have a nice pickup in the small commercial industrial area... Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. That's correct. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : ...particularly in Wisconsin on and then on the gas side. So, I was wondering is that something that we should anticipate it's going to continue, or you could give us a little more color on what's going on there? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, the small class in our electric sales on a weather normalized basis, we calculate it to be up 1.4%. Now, like we talked about the quarter, it was extremely warm this quarter. So, normalization in this sector and all sectors is pretty tricky, especially when you're talking, with commercial, there is a variety of different commercial operations there. So, the class has always been a little stronger for us. And in our long-term forecast, we have about a 0.5% year here at for next year \u2013 for this coming year. So, it was a good quarter, but once again, it was only one quarter, I'd still look at overall being about 0.5%. And that's what I see in high class. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Then you also mentioned you had a $100 million pension contribution in the first quarter. I was wondering if you could just update us on sort of where you're kind of on pension funding, and should that like satisfy your needs for the next few years or how should we think about that payment? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. So yeah, we evaluate the pension, as you know, every year in March, intensely during the year, it gets us to be about fully funded about a 100% on a GAAP basis. So, we don't see any contributions in the near-term, but of course we'll continue to evaluate. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then, I just wonder if you could update us on the debt financing plans in terms of timing? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. So we have a couple debt financing plans this year. One, first, we're looking at putting debt versus intercompany debt down at our Minnesota and Michigan subs. So we're looking at that financing. So that is one item that we'll be doing. Another financing, and that'll probably each be around $100 million each. So those financings we'll be working on this year. We'll also be looking at \u2013 continue some debt at our gas utility, Peoples Gas, with the continued construction program. So that'll be happening this year also. Of course when we look, at with the purchase of Bluewater, there's potential financing with that also. And then we continue to monitor all the large electric utilities, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Public Service, potentially, one, we'll have to monitor that as we go through the year. Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Allen. So, just on the rate settlement filing, so you mentioned the commission is going to be setting a prehearing; they still have not set the date of that yet? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Steve, to my knowledge at this point, they have not set a date for the prehearing conference. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And how long can this process go before you need to kind of make your normal rate filing? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, my view right now, Steve, would be that I'm going to wait for the commission to take some definitive action, either a definitive action that they approve the settlement or a definitive action that they reject the settlement. I think financially, we're just fine waiting for that definitive answer. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So we'll wait. As I was saying in the prepared comments, I do think they'll act expeditiously, but there's just no prescribed process, so - Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just in terms of like \u2013 someone asked about other parties \u2013 just I assume you probably talk to other parties. Just do you expect some of them to oppose the settlement or you just got to wait and see what happens? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I think we really have to wait and see what happens. At this point, the interventions, they've raised their hand and intervened, but without even having had the prehearing conference, it's hard to know what their positions are at this point. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just any update you may have given us and I missed it just on the Illinois Gas Infrastructure Investment Program? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. And I did touch on it just briefly, but maybe just as kind of a review and summary. My expectation sitting here today is that we'll deploy about $300 million worth of capital over the course of the entire year on the S&P program. The Illinois Commission has asked for \u2013 going back to the workshop proceedings, remember that they had last year \u2013 they've asked for some additional information, I believe our deadline for filing is the middle part of May for that additional information, and additional briefs. And they've indicated that they would decide this year, so that's where we are with that process. But in the interim, we're continuing with the program, as we laid out in our three-year plan to them. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Leslie. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Hi, Allen. You said for the quarter that one of the things that had you come in above your guidance with better-than-expected fuel recoveries. Could you just walk through how that - Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Right, on the electric side. Scott, do you want to talk about and go through that? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. So, going into the quarter, we were anticipating that gas prices were a little bit higher. They actually were a little bit higher. And then with the continued \u2013 so we thought the recoveries would be a little bit less about $0.02 worth, and then as the warm weather continued, our natural gas prices went down and, in fact, our fuel recovery at both of the utilities came in slightly better than we anticipated, just because of the price of the electricity on the market and running our plants with the natural gas. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: So does that get trued up over the course of the year? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, you have a fuel band at both of the utilities, so that's the plus or minus 2%, so our outlook at this point, Leslie, would be that given normal weather, we would expect to be about fully recovered at each of the utilities, again for electric fuel. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: But not ahead of plan? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. At this point, I wouldn't project to be ahead of plan. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Okay. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Or ahead of fully recovered. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct. Right. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Right. Right. Right. And then just on the C&I side, frac sand, fracking is starting to pick up again if you've seen, you've done some gas infrastructure in Western Wisconsin in 2014, 2015. I'm just wondering if you're sort of seeing any uptick in activity in that regard? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. We're starting in the first quarter, when you look at first quarter 2017 versus 2016, we are seeing a slight uptick in that frac sanding sector. So, it's nice growth. Remember, frac sanding is, I think when you look at our sales of the gas side in Wisconsin excluding residential, it's between 1.5% and 2% of sales, so it's a nice grouping and we did see a nice little uptick there. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: So just more broadly then on C&I, on the electric side, your mines \u2013 the mining activity was down pretty heavily, was that the iron ore mines? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. That is correct. So, those are the iron ore mines that \u2013 that's what we look at with and without those. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Right, okay. And then just broadly speaking the rest of the C&I business on the electric side across your jurisdictions is roughly flat on a weather normal basis? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. The large C&I, that has been relatively flat just \u2013 once again the economy is \u2013 it's moving a little bit, but those sales have been very flat in the last several months, quarters. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Leslie. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: The iron ore mines, are these the mines that are going to eventually close and they're just kind of ramping down here, which mines are these? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, there are the two large mines in the UP of Michigan. So, these are the Cliffs Resources mines. So, Paul, and I always mix up the names, but one of the mines is roughly a third of the usage up there, and that's the one if you remembering is going down into shutdown. The other mine which is about two-thirds, which is the Tilden mine, that's the larger of the two and that's the one at least the Cliffs has indicated that they're going to run for the long term. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is it the impact we are seeing now is the one that's permanently closing? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct. Correct. I think that actually was closing last fall, previously, it was shut down \u2013 I think it's actually closed now. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And the Tilden never scaled back operations and they're going to ramp and back up another sales recovery and what's the dynamic there? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I think and I didn't listen to their call, their earnings call, but my understanding at least is, if they see an uptick in demand, could they sell to steel mills obviously, if they see an uptick there, they would be poised to increase production, but otherwise, I think they're going to be pretty flat, would be my expectation.

Analysts: Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Second Quarter 2017 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warmer than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Now, I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin Natural Gas Distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of these three companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. You may recall on April 4, we filed a proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Now under the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of four years that base rates will be flat, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services' allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% would go back to benefit customers. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses, and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support of a board cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supportive. The Commission began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate-freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency, and thus in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us. Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the Commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September timeframe. Should the Commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case. In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment. Turning to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year. Now, a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity with state's per capita real GDP is growing faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999 and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 second quarter earnings increased to $0.63 per share from $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Effective cost controls continued to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower than expected cost at our Illinois utilities and longer than normal June weather contributed to these results. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter beginning with operating income by segment, and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 7 of our earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million from the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the Gas System Modernization Program. Operating income in our Other segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures. Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the Non-Utility Energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the Non-Utility Energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment in our Power the Future plan since the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $30.1 million increase in operating income. During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews. Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest. Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year due largely to the settlement of several items. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017. Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater. However, this investment is identified as a separate line on the cash flow statement. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinate Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $328.3 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016. Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 11 and page 12 of the earnings package respectively. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectation and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecast. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition cost to arrive at adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings that quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking these into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. With that, I'll turn things back to Allen. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session portion of our conference call. Operator : All right, thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hello, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : How are you? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I just want to understand sort of procedurally what the potential scenarios are at the Commission with regard to the Staffs' suggestions, right? So, they basically said, A, approve the deal as filed, which is clearly your preference. Another one is, reject it and have them file the rate case, which is pretty obvious. But the third path is not so clear to me. If the Commission were to say, we accept the settlement, but imposed the conditions that the Staff had opined be implemented, at that point, could you say, we'd rather file a rate case? Or would you be then compelled to accept that decision? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, we'd not be compelled to accept the decision, so maybe just to state for everybody on the call to make sure they understand your question. So basically, you have a scenario, Greg, where the Commission says well, all right, we accept the settlement subject to the addition of some or all of the conditions that the Commission staff propose, so that's the hypothetical scenario. Well, in that scenario, given the way the settlement was structured, it's not severable. So if it's not accepted in whole, well, the settlement basically falls away unless we and the other parties who came up with the settlement, unless we all agree to a different set of conditions. So, we wouldn't be compelled, Greg, in the scenario you lay out to accept that modified settlement, if you will. And as I described in the opening remarks, the next step would be, we'd file a general rate case. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to hear you state that so that it was clear because looking at the conditions, they were clearly put \u2013 they seem to, at least some of them, put a lot more pressure on unit control costs by virtue of not allowing you under certain of those conditions to continue to defer costs and by reducing the amount you could earn on significant regulatory asset balances, right? So, it would seem to me that unless you had \u2013 were able to pull off some herculean effort vis-\u00e0-vis cost cutting, there would be the potential for some significant regulatory lag under that scenario. Is that fair? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. I agree with that description. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. That was my only question. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Liou with JPMorgan. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Larry. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just touch quickly on how you plan to address the ratings pressure at Moody's? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'll let Scott talk about \u2013 and I think Larry's question is about the recent action that Moody's took and whether we have any actions that we would plan in response to that. Is that fair, Larry? Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Exactly. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So, just to remind everyone, Moody's at our Wisconsin utilities moved them down one notch from A1 to A2 and they described several reasons and one of them is the recovery of some of the regulatory items and not having riders compared to other jurisdictions. With that, now they've put our holding company on a negative watch or outlook also. We're continuing to monitor our holding company debt to total debt, and that's one of the items I think they'd like to see that come back a little faster than we've reduced it. However, as we continue to find good investments such as the Bluewater investment, that will add some stress to the holding company, but it's good for the customers and good for the shareholders as it continues to improve earnings. So we're monitoring that holding company debt and as you can tell, watching our financials as tight as possible. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess just on Bluewater, can you just remind us how you financed the acquisition again? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. So, the way it'll be financed, Larry, initially of course, we'd just take down commercial paper at the holding company to fund the $230 million acquisition price. $115 million or roughly half of the investment down at the sub will be equity and then another $115 million will be non-recourse debt, meaning non-recourse to the holding company debt down at the Bluewater Holding level. And then so we'll take $115 million from that financing and pay down some holding company debt. But the holding company is essentially funding its equity contribution, if you will, into the subsidiary with debt up at the holding company. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hello, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, everyone. Hey, Allen and Scott. How are you? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Just one question, with the Bluewater acquisition, you're kind of sort of chipping away at some incremental growth opportunities that can help you maybe get you above the bottom end of your range. Is there sort of any updates on additional growth opportunities you're kind of working on, maybe the Arizona opportunities or additional storage assets, anything that could help get you above? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question. And I guess we \u2013 in the November, actually early November timeframe, probably around the EEI Finance Conference, we'd provide a complete update on our five-year capital plan. So, I don't have any incremental update today. But what I would say is I'm feeling very optimistic about additional opportunities. Some of those kind of in the areas that you were alluding to in your question, in the midstream natural gas assets where we would purchase assets that we could either financially or physically integrate with our natural gas distribution company. So, feel optimistic, but what I'd rather do is really provide a complete update and a five-year plan in early November. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : That's super-helpful. Just for \u2013 I think we've talked about sensitivity purposes. Roughly what is it, the capital program, around $1.5 billion over a five-year period could equate to about 1% incremental growth? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. Yes. Just to be clear. So, if you look over a five-year plan and you invest $1.6 billion of capital and let's assume that that's levered 50/50, so, 50% equity, 50% debt and then you earn approximately a 10% return on the equity piece. You're exactly right, that would add 1 percentage point to the five-year compound annual growth in EPS. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Terrific. Good results, guys. Thanks. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hello, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon. How are you? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just did you book any FERC ROE complaint, reserves, or refunds in this quarter? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, it was \u2013 the entry we talked about in the prepared comments was in 2016. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And did you quantify that? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So, this \u2013 I don't know the exact dollar amount. It had to be around $8 million, I'm assuming, $8 million to $9 million. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Pre-tax? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Pre-tax. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hello, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey, how are you doing? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm good. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm managing. I just wanted to sort of follow up on Paul Ridzon's question there. The ROE, just if you could break it down for me. It seems like the FERC transmission impact seems a lot more this quarter than last quarter. If you could just walk me through why it's so much more? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. I mean, it's a good question. Last year in the second quarter, the ALJ came out with their decision to, for their second case, to have the FERC ROE was at \u2013 for the second case at 10.2%. Now remember that's 9.7% plus a 50 basis point adder to 10.2%. And that time, then we looked at the complaint period and took an entry in that quarter to record that reserve to that 10.2%. Since then, in September of last year, the FERC came out with their decision in the first case that was at a 10.82% ROE, which is a 10.32%, plus a 50 basis point adder to the 10.82%. And since the end of September, we've been booking at that 10.82% until we'll hear on that second complaint. And the second complaint, we're waiting for a quorum now at FERC. We don't know what they'll be in the second half of the year, but currently, we're booking at the 10.82%. So, the main driver, the swing between quarters there was the entry last year to get down to the first reserve needed. And it may be a little bit higher too because we're booking at a 10.82%. But long-term in our financial plan, we talk about a 10.2% long-term outlook for the FERC ROE. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, in terms of the lower O&M. I was just wondering if you could break it out a little bit more in Illinois. I apologize if I just missed this, but between that and the continued SMP, and just where the other O&M savings are showing up? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Well, I think \u2013 let me let Scott maybe give you some color on Illinois, Paul. But maybe just to kind of reground everybody on our O&M plan for the year. So, the goal at an enterprise level was to reduce O&M 3% in 2017 as compared to the actual run rate of O&M \u2013 controlled O&M in 2016. And as I look at the Wisconsin utilities for the year, we've got some timing of O&M expenditures that were moved around because we had to respond to the warmer than normal weather in the first quarter. There's also going to be some downstream O&M effects of the storms that we had that affected the electric business in Wisconsin in the second quarter. But overall, my expectation is that those Wisconsin utilities will be right on top of that 3%. But in Illinois, we're actually doing better than plan on O&M. So, Scott, do you want to give Paul some additional color on that? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. So, Illinois, the drivers \u2013 it's a combination of, like you said, the O&M and the rider. I would say probably about $8 million to $10 million of that variance year-to-date is related to the QIP rider, the capital investment, plus some other riders that are just a pass-through of O&M. But O&M is the major driver in there. And that's the majority of the remaining of it, I'd say $10 million to $15 million, plus some other lower interest expenses. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And then just back to the settlement, it seems that when you read the staff, it seems to be saying sort of two different things. On the one hand, it seems to be saying what you just mentioned, which was that they would calculate \u2013 they think it's likely that there'll be a revenue deficiency. But I guess they also start talking about the ROE and how that could maybe change a few things if that was changed. And then they also discussed the concern that they apparently have about rate increases in the future because of the deferrals. And based on what I'm hearing from what you're saying, it looks like \u2013 unless the Commission is okay with these deferrals growing that you probably have to go in for a rate case. Is that right? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, let's just make sure that we're clear on the financial effect that our proposal would have. Our proposal if it were the settlement \u2013 okay, just to be \u2013 so the settlement that we entered into with our customers, if that were implemented, if you look at the projected balances, if you look at where we expect to be at the end of 2017 and look at where we would expect those balances to be at the end of 2019 if they adopted the settlement. I mean if you look end to end, Paul, we would expect there to be no growth on a net basis in those deferred balances. So we'd sort of de-level 2019 year-end versus 2017 year-end, so we wouldn't have any additional accumulation of balances and the hope that we have is that with tax reform that then you will start having some uplift, if you will, or a cost reduction effectively that you could use to start managing those balances down. But if you look at during the pendency of the rate freeze period that we proposed in the settlement, there wouldn't be any net growth at all in those balances. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So, when the Commission Staff says that their analysis suggests that the approach that you guys are proposing could result in a new deferred balance, if you were to put that new deferred balance with respect to the legacy deferred balances, for lack of a better term, you'd still basically be net no change in the deferred balance at 2019, is that correct? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right, out to 2019, that's correct. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I mean, we do have some deferred balances that relates to deferred taxes. But once again, we won't collect that from the customers. We'll collect that when we pay it back to the government which will be approximately a 50-year period on these taxes. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And is that what the Commission's referring to with respect to the staff referring to when they talk about the results of a new deferred \u2013 any new deferred balance? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I think that's what they're referring to is the tax deferred balance. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Dan. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi, good afternoon. So, first I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the earlier discussion around the Moody's downgrade. Just wondering, so do you have, say, a ratings target or a leverage target for your balance sheet at both the pairing in at the utilities at a point where you manage towards or the \u2013 a lot level you would defend the rating? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. When we look at our utilities, we want to keep all the utilities in that single-A rated category. So, they moved a little bit within the category with Moody's now and we did try to defend it to keep it up to that level because we know the cheaper interest is always good for our customers. So, we want to keep in that single-A rated category. At the holding company, right now it's on a negative watch. It potentially could move down a little bit and we're going to continue to monitor that. If it does move down a notch, I mean that's where we'll really continue to look at our holding company debt and manage that. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes, I think one of the focuses, Dan, that we've had for quite a while is managing the percentage that holding company debt represents as a proportion of consolidated debt. And so, we've certainly taken a number of actions this year to keep that within the balance that we like it to be. We did permanent non-recourse financings at Michigan Gas Utilities as well as MERC over in Minnesota at the gas utility there. And I mentioned the financing that we would plan later this year at Bluewater. So I think all of those has been and will be helpful, and also managing that holding company debt to consolidated debt percentage within a reasonable range. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Then I also was wondering on page 7 where you show the comparisons from this year to last year. You also had a $4.6 million difference in the corporate and other category. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what was driving that change. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. There's a lot of little variety of items in that segment there. Just one item and this is kind of inside baseball. But we had some investments that were at the service company that really belong more at the utilities. So, we put the investments in the utilities versus the service company. Their earnings stayed the same, their capital stayed the same, it's just once again, it took \u2013 just moved it into the utility where it belongs. Some of those were still there last year at the acquisition. It's just kind of the cleanup of what we think is the best way to run the service company. So, just a variety of little items. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then the last question I had is, there's been some speculation and later today, there'll be an announcement of a large Foxconn facility in Southeastern Wisconsin. And I don't want you to spill the beans or steal the thunder there, but there's been talk about a site where there was an old Chrysler engine plant or whatever. I just wondered if you could confirm whether that site is in your service territory. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. The site that I believe you're referencing is in our service territory, unless they are (36:50) service territory that the electric service territory for Wisconsin Electric. And I'm sure, Dan, we've both read some of the same reports in the press. Certainly Governor Walker has been in detailed discussions with the senior people at Foxconn. Foxconn has indicated that they'll be making a decision soon. But at this point, they haven't made a formal announcement. But what I would say, Dan, the investment that's being discussed would be quite significant for the economy here in Wisconsin. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Zuho (37:48) with Avon Capital Advisors. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Joe (37:50). Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Hey, it's actually Andrew Levi. How are you doing? Or Andy Levi. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm good, Andy, how are you? An unexpected pleasure. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Yes, I did. Okay, real quick, because I know everybody wants to get off the call. I'm probably the last question. So, just to understand, you were very clear on the settlement, it's all or nothing. But I had this one question on that. Have you spoken to the people or the other organizations that are in the settlement with you? Are they on the same page there or is there a little bit of wiggle room between you and the settlement parties and the Commission? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We have had, Andy. From time to time, we've had discussions, sort of updates, if you will, with the other parties to the settlement. And they really have the same view that I have. This is a settlement that \u2013 it was highly negotiated between the folks in the settlement and it's not severable. I mean, they view it as a package and we view it as a package, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. So, it really is all or nothing? Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, we have a package that we and our customers think they're in the best interest of all the customers. So, I mean, I think it's \u2013 as constructed, it's a very, very good package. So, I would be hopeful that the Commissioners would agree with my assessment of it. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. That's it. Thanks. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: You're welcome. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, that concludes our conference call today. Thank you for participating. If you have more questions, please contact Beth Straka. Her number here in Milwaukee is area code 414-221-4639. Thank you.",

Analysts: Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Third Quarter 2017 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Mr. Klappa, the floor is yours. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sarah, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now, before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month. I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery. I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is obviously to bring Allen back. But again, your kindness and concern have meant a great deal to Allen and his family and a great deal to all of us as well. My thanks. Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. We'll begin with our third quarter results. As I am sure you saw from our new release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share. We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls. Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter. Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally one of the two warmest months in the Midwest. Next, I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investments. On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8. Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for four years and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. Now, just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return. Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers. Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs. Turning to Michigan. I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project. Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines. They will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland Cliffs. And now, for an update on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Since we acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics. We've lowered contractor construction cost by 15%. We've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints. Construction timelines have been reduced by more than 25% and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with the City of Chicago is greatly improved. Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain. As you may recall, we still have an open docket (5:54) on the preferred approach to this long-term project. We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year-end. And consistent with our 2017 plan, we're on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year. Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. We've also requested under the procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8%, effective January 1 of 2018. A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. I'd also like to update you on a recent FERC decision related to the System Support Resource payments for the Presque Isle power plant in Michigan. In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February of 2014 through January of 2015. As you may recall, this is very close to the amount that the administrative law judge recommended last year. So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in net income and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year-end guidance. Next, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new five-year capital forecast at the EEI Finance Conference in early November. Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me in my role as Chairman of the board. In the past few weeks, I've of course reviewed the capital plan in great detail and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan. Now, one piece of that new five-year plan has just been put in place. Our Wisconsin Public Service Utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric have purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. Forward consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts. The wind farm is located 10 miles south of Fond du Lac in the eastern part of the state. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings, because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement. Pending regulatory approvals, closing on the Forward Wind Center could take place next spring. Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new five-year capital plan at EEI and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. And speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer, the announcement that Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history. Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world. And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8K to the United States. The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Racine County just south of Milwaukee. We expect the electric demand from this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts, that's approximately three times the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer. And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility. Foxconn has chosen a site in southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network. We will not need to build any new generation. Our state-of-the-art network is well-equipped today to provide reliable, low-cost energy to Foxconn. Now, on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears, and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you. The German candymaker, Haribo, has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America. So, as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well. And now, with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our esteemed Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the third quarter of 2016. Our results were primarily driven by a return to normal weather conditions, offset by positive impact of cost control. Weather in 2016 was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results, both GAAP and adjusted. There were no adjustments made to GAAP earnings in 2017. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 9 of the earning packet, our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2017 was $393.6 million compared to the adjusted $402.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income decreased $19.4 million quarter-over-quarter. Lower margin was driven by a return to normal weather and a normal fuel recovery pattern. This was offset by operations and maintenance expense that was $39.9 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2016. Last year, we recorded $18.6 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the earnings-sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In the third quarter of 2017, Our Illinois segment recognized an operating income increase of $800,000 compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system modernization program. As expected, operating loss in our Other States segment increased $2.1 million, driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense, resulting from an increase in capital investments in our gas distribution utilities. Turning now to our Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure segment. As a reminder, this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30 of this year, as well as the results of the Power the Future plans. For the third quarter, operating income in this segment was up $9.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.9 million to operating income in 2017. Operating income from our Power the Future plans increased $3.8 million, reflecting the additional investment at these plans since the third quarter of 2016. Operating income at our Corporate and Other segment was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.1 million from the adjusted operating loss in the third quarter of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $8.9 million decrease in adjusted operating income. During the third quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.2 million, an increase of $900,000 compared to the same quarter of 2016. Other income net increased by $8.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to two items; higher investment gains related to our deferred compensation plan and we incurred losses in our third quarter of 2016 related to the disposition of some non-utility assets. Interest expense increased $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in debt levels resulting from continued capital investments. Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect that our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. Combining all these items brings us to earnings of $215.4 million or $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016. For the year-to-date, adjusted earnings increased $0.07 to $2.43 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted $2.36 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was largely due to cost control and efficiency gains. Looking at the cash flow statement at page 7 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. A reduction in working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017. Our capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2017, a $309.1 million increase compared to the same period in 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. Our debt to capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of 2016. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity, we are using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $492.4 million in common stock dividends during the first nine months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million over the same period last year. Moving to sales, we see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 13 and 14 of the earnings package, on a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, normalized sales results for natural gas were slightly above our expectations and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations. Turning now to our earnings forecasts, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Scott, thank you very much. We're on track and, as always, focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, I believe we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : All right. Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Afternoon, guys. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Shar, how are you? Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good, how are you? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're doing well. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Just really one question for today, with Presque Isle, you're roughly 7 million tons short of what your internal target is. Is there any sort of updates that you can provide on sort of additional coal retirements, and maybe looking at some of the assets like North Oak (18:49) or Pleasant Prairie and sort of how are you thinking about that? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I can tell you that we have a generation restructuring plan under review, and we'll be able to provide you with a lot more detail when we roll out our five-year capital forecast at EEI. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. I'll wait \u2013 we'll wait till EEI. Scott, definitely give our best wishes again to Allen for a speedy recovery. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Julien. How are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good. Good. Again, I want to echo Shar's comments. Please do send our best to Allen, or Allen, if you're listening, all the best. Wanted to touch base quickly on the O&M reductions, clearly the team's done an incredible job year-to-date. Can you comment a little bit on the drivers of this and thoughts into the years ahead on the cadence of the reduction? And then, perhaps, in tandem with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on recovery, from a regulatory perspective, of the latest investment you all are talking about on the wind side, just given the stayout (20:00), et cetera? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Sure. Well, I'll frame the answer for you and will let Scott provide some additional detail. But in terms of the \u2013 and the team has done a great job on O&M reduction, much of the O&M reduction that we're seeing here is from efficiency gains, not just one-time cost controls. And a lot of what we're seeing is really enabled by the fact that at the end of June of 2015 we acquired Integrys and we're ahead of plan clearly in terms of cost savings resulting from the acquisition. Most all of the cost savings that we've seen so far through the first nine months of this year, Scott, are really from our Wisconsin operations. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It's actually been Wisconsin was mainly in this third quarter, but across all the enterprise; Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota and Michigan, all the utilities contributed. Each one of our operations managers and vice presidents have plans in place to continue to take costs out of the business. So, we continue to see even next year taking additional cost out in future years. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And we're seeing \u2013 Scott is exactly right. I think you're going to continue to see efficiency gains and cost reductions going forward. A lot of it, I think, is going to come from the generation side of our business and we'll talk a lot more about that as we roll out the new five-year capital plan. But we see continuing good opportunity, really strong opportunity for ongoing cost reduction, Julien. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And then the second part of the question was talking about our new investment in the wind farm and those \u2013 that Forward Wind investment, we already have those costs are included in rates. So, it's already part of a purchase power agreement and we're just converting it to an asset-earning investment versus a purchase power agreement. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So rather than an O&M expense that flows through fuel, basically, we've converted that or will convert that upon closing, as Scott said, to an earning assets that will actually reduce cost for customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. So, technically, that couples back into the first question here around the cadence of costs, you've delineated yet another point into next year. In fact, actually, if I could kind of press you a little bit further, are there opportunities like this one to convert fuel expense into earning assets? This seems pretty novel. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, why don't we just say this, stay tuned, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : There we go. Excellent. Well, all the best. I hope to see you all soon. And again, Allen, all the \u2013 best of luck with the recovery. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Afternoon, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Afternoon, Gale. I wish I could say, I'm hearing your voice under different circumstances. Always enjoy hearing your voice. Please pass along my thoughts to Allen and the family. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I have a question. It's interesting. Wisconsin has made a lot of progress in terms of the utilities across the state, meeting the Renewable Portfolio Standards. And yet, if you did a screen of states that are still very coal-heavy, Wisconsin would show up in the top tier of U.S. states. How do you think this changes for the state as a whole and for your utilities in the state over the next five to seven years? And what do you think the types of resources are that drive that to change? And how does this fit given what \u2013 given the utilities are largely already in compliance with the Renewable Portfolio Standard? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, it's a good question, Michael. Let me try to give you two or three thoughts on that. First of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels. We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the cost of some renewables. Believe it or not, I mean when you when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of the utility scale solar, I mean, even three or four years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh gosh, $4,000 a megawatt installed \u2013 cost of $4,000 a megawatt installed for a large utility scale solar plant in Wisconsin. That's today down to circa $1,300. So, what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios, not just in our state, but elsewhere, particularly where they're coal heavy, is really economics. And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet. In part we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates, because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we've already built and are in place. So, I think we're very well-positioned to continue to take costs out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions. But at the end of the day, I mean the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal \u2013 clearly, less of coal. But at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, will look like a third, a third, a third. Basically, a third coal or a third fossil fuel, a third renewables, third natural gas. Does that help at all, Michael? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That helps a lot. Thank you for that. I know that's a little bit of a longer-term question, so I appreciate answering that as well as you possibly can, given what's in the public domain. I have one for, Scott, and this is a question of \u2013 I mean, I think if I were to take a poll of investors, most people think coming at EEI either this year or next year or some future year, your capital budgets will move higher, there is more renewable investment coming, there is more other investment coming. I guess the question really, I'd ask you, Scott, is how much balance sheet capacity do you think the company has, whether it's for incremental rate base growth or you've shown the ability to successfully integrate another company, whether it'd be incremental M&A? How are you thinking about the strength of the balance sheet and how much room or excess capacity the current balance sheet has? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good question, Michael. And when we look at it, we're looking at it in a couple of metrics, we look at our holding company debt as a percent of total debt, keeping it under 30%, but remember that's funding the equity, that's making good utility return investments. So we're looking at that. And we look at our FFO to debt at that 16 to 19 range, and looking at our plans and the plan we talk about at EEI, we'll roll it out, we're going to be comfortable in those ranges with no additional shares being issued. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you. Much appreciated, guys. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Take care, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi. Good afternoon. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Dan, you're back? Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Yeah. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: About that life coach stuff I was offering you, now that I'm sitting in for Allen, be happy to try to guide you, because I know you probably got a little off-track in the last year or so. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Yeah, I've just been kind of lost in the woods. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Exactly. So, any help I can give you, just let me know. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. I appreciate that. And I would also like to echo the best wishes to Allen in his recovery. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Dan. We'll certainly pass your goodwill along. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. I had a question kind of around the current tax reform proposals and debate in terms of, have you thought at all about \u2013 I know you have amount of (28:28) maturities in \u2013 I think $550 million in June in next year, along with $800 million or so of short-term debt. Have you thought at all about there's been some proposals to eliminate interest deduction, but grandfathering in current debt. Has there been any thought of doing any pre-funding of any of those maturities or short-term debt to try to lock in the deductibility of those interest expenses? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Dan, we thought, first of all, you might buy up all the non-deductible stuff. No, that's not true. Let me say this, that the whole picture related to interest deductibility, bonus depreciation, the whole picture is pretty murky right now. I mean, we've obviously had some very good discussions with the tax writing people in the House. Of course, Paul Ryan is very involved in the crafting of the legislation. But it is just way too early to think about a pre-funding or think about any change in our plan. We're going to have to see, first of all, whether tax reform actually gets completed and then what the real details are. And there's some thought that there might be an optional election on interest deductibility with a trade-off on another tax deduction item. We just have to see. At this point, I think anything that \u2013 I mean we're obviously looking at the landscape, but anything that I might tell you would be pure speculation until we really understand the details, I understand the House passed a budget today which raises the percentage possibility that tax reform will actually take place. But we're just going to have to see the details and then we'll figure out where to go. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. And then I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on, particularly the industrial demand picture. I noticed that was down again and that should be less impacted by weather than the other classes. Other than the Foxconn and the mines, what you're seeing from your other industrial customer demand? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We'll be happy to do that. And I'll ask Scott to chime in as well. Let me just say this \u2013 and you've heard me say this before. On a very short-term basis, I'm quite skeptical of our ability to weather normalize accurately. And you are correct, industrial demand should be less weather sensitive than any other group of customers, but there's still some weather sensitivity. So, I think we need to look over a much longer period of time than just one quarter versus a comparison to another quarter where it was 43% warmer than normal. So, I wouldn't be overly-concerned, one way or another, about one quarter's results. But we are seeing some, what Scott calls, green shoots in three or four specific industry sectors and we'll let Scott tell you about those. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So \u2013 exactly, Gale. So, as we mentioned before, we track this information on a daily and quarterly basis, looking at this. And we're starting to see a couple areas of some growth. We have basically four sectors; the food and food products sector, the paper products area, actually rubber and plastics, and another sector that just kind of showed up this quarter is fabricating metal. So encouraged by what we're starting to see in these individual sectors and hopefully that growth continues as we move forward here. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And for what it's worth, and Scott and I have talked about this, the Foxconn demand growth \u2013 the demand growth we'll see from Foxconn and demand growth we'll see from Haribo and several of the other really good economic development projects that have come to fruition, we haven't yet put those in our numbers. So, for example, Foxconn, I wouldn't think, would affect our industrial sales until probably 2020. And then, they'll ramp up, obviously, from the start. But our projections today really do not include any of those recent developments. Correct, Scott? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. That is correct. We're still just being very conservative to make sure that we have the appropriate efficiency gains to be able to do our capital investments, but there's potential upside here. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And it wouldn't surprise you that Scott and Allen are being very conservative. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome, Dan. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. That concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate you participating. If you have any additional questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka. Her direct line, 414-221-4639. Again, thank you very much, everyone. Take care.",

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Mr. Klappa, the floor is yours. Gale Klappa : Leverett Allen is in good physical condition and he continues to make progress in his recovery and rehabilitation work. Among other activities, Allen is engaged in extensive speech therapy at a leading stroke rehabilitation center. No specific time table has been established for his return to the Company, so as we announced a few months ago, I've agreed to serve as Chief Executive for as long as necessary. And on behalf of Allen and his family, I want to thank you again for your well wishes and all your support. Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations; and the newest member of our senior team, Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. As many of you know, Peggy is stepping into the shoes of Susan Martin. Susan served the Company with real distinction for the past 18 years and should be retiring at the end of the first quarter, and we certainly wish her well. Peggy joined us last year from Modine Manufacturing where she was General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Her deep business background, her experience as a General Counsel at a public company, make her a perfect fit for our team, so Peggy welcome aboard. Peggy Kelsey : Thank you. Gale Klappa : You are welcome. Now, I'll just start from our news release this morning. We reported full year 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.14 a share. The colder than normal temperatures particularly between Christmas and New Year added $0.02 a share and drove us above the top end of our guidance range. I'll also point out that our reported earnings of $3.14 a share exclude a one-time non-cash gain of $0.65 a share from the tax reform law that was signed in December. This one-time, non-cash gain reflects the application of the new tax law for the Company's non-utility assets and to the assets of the parent company. We'll touch on the full impact of the tax reform in more detail in just a few minutes. Now, as we review the year just passed, I am pleased to report that our company performed at a high level on virtually every meaningful measure from network reliability to customer satisfaction to community involvement. We delivered record financial results. Our largest utility WE Energies was named the most reliable utility in America and the best in the Midwest for the seventh year running. We made significant progress upgrading the natural gas infrastructure in Chicago. And after reviewing our environmental, social and governance practices, Corporate Responsibility Magazine named us one of the 50 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States. In addition, our track record of reliability and competitive rates was a factor in the decision by Foxconn Technology Group to invest $10 billion in a high tech manufacturing campus here in Wisconsin. This is one of the largest economic development projects in American history. We expect Foxconn to employ 13,000 people, as they create a brand new industry here in the United States and right here in Southeastern Wisconsin. So, all in all it was a year of solid performance for our company. Next, I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investment plan going forward. You'll recall that on August 10th, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8th. Under the approved settlement base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for four consecutive years and essentially gives us our customers' price certainty through 2019. The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place were extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism is in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. And just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return then anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely the customers. As part of the agreement, we\u2019ve also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs. Now, the commission order that approve the settlement contemplated the potential impact of tax reform. The order suggested that the benefits from a lower tax rate, we use to reduce a regulatory asset balances particularly those for uncollected transmission cost. We expect to file a formal plan with several options for the Wisconsin commission to consider in early February. And now an update on Illinois, we continue to make real progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization plan. And on January 10th, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a final order that supports continuing the program at the same scope, pace and investment level that we proposed. As a reminder, this program is literally critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network as modern, safe and reliable. For many years to come, we will need to replace outdated natural gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago and is rusting with state-of-the-art materials. In addition, we\u2019re working with the Illinois commission on a plan to flow savings from the new federal tax law back to customers in Chicago. Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13th, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to raise natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. On November 21st of last year, the commission approved that interim rate increase at $9.5 million or 3.8%. These self implemented rates became effective on the first day of this year. And the final decision on new rates in Minnesota is expected by the end of calendar 2018. As part of the rate case, we will work with commission to factor in the impact of tax reform. Next, I would like to discuss our Michigan utilities, and as a reminder, we obtained final regulatory approval on October 25, for the construction of new natural gas fire generation in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Site preparation begins within days of the commission order. Our plan is to bring the new facilities in the commercial service by mid 2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The project calls for a $266 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines, we call these RICE units. They will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for customers in the Upper Peninsula including the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland Cliffs. On tax reform for our Michigan utilities, we submitted a filing on January 19th estimating the impacts of the reductions in tax rates. We're proposing to defer the effects of tax reform in Michigan and factor the balances into our next rate case. So in summary looking ahead through 2018, it should be a relatively quite year from a regulatory standpoint. We have a base rate freeze in place in Wisconsin, and beyond the outstanding rate case in Minnesota, we don\u2019t plan to file a traditional rate case in any of our jurisdictions. Turning now to our five-year capital spending plan, our updated five year plan, you recall we rolled that out in November totals $11.8 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over the previous five year plan. I would note that this does not include our share of the projected capital investments at American Transmission Company. Our updated capital plan is focused on reshaping our generation fleet for a clean reliable future. Our approach calls for greater reliance on natural gas and solar energy to meet customer demand for electricity. In addition to the 180 megawatts of RICE generation that we talked about in Michigan, we plan to add another 50 megawatts of RICE generation in Northern Wisconsin in the Wisconsin Public Service territory by 2021. We also have the option as you recall to invest up to $200 million in the Riverside power plant that's a natural gas fired facility being built by Alliant. And importantly, we plan to expand our renewable generation portfolio. Over the past five years, utility scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices, prices have dropped by approximately 70%, making solar a cost effective option for our customers and option that also fits very well with our summer demand curve. Utility scale solar will not only better balance our energy supply with customer demand but will also help reduce our power supply costs and our CO2 emissions. We're currently in discussions with developers and we plan to file for approvals with the Wisconsin Commission this spring. Finally, you'll recall that our Wisconsin Public Service Utility along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Medicine Gas and Electric have agreed to purchase the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. On January 16th of this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the sale. We are now awaiting Wisconsin Commission final approval. Our customers will see real savings because the purchase of the wind farm will eliminate the existing power purchase agreement. We expect to close on the transaction sometime in the first half of this year. And finally, a word about our dividend policy, at this January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $55.25 per share. That's an increase of 6.25% over the previous rate. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.21 per share, and folks this will mark the 15th consecutive year that our company will reward our shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're at the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now with details on our 2017 results and our outlook for sparkling 2018, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our 2017 GAAP earnings were $3.79 per share compared to $2.96 per share in 2016. The 2017 results include earnings from recurring operations of $3.14 per share and the net impact of one-time non-cash adjustments totaling $0.65 per share. As Gale mentioned, these one-time adjustments reflect the application of the new tax law to the Company's non-utility assets and to the assets of the parent company. Excluding the deferred tax benefit, our 2017 adjusted earnings were $3.14 per share. This is an increase of $0.17 over our 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.97 per share. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted earnings excluded $0.01 of acquisition costs. For the rest of my presentation, I'll refer exclusively to adjusted earnings. Our favorable results were largely driven by effective cost control and additional capital investment. This was partially offset by lower electric sales volume resulting from significant cooler summer weather compared to the summer of 2016. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the comparison of fourth quarter and full year 2017 and 2016 results, both GAAP and adjusted. For 2017 results, I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 12 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2017 was $1.785 billion as compared to adjusted operating income of $1.686 billion in 2016, an increase of nearly a $100 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1.066 billion for 2017, an increase of $39 million from 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expenses were significantly lower. This was partially offset by a lower sales margin closely attributed to the cool summer weather in 2017. Our Illinois segment recorded operating income of $273 million an increase of $33.4 million compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system monetization program and lower operations and maintenance expense. Our Other States segments recognized operating income of $54.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million compared to 2016. This also was primarily driven by lower operating and maintenance expense. Turning to Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure segment, operating income at this segment was up $24.9 million, remember that this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holdings which was acquired on June 30th, as well as the result of We Power. Operating income from our Power the Future plans increased $16.5 million, reflecting additional investments. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $8.4 million to operating income in 2017. The adjusted operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased by $1.9 million year-over-year, taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at nearly a $100 million increase in adjusted operating income. Earnings from our investment in American Transition Company totaled a $154.3 million, an increase of $7.8 million over the last year. In 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of administrative law judge recommendation related to return on equity reviews being conducted by FERC. Our other income net decreased by $16.2 million year-over-year. Recall that we recorded a gain in 2016 related to the repurchase of certain Integrys notes at a discount as well as a gain on the sale of Wisvest. These items were partially offset by higher gains and investments that we recognized in 2017. Our net interest expense increased $13 million year-over-year primarily driven by higher debt levels resulting from continued capital investments. The increase in pre-tax earnings year-over-year drove the $22.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. The adjusted effective tax rate decreased slightly from 37.6% in 2016 to 37.2% in 2017. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. We're still evaluating the full implication of tax reform and as always, we will continue to update you on the changes during our next call. With the latest tax law changes, we do expect to be a cash tax payer by the end of 2018. Combining all these items bring us to adjusted earnings of $997 million or $3.14 per share for 2017 compared to adjusted earnings of $941 million or $2.97 per share for 2016. Looking at the cash flow statement at Page 8 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $23.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was driven by $100 million contribution to our pension plan in January 2017, partially offset by the year-over-year increase in operating income. Our capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion for 2017, a $536 million increase for 2016 reflecting our continued investment in our core infrastructure. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 52.5% at the end of 2017 and increase from 51.9% adjusted debt to capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Some of you have recently asked how tax reform will affect the cash flow and credit matrix. We now expect our FFO to debt metric to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We also paid $657 million in common dividends during the 2017, an increase of $31.6 million over 2016 reflecting the dividend increase last year. Turning now to sales, we continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2017, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 20,000 more natural gas customers than they did a year ago. Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 15 and 16 of the earnings package, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, retail deliveries of our electricity for our Michigan utilities excluding the Iron ore mine were down 1.6% and as weather-normalized basis decrease four tone of 1%. Turning to natural gas deliveries, as you may recall our Illinois segment is largely decoupled and its margins are less affected by weather. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin excluding gas use for power generation were up 4.3%. On weather-normalized basis and excluding gas use for generation natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 3.7% and we're above our expectations. And now I will briefly touch on our 2018 sales forecast for the state of Wisconsin our largest segment. We're forecasting a slight decrease one tenths of one percent in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine. We project Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for generation to increase by three tenths of one percent. At this time, I'd like to discuss our earnings guidance for 2018. As you know, we expect long term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7% of a base of $3.09 per share. This was the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. So, looking ahead, our guidance for 2018 is in the range of $3.26 per share to $3.30 per share. This is in line with our longer term growth expectations. Our guidance assumes normal weather and the estimated impact of tax reform. Finally, let's look at the first quarter of 2018 guidance. In the first quarter of last year, we earned $1.12 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2017 had warmer than normal weather which is offset by effective cost control. Taking these factors into account, we project first quarter 2018 earnings to be in the range of $1.14 per share to a $1.16 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.14 per share to $1.16 per share. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Scott, very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And Sarah, I think we're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. Operator : All right. Thank you. At this time, we'll take your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Greg Gordon : Good outlook, do you think we're going to get Kirk Cousins over in Jet land? Gale Klappa : I am betting on that and it's interesting without Aaron Rodgers, the Packers look like the Jets, Greg. Greg Gordon : Fair enough, fair enough, I think rather have them the Packers even without Aaron and Jets spring. But let me ask you a question on in terms of the impact of tax reform, can you refresh our memories on the rate deal that you have in Wisconsin? My understanding if my memory serves me correctly. Is that you have a regulatory asset associated with the transmission investment that hasn't been rolled into rates, but the tax reform is going to allow you to work down that balance is that correct? Gale Klappa : Greg, you've got a good memory. Actually and this was I think a very positive forward looking approach in the rate settlement, both by the interveners, the commission staff, the commissioners and our company. And it is not a mandated order, but when you look at the wording in the order that approved the rate settlement. It strongly suggests that the benefits of tax reform that we file a plan to apply, some or all of the benefits of tax reform to working down this regulatory asset balance that sits on our balance sheet. And that regulatory asset balance is largely for as you pointed out, transmission costs that we've incurred but we've not yet rolled in the rates, that's a pretty sizeable asset balance roughly about 400 million, if I am correct. Scott Lauber : The transmission is just a little over 200 million. Gale Klappa : Just over 200, okay, so it's pretty sizeable. So, we'll file a plan on February 9th and obviously the follow-through on that -- on that strong suggestion in the rate order that we -- what we used the benefits of tax reform to basically pay down that credit card IOU. So, that's a very positive thing I think, a very forward looking thing that was part of the rate settlement. So to kind of answer your question more broadly, there're kind of three big moving pieces here when we try to estimate the overall impact or the bottom line impact of tax reform. First is, assuming we begin to pay down that asset balance for transmission. The second is, as you know the value of interest deduction is lower with the lower tax rate, so there is a drag at the holding company on holding company interest. And then the third is, the elimination of bonus depreciation effective January of 18th which will add to rate base. So, you kind of put all those three in the blender and our best estimate right now is about a $0.05 to $0.06 drag, on overall earnings per share as the net impact of tax reform. Greg Gordon : But that's baked into your guidance for 2018 and your confidence in your growth rate. So you factor that in to\u2026 Gale Klappa : That is correct. And you know, we're very good at looking ahead and planning, so the idea that there would be some potential drag from tax reform is something that our team's been looking at really since about midyear 2017. So, this wasn't a surprise to us. We were planning to steps that we needed to take to overcome the $0.05 or $0.06 drag, and you're correct, we're still on the 5 to 7% growth track with the guidance that Scott just gave you. Greg Gordon : Last question, if this -- does your capital expenditure budget fully contemplate the capital needs that go along with this Foxconn construction project in terms of all the demand pool and infrastructure that might be required? Or are we going to be looking for an update once you have a full sense of the scope there? Gale Klappa : I think we have tried to factor in as best we know on the electric side. So in terms of electric, Wisconsin Electric Capital, expenditures I think we've done a good job of rolling that in. But as we work now and extensively every week actually with the technical people who are going to be responsible for constructing that huge campus, 23 million square foot campus, I think we and they are beginning to realize that there may be some additional and it could be substantial some additional demand for natural gas capacity that may require some fair amount of capital to make sure we're properly serving their natural gas needs. So, the answer's kind of mixed, yes, I think we've cranked in the electric demand and the capital associated with that. But I think there's going to be some upside on the natural gas capital, and Greg I would expect, we'll start seeing the demand from Foxconn start to really ramp up in 2020, 2021 and certainly 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Since you know, you said that the $0.05 to $0.06 is fully inclusive it's like net all effects. Is that included things like the reduction of deferred tax liabilities, We Power, the amortization overtime? And also, are you expecting to hit the 50 bps threshold at Wisconsin Electric because rate being under the rate freeze? Gale Klappa : Well, first question first. I guess the best way to answer your question about tax reform to the best of our knowledge it's like Ragu, it's all in there. Michael Weinstein : Do you include any sharing from\u2026 Gale Klappa : Our current plan has each as we always have added the good success in doing. Our current plan assumes that each one of our operating units actually earned their allowed rate of return. So, this particular we would not -- we're budgeting for sharing. Michael Weinstein : Does that mean you don\u2019t anticipate happening or is just not budgeted? Gale Klappa : That means at the moment we do not anticipate it happening. Michael Weinstein : What happens to FFO to debt, after the rate free ends in 2019? How long does that regulatory asset amortization continue? And how long does it prop up before the debt? Gale Klappa : Well, right now that will have to be decided in the -- assuming there is a rate case in 2019 in Wisconsin Scott that would have to be decided in that case. Scott Lauber : In that case for effective 2020, but right now we look at our five year plan, we\u2019re in that 16 to 18 range. Prior to tax reform, we have 16 to 19 that's kind of took us off the top of the end of range, but we're comfortable in that 16 to 18 range. Michael Weinstein : So even after perhaps some of the effects of tax reform enrolled into customer rates at some points, you\u2019re thinking 16 to 18 kind of number to the, at least in this five years. Gale Klappa : Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Campanella with Bank of America. Nick Campanella : I just want to go to the 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt. Is that something that the agencies are comfortable with? Just know given Moody's has been in pretty vocal about this for the broader utility group, have you guys said whether you will be willing to defend your ratings? Or how should we kind think about that as we get pass 2019? Gale Klappa : Let me say this and I'm going to ask Scott to give you his technical view on what Moody's are saying. But first of all, we work very hard to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry. So, we\u2019re cognizant of the fact that we want our metrics to merit -- to merit, the kind of ratings we're getting right now. But have been said that, you will notice that in Scott's comments, it's been consistent with what we said along we do not have any plans issue any additional equity. We think we\u2019re going to be able to stay in the kind of 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt as Scott has mentioned, certainly we're not issuing any additional equity. And one of the other things that I think is important historically the Wisconsin Commission which is still where we have the largest percentage of our assets has always been very vigilant and very cognizant of the fact that they want strong credit quality utilities. So, I think you put all that together and we believe we have the capability again without issuing any additional equity to stay in the range. Scott? Scott Lauber : That\u2019s correct, that 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt range basically Moody's at the holding company has us on a negative outlook, which that negative outlook puts us at a rating in that 16% to 18%. I feel very comfortable that we'll maintain that rating then. And like Gale said, no equity issuance needed in the plan. Nick Campanella : And then just moving something else on the wind PPA, where you're replacing this with an ownership option. Are there other situations across your jurisdictions where we could be looking towards similar strategy, anything that we should pay attention to do there? Gale Klappa : Well, I would say not necessarily in 2018, but watch the space. Operator : Your next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Leslie Rich : I had a question on your utility scale solar investment. Just wondering, how much you're thinking you might allocate towards that in terms of CapEx, and if that's part of your five year plan or that would be incremental? Gale Klappa : It is part of the five year plan and we're looking at the specifics right now. We're tentatively -- again we have -- we're still talking with developers. But if I were to venture a guess, I think it would be too pretty sizeable size, perhaps one in the Wisconsin Public Service area in Northern Wisconsin. But again, we're looking right now and talking with a number of developers. And Scott, it is in our five year plan. Scott Lauber : Yes, it's in our five year plan, and it's really in the couple of segments. Early on, I would say about 300 million to 400 million in the first few years, and then we have about 350 million in the later part of the five year plan. Gale Klappa : And Leslie, we expect to make some final decisions and file for a construction authority approval with the Wisconsin Commission this spring. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : Just a question on tax reform at the unregulated businesses, I assume, We Power just flows through to a predetermined ROE, but what happens at Bluewater and ATC? Gale Klappa : Scott? Scott Lauber : So, at Bluewater, that was contemplated in the affiliate interest agreements with the three Wisconsin utility. So that would get pass through the affiliate interest agreement and get passed through to our customers through their purchase gas adjustment clause. So that will get factored in and then customers will receive the benefit. At ATC of course they're formula rates there and those formula rates will get passed through then to our utilities. As a reminder that also would help the escrow balance at our utilities, at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Gale Klappa : So the thought would be that the change in tax rates that benefits ATC would flow through and we would use that to reduce the asset balance for uncollected transmission cost. Scott Lauber : Correct. Paul Ridzon : In Wisconsin that's dollar for dollar, so there's no really earnings impact there? Gale Klappa : Correct. That is correct. Paul Ridzon : And then in Michigan, just some clarification, we've over earned in Michigan because you're saving that -- those taxes for later. Are you going to hang up the regulatory liabilities for those? Gale Klappa : No, we would hang it up on our balance sheet and track it. And then factor it into the next rate case. That is what we filed. I will see what the Michigan Commission responds with. Paul Ridzon : And who you're looking for Gale? Don't they pay you, any other answer will work. Gale Klappa : A sentimental thing, Doug Pederson, the Head Coach of Eagles used to be the quarterbacks coach when Brett Favre was Green Bay. So there is a sentimental attachment there where Brady's have to be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your last question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Real quickly, first of all gas demand and I may have misheard, but it seems like you're putting a pretty conservative number in 2018 guidance for weather-normalized gas demand especially and if you can -- you or Scott can remind us, the levels of weather-normalized gas demand that you've realized over the last few years? Scott Lauber : Well, certainly last year, 2017 our weather-normalized demand growth with natural gas, this is at retail now excluding power generation was up more than 3%. That's a surprisingly good number and the economy is strong but not knowing how sustainable that is and Scott I actually talked in this morning, our customer growth has been about 1% on the natural gas side. So you know, not knowing how sustainable that kind of 3 percentage kind of growth is we've achieved, three-tenths of 1%. Michael you're correct it\u2019s been about 3% the last couple of years and we think that's related to conversions and the stability of natural gas prices we've also seen some industrial customers convert to natural gas. I just don't think those conversions once they convert, I don't know if they'll continue and every time and plant gets replaced, it\u2019s more efficient. Just to put it in perspective though about a 1% increase in natural gas demand adds about a $0.05 or about $3 million to earnings. So, it's not, you know it's very nice. So, if we get a little more growth that'll be all positive, but it's not extremely large number. Gale Klappa : And Michael, as we get closer to 2020, 2021 you'll probably see us revive our gas demand because of what we expect to be pretty sizeable demand from Foxconn. Michael Lapides : Right, understood, one other question, you've got a bit of build for short term debt balance at the end of the year. We've seen rate move and how are you thinking about we are hedging whether we are terming out some of that short term debt or other actions you can take to potentially you know head off at the past what could be a very, a minor EPS headwind just from simply higher rates? Gale Klappa : Well couple of things and first of all, we do have a pretty robust financing plan for 2018 and there may be some opportunities there that we're certainly looking at. However, in our budget in our guidance and in our forecast, we have assumed in terms of short term interest rates, we've assumed four out of four quarter point increases from the Fed, one every quarter in 2018. And I think that's a reasonable assumption. So basically, we've got a very, I think a very appropriate interest rate forecast baked into our guidance, and then there maybe some opportunity with our financings over the course of the year to do better. Michael Lapides : Got it, last thing in your estimates for ATC your transmission earnings. Can you remind us, what ROE, are you booking for GAAP income statement purposes? Gale Klappa : Well, on our longer term estimate, because we expect that allowed ROE from FREC will come down. Our longer term projection is 10 :2 and Scott we\u2019re booking a little better than that right now. Scott Lauber : Right now, we\u2019re currently booking 10.82, which is based on the first decision for this first case decision. We're assuming that gives results sometime in the middle of this year, but long-term we do have that 10.2 factored into our forecast. Michael Lapides : So in other words, the ATC earnings power for at least half of this year. Has an elevated ROE that you, when you think about your multiyear growth rate, you don\u2019t use when you kind think about 2019 and beyond? Gale Klappa : Correct, you got it, you nailed it. And I will say this, everybody speculating about the new members of FERC and the methodology they might use to set is on a reasonable this. I personally and I could be wrong, but I personally do not see the FERC lowering transmission ROEs below state ROEs. Just be countered everything that FERC is trying to accomplish. So, we feel very comfortable with the 10.2. Gale Klappa : All right. Well, folks, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for taking part. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact Beth Straka, her direct line, and operators are waiting 414-221-4639. Thanks everybody. Take care.",

Analysts: Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2018 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectation at the time that they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Mr. Klappa, the floor is yours. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the opening quarter of 2018. But first, I know that all of you are interested in an update on Allen Leverett's recovery from the stroke he suffered last October. I can report that Allen is in very good physical condition, and he continues to be engaged in intensive speech therapy at a leading rehabilitation center. The center specializes in helping patients who are having difficulty speaking fluently. Over the past few months, Allen has continued to make progress. He is working hard and he remains upbeat and determined. Now, many of you have also asked about our succession planning in the event that Allen can't or chooses not to return as CEO. As you would expect, we conduct rigorous succession planning discussions with our board on a regular basis. Guys, we've done so for many, many years. So, I can assure you that we have a solid plan B in place if Allen does not assume his previous role. The plan would involve a number of internal promotions. We would have great continuity going forward and the board and I are very comfortable with what I call plan B. We'll continue to monitor the situation during the second and third quarters of this year and we'll certainly keep you up to date on any new developments. Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $1.23 a share, well ahead of guidance. Stronger than expected demand for natural gas and electricity, the strengthening economy and efficiency gains across our system were the major factors in our solid first quarter performance. Scott will provide you with more details in just a few minutes but, first, I'd like to update you on a number of recent developments. Just yesterday, we signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. This wind farm is currently being built by Invenergy in Antelope County, Nebraska. Upstream will consist of 81 GE wind turbines with a capacity of 200 megawatts. We plan to invest approximately $280 million for our 80% ownership stake. Key permits and local approvals have been obtained for construction and operation, and we expect to close the transaction in early 2019 likely in February as the wind farm begins commercial service. Under the new tax rules, the investment in Upstream will qualify for 100% bonus depreciation and for production tax credits. The project has a long-term 10-year offtake agreement with a company that has a strong investment grade credit rating. We project this $280 million investment will earn a return similar to that of our regulated utilities. The transaction, of course, is subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I'm also pleased to inform you that on March 1, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center. Our Wisconsin Public Service utility along with several partners closed the transaction on April 2. We now own 44.6% of this facility with an investment of approximately $80 million. Our customers will soon see real savings because the purchase of the wind farm eliminates a higher cost power purchase agreement. And now, an update on tax reform proceedings that recently took place in Wisconsin. As you may recall, the Commission order that approved our rate settlement last fall contemplated the potential impact of tax reform. The order recommended that benefits from a lower tax rate be used to reduce our regulatory asset balances, particularly those for uncollected transmission costs. In filings over the past few months, we proposed a formal plan with several options for the Commission to consider. Last Thursday, the Wisconsin Commission determined that 80% of the tax benefit would be used to offset regulatory asset balances, with the remaining 20% to be refunded in the form of bill credits. This decision applies to the electric customers of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. For our natural gas customers in Wisconsin, the full amount of the tax savings will flow to customers through lower bills. We believe this was a thoughtful and balanced decision by the Commission. Also, on the regulatory front in Wisconsin, we expect to file for construction authority for our first solar farm by the end of the second quarter. Over the past few years, as you may know, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost effective option for our customers, an option that also fits very well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Our effort to reshape our generating fleet for a clean and reliable future is especially important at this time of great economic potential for the State of Wisconsin. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin reached a record low of 2.9% in March. That's the eighth lowest unemployment rate in America. Meanwhile, more people are working in Wisconsin. More people have jobs in Wisconsin than in any other time in state history. And we are seeing additional potential as Foxconn Technology Group has begun its $10 billion investment in a massive high-tech manufacturing campus south of Milwaukee. Foxconn's construction team has set a goal to have 60% of the project completed by Wisconsin-based companies and 70% of the job hours worked by Wisconsin residents. Of course, we have plans that are now being developed and underway to provide both natural gas and electric infrastructure to the area that is now being called Wisconn Valley. The large scale development will provide additional investment opportunities for us, including approximately $140 million of gas projects and $120 million of transmission upgrades now being planned by American Transmission Company. And one final Wisconsin note, you may have read that several interveners in last year's rate settlement have asked the Commission to require a deferral of the non-fuel savings from the closure of the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. They seem concerned that during the year and next we will reap some type of windfall from eliminating the operating costs of the plant. So, to clear up any confusion, there is no possibility of a windfall because we agreed to an earnings cap at Wisconsin Electric for the period of the rate freeze, which covers all of 2018 and all of 2019. Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make real progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Plan. As a reminder, this program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. For many years to come, we'll be replacing outdated natural gas piping, some of which was installed back in the day of Abraham Lincoln with state-of-the-art materials. We're currently on track to invest approximately $290 million in the effort during calendar year 2018. In addition, we've been working with the Illinois Commission on a bill credit to flow savings from the new federal tax law back to customers and on April 19, the Commission voted unanimously to approve the proposed bill rider. The rider takes into account the impact of Federal tax savings which are partially offset by an increase in Illinois state taxes. A typical Chicago gas customer will see a savings of approximately $2 per month. And now an update on our operations in Minnesota, on October 13 of last year, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Recall that in our initial filing, we requested an increase in base rates of approximately $12.6 million or 5%. Interim rates have been in place since the beginning of this year and on April 1, those interim rates were adjusted to incorporate the positive impact of tax reform. A final decision on new permanent rates in Minnesota is expected by the end of this year. I might add that we're making excellent progress on our gas expansion project in the Rochester area, where the Mayo Clinic is growing rapidly. We've completed the first phase of a multi-year plan to strengthen and expand our infrastructure for natural gas delivery. And next, we'll turn to Michigan. As a reminder, we obtained a final regulatory approval on October 25 of last year for the construction of new natural gas fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. The project stands now at 42% complete. Our plan is to bring the new units into commercial service by mid-2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. This project calls for a $266 million investment in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them RICE units. They'll be capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for customers in the Upper Peninsula. And regarding tax reform for our Michigan utilities, we're working through a multi-step process to flow the benefits back to customers. And finally, a reminder about our dividend. At our January meeting, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.5525 per share, that's an increase of 6.25% over the previous dividend rate. Our annualized dividend now stands at $2.21 per share. And folks, this marks the 15th consecutive year that our stockholders will enjoy higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings; we're right in the middle of that range now. So, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be aligned with the growth in our earnings per share. And now, with details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2018, here is our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Gale. Our 2018 first quarter earnings grew to $1.23 per share compared to $1.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Our favorable results were largely driven by colder weather quarter-over-quarter, effective cost control and return on additional capital investment. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2018 and 2017 results. I'll first focus on operating income and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 8 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $545.1 million compared to operating income of $614.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $69.6 million. Excluding two tax items totaling $120 million, operating income actually increased $50.4 million. The first tax item relates to the effective tax reform and the second item is the benefit of tax repairs as part of our Wisconsin rate settlement. You'll recall that our regulated utilities are currently deferring the benefits associated with the Tax Cut (sic) [Cuts] and Jobs Act of 2017. These benefits will ultimately be returned to customers. The accounting for this charge results in lower income tax expense and an offset to operating revenues. As part of our Wisconsin rate resettlement, we also agreed to use the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. These escrow balances represent costs Wisconsin Electric incurred to provide electric service, but were set aside for future recovery. So, here's how it affects our financial reporting. The income statement accounting for tax repairs does three things. It decreases income tax expense, increases O&M, and reduces operating revenues related to these regulatory balances. All of this has no effect on net income. I'd like to refer you to page 7 of the earnings package where you can see each of the line items. Excluding the impact of these items, operating income increased $50.4 million. The following segments discussed will now focus only on the remaining $50.4 million increase in operating income. Starting with our Wisconsin segment, the remaining increase in operating income was $30.2 million. The impact from colder winter weather increased margins $20.4 million and lower operations and maintenance expense contributed an additional $11.9 million. In the first quarter of 2018, the remaining increase in operating income in our Illinois segment was $6.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was primarily driven by continued investment in the Gas System Modernization Program and lower operations and maintenance expense. Due to decoupling, the colder weather did not have a significant impact on Illinois margins. The remaining increase in operating income at our other states segment was $8.2 million. The change was primarily due to colder winter weather quarter-over-quarter and lower operations and maintenance expense. Turning to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at this segment increased $8.2 million. Remember that this segment contains the operation of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding which was acquired on June 30 of last year as well as the results of We Power. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $7.8 million in the increase of operating income in the first quarter of 2018. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased $3 million quarter-over-quarter. We transferred completed software assets from our centralized service company to our regulated utilities. Accordingly, the return on these assets is now recognized by our regulated utilities. Excluding the two tax items we discussed, operating income increased $50.4 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $32.8 million, a decrease of $9.1 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding the $10.7 million impact of tax reform, our equity earnings grew $1.6 million due to continued capital investment. Our other income, net, decreased by $10.8 million quarter-over-quarter driven by decreasing gains on investments. Our net interest expense increased $2 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by higher debt levels resulting from continued capital investments and higher short-term interest rates. Our consolidated income taxes decreased $125 million, as previously discussed lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow through of tax repairs. We expect our effective income tax rate will be between 13% and 14% this year. Excluding the benefit of related tax repairs, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. Combining all these items brings us to earnings of $390.1 million or $1.23 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to earnings of $356.6 million or $1.12 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $179 million during the first quarter of 2018. Recall that we made a $100 million contribution to our pension plan in the first quarter of last year. Also, earnings improved quarter-over-quarter. Our capital expenditures totaled $440 million in the first quarter, a $110 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we continue to execute on our capital plan. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of the first quarter, a decrease from the 52.5% at the end of 2017. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinated notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We continue to expect our FFO to debt metric to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We paid $174 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $10 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 6.25% increase in the dividend level compared to the first quarter of 2017. Now, a brief update on sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of the first quarter, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric customers and 27,000 more natural gas customers than they did a year ago. Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 10 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity for our Wisconsin and Michigan utilities, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 1.6% and were level with the first quarter of 2017 on a weather normal basis. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding gas used for power generation, increased 11.2%. On a weather normal basis and excluding gas used for generation, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 4.9% and were above our expectations. Finally an update on earnings guidance, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance of $3.26 a share to $3.30 a share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year. We expect our second quarter 2018 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 that takes into account April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the conference call. Operator : Thank you. Now we will take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Greg. How are you? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I am good. Hi, Gale. Hi, team. So I just want to know... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yes, sir. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You must have directed the Jets draft. You had a good draft. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Well, I told them they had to pick a quarterback that would be able to throw over the heads of the two corners the Green Bay Packers drafted, so... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: These guys got good vertical leap, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Excellent. Sorry about your bucks by the way. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : But onto the questions, can you talk a little bit more about the strategic rationale behind the wind purchase? Because the way that you described it, it's not clear to me that you're selling that power back to your utilities or that that's sort of an asset that would ultimately be requested to go into rate base. And if so, to whom is the PPA, whether that's disposable and how should we think about that? Because it seems like a step out from your normal sort of band of how you think about your strategy. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. No, I appreciate the question. It's a very good question. And, first of all, we have, as you probably saw when you look through the basic description of our capital plan over the next five years, the $11.8 billion capital plan that we're projecting for the next five years, we have a segment in there that we basically call energy infrastructure. And we put that in there frankly because we are beginning to see some opportunities, if you will, for the potential purchase of assets that some other companies are divesting, but they are good assets, they are assets that don't change our risk profile and that's a very important point with us as you know. But they are assets that can add to earnings, that can help us deploy capital in a very good way, that don't add to rate pressure at the retail level in Wisconsin or anywhere else. And in this case, although I think we're under a confidentiality agreement on the exact name of the off-taker, there is a 10-year offtake with this particular upstream property with a A-rated publicly-traded company. So they take all of the offtake for the entire 10-year contract and, of course, it does qualify as I mentioned for 100% bonus depreciation and for the production tax credits. So, we thought this was a really interesting opportunity for us. It's kind of the first major project that we're putting into that infrastructure category. I want to emphasize that well, it may be just a hair different than what we've done in the past. We are not going to change our risk profile by stretching for assets that don't fit the kind of return and risk adjusted returns that we've always tried to deliver. So, this may be the first of a number that you see in that category, but again the concept is taking advantage of some opportunities but not changing our risk profile. And down the road, we're going to need carbon-free energy as well. So I wouldn't rule out 10 or 15 years from now thinking about putting that asset in a rate base, but that's not the current thinking. The current thinking is that this is a solid asset without ever entering into a rate base in Wisconsin. Does that make sense to you, Greg? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Perfectly. And on that note, since I don't really have any question specific to the quarter, you're as usual off to a great start for the year in terms of your earnings goals. This is actually a debate that investors do have from time-to-time when looking at the current retail rate that your customers pay versus others in the region and thinking about as you deploy capital how are you incrementally going to be able to make that cost effective? And people sometimes talk about the escalator in your nuclear contract as being a headwind for that. Can you talk about the future levers you have to pull to continue to be able to offer a cost effective product as you do deploy capital inside the utility because in conversations I've had with you you seemed pretty confident that there is a long runway to be able to do that where others are more skeptical? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, again a very good question. And yes, I am confident in part. Well, first of all, let me back up. We will be \u2013 in 2019, next year, we will be in year number four of a retail rate freeze at Wisconsin. During that four-year period, virtually every utility around us has had to raise rates. When you look at our rates now, in fact, the Wisconsin Commission just put out a draft, the energy assessment. They do this every several years and they talk now about Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Commission in its draft report just last week talked about how the average bill in Wisconsin for the median income person in Wisconsin is lower than the region. So, we're starting to see others that provide electricity in the region have to raise rates as they move into their cycle of significant building. So, I feel very good about where we're headed from a competitive standpoint in offering a competitively priced product, number one. Number two, how we can continue to do that. I mean, I believe we have a long runway of O&M cost savings ahead of us. We've announced, for example, two more power plant closures, the Pulliam plant at Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. And, of course, we've been planning to close the Presque Isle Power Plant for a number of years. You put the O&M for those plants together and you're talking about close to $100 million annual O&M. So, we have a lot of cost saving initiatives. We have a lot of efficiency initiatives that are really coming out of our acquisition of Integrys, plus the opportunity now to actually green our fleet and save O&M costs. So, I feel very good about deploying the capital plan that we've laid out, the $11.8 billion plan over the next five years without any significant rate pressure in Wisconsin. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Greetings, Shar. How are you today? Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Oh, great. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. We're doing well. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. So just a real quick question on the tax filing. How does \u2013 just remind us how the verbal order from last week sort of compares to your plan assumptions, mainly focusing on the uncollected transmission cost balance? I mean, I guess at a cursory level looks like it's more constructive than what you assumed from your plan. So, there's obviously some positive cash flow impacts. And then also, is there any impact of the timing of your next rate case? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Shar, on your second question, no, there's no timing on the impact of the next rate case resulting from the tax reform decision by the Commission, none whatsoever. And in terms of how we view that compared to plan, if you recall, during the filings over the last few months, we proposed several alternatives for the Commission and I guess I would view the Commission's decision, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as both balanced and thoughtful. I think it's right down the center of the fairway. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, that's correct. It's 80% applied to those regulatory assets, largely the transmission asset at Wisconsin Electric, and what that'll do, is as you know, the balance of that account was going to be about $220 million at the end of 2019. Applying the benefits that the Commission did on tax reform here will lower it and then you put the benefits that we receive for tax reform for the American Transmission Company that balance at the end of two years will be about $40 million, so makes significant progress on reducing that balance. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We thought it was a very... Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Right. And... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm sorry, go ahead, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : No, no, sorry. Go, you Gale, start with it. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. We thought it was a very \u2013 again a very thoughtful recent decision and really will make a big, big dent as Scott said in the unrecovered balance for transmission costs. And by the way, I wanted you to know that Greg promised if you were checking on him on Thursday, he'd be working. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : We'll see about that. I appreciate that. And then just let me ask you on Foxconn, maybe as you sort of think about the growth trajectory that you guys have out there and what's within plan, can you just, Gale, talk a little bit about some of the incremental opportunities, mainly on potential rooftop solar with Foxconn, incremental gas distribution needs, so as Foxconn facility continues to progress, how we should think about items that may not be \"embedded\" in your outlook? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Good question, Shar. First of all, a little bit of background, earthmoving at the site of the Foxconn campus site will begin in the next few weeks and so much of soil has to be moved during the excavation process that excavation in and of itself will take until August of 19 to complete. If you take a standard football field, the 100-yard football field, enough earth has to be moved to basically fill that football field 1,475 times, means it's just an enormous, enormous project. So, basically all of the field work will begin in just a few weeks. I would think that we will start to see peak construction in 2020. And yes, there will be and there are incremental investment opportunities for us, both related to electricity and natural gas but the bigger surprise for us really is the level of natural gas demand. I think I may have mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's probably an additional $120 million of investments that we're going to need in natural gas delivery, in the infrastructure there, to get gas to that complex. And to the development that is now \u2013 we're now starting to see as you would imagine, we're now starting to see other developments announced. Someone just announced a new hotel just 6 miles from the Foxconn campus. So we're going to see the spin-off or the ripple effect development soon. And American Transmission Company has already filed for about $120 million transmission upgrade and there will be more to come. Now, in terms of our sales numbers though, Scott will update in the fall when we have our new capital plan, we'll update our sales growth projections that we'll probably start to see some reasonable incremental demand from Foxconn I would say late 2020, 2021. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right. That's helpful, Gale. And then just one last thing on sort of incremental opportunities. I think you've highlighted before in the past and you touched a little bit about the win. But given what you've seen is a lot of your peers that have been looking to mitigate some of their equity needs as a result of tax reform and then other various scenarios, is there also sort of an opportunity for you to look at contracted midstream assets? Are you finding given sort of the impact of tax reform of some of your peers that you may have some more willing sellers and is that something you'd be interested in looking at? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Shar, the short answer is yes. But, we will not do an investment that changes our risk profile. So \u2013 but there are a number of opportunities really even in the Midwest that we're seeing today that we would not have seen last year simply because of the impact of tax reform and other companies wanting, as you say, to mitigate the need for new equity. I mean, we're in a very fortunate position where we don't need new equity and we have some ability to take advantage of the opportunity to buy really strong assets that don't change our risk profile. So, I guess as they would say in the UK, watch this space. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful and congrats to a great start, Gale, and have a good week. Thanks, guys. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, Gale. How are you doing? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Michael. I'm good, Michael. Did you apply for your job at FOX Sports? Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: They recruited me, but I'm going to have to turn it down for now. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: There you go. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, I've heard from Michigan that there is a development of a winter peak almost a double peak in that state, that effectively what it does is it lowers the capacity factor that could be applied to solar, in other words, it wouldn't get as much of a, you know, maybe a lower capacity factor as a result of the double peak. I'm just wondering, I guess in that state, you're talking about a 50% CapEx or I think in Wisconsin, you guys are talking about 70%; I mean if you've heard anything like along these lines? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, not at this point. And right now for \u2013 again it's MISO that basically assigns the capacity factor. And right now to the best of our knowledge that remains at 70% in Wisconsin. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And on Foxconn's move, have you heard anything at this early stage about maybe additional companies looking to move to the stage to be part of the ecosystem that's being developed there at this point? I think you call what Wisc Valley or Wisconsin Valley? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, Wisconn Valley. It's the Midwest version of Silicon Valley. There has been nothing specific announced yet, but I can tell you just from being involved in the project that there are multiple companies that would become a need to become part of the Foxconn supply chain that are in the early stages of figuring out how they're going to locate and become actually part of that supply chain. But I am encouraged by one other development, and that is Foxconn is really looking hard at a number of Wisconsin companies to become part of their supply chain. So, companies that are existing here that would get more revenue, more production, more income by becoming part of the supply chain. So, I think it's going to be a combination of a number of companies moving to the state, but also a number of companies that are going to get additional business from the fact that they will be suppliers to Foxconn, but I think you'll start to see some announcements here in the next few months. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. And I'm glad to hear that Allen is doing well. All right. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Afternoon, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, afternoon. Thanks for taking the time. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, wanted to follow up a little bit on the balance sheet here, FFO to debt. I think you guys talked about a 16% to 18% ratio. Just going back to Shar's question for a quick minute here. Can you elaborate a little bit on where that puts you within that range given the outcome of the tax reform and the sharing that you all described in the transmission costs? And then I suppose secondarily as for the small piece of that, but the $280 million associated with the energy, I suppose it doesn't really move the needle all that much against the backdrop of that. But I suppose one could be perceived as offsetting the other? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, and I don't think so. First of all, I'll let Scott handle the 16% to 18%. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: So the 16% to 18%, it's going to move around a little in there, I would say 2018 because we are part year cash taxpayer, not a full year, we'll be at the top end of that 2018, maybe even squeak into close to 19%. Later on in the plan, it's in that 16%, it's right in the middle of the range I would say. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: But it's certainly not down in the 15% area. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I mean, we're above that, and in some point, as Scott said, we might even see 19% Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Early out in the plan here while we're not paying taxes, so that's why we're looking at other opportunities on the tax front, so we've a tax appetite to help. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Exactly. And in terms of the Upstream Wind Energy Center that we just announced, that could be a couple of cents a share. So, it's not $0.20 a share, but I think it's indicative of the fact that we are seeing some opportunities again that don't change our risk profile where we can deploy capital. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. And in fact, actually just to specify that since you bring it up, when you say the return profile is similar, the ROE, sort of the upfront earned ROE there, as you say a couple of cents is relatively comparable, right? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That is correct. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And in fact, if I can keep going on that, I mean, you alluded to it already here in tax appetite, I mean in stepping into this contract in renewable world, clearly there is a desire for those paying cash taxes out there to absorb some of those tax attributes. Is that something we could very well see you kind of as a step two in the strategy? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It's certainly a possibility, Julien, absolutely. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Excellent. And then anything with respect to green tariffs for your own customers as you think about kind of satiating the demand from this evolving customer base? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, a couple points on that. We already have a pretty successful green tariff, it's called Energy for Tomorrow. And we have no issue with expanding that tariff whatsoever, as a number of our customers want to have some or all of their energy be green energy. But I do see there are some additional potential opportunities for us to make investments with customers where we would own the renewable and they would be an off-taker. So a lot of interest there, a lot of changes in the marketplace as both solar and wind have become more cost effective. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. Thank you, all. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay, Julien. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon. How are you? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: I'm very good. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're doing well. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Excellent. Well, thanks for all the detailed answers so far. I just had a clarification on the FFO to debt question and around the Wisconsin tax reform settlement. Just to understand, how much is the amortization and how much is the customer refund that you are resuming right now over the next two years as a part of that tax reform settlement? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, Scott is looking for a particular piece of information. I'll try to give you the answer to the first question. On our transmission escrow balance, we're just north of $200 million going into 2018. And I think as Scott said earlier, with basically with 80% of the benefits of tax reform flowing to reduce that transmission escrow coupled with the fact that there's going to be lower a benefit from tax reform from American Transmission Company as well that will help lower that balance. We think we'll take it all the way down to around $40 million by the end of 2019. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, that is correct. So \u2013 but if you look at Wisconsin Electric, the electric customers, it's about $70 million that's going to go against the regulatory asset with about $10 million to $12 million going back as bill credits. And in Wisconsin Public Service, we'll have about $28 million going against the regulatory assets and about $5 million going back as bill credits. And then the rest of the system, as Gale said, all the gas is going to go back as bill credits. So in total, when you look at electric and gas together, it's about $50 million going as bill credits to our customers and about nearly $100 million going against the balance sheet. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: I got you. So that's helpful. So that $50 million that's going back as a bill credit is effectively a reduction in FFO that's incorporated in your FFO to debt metrics as we think about your 16% to 18%? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct and exactly. So this is an annual number, that's the 2018 effect, and then similar in 2019. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And that's how we get from over $200 million down to $40 million, given that escrow balance for transmission. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Got you, and that's super helpful detail. Thank you. And then just more a big picture just stepping back question. In terms of the renewable asset purchases, I know you've talked about the ROE, but in terms of an IRR, I just wanted to think about, given the cash tax profile, I guess you want the cash taxpayer in 2018. So the returns get pushed out a little bit in terms of your ability to utilize the tax attributes of these assets. What kind of IRR thresholds are you looking at as you look at renewable purchases? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I think you may have one little fact just slightly off. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, so this transaction will close in 2019. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: February, we think of 2019. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. And we'll be a full cash taxpayer then. So we'll get the full benefits of the production tax credits, and we'll also since this is not considered utility property, it's outside the utility, we'll get 100% bonus depreciation also on those assets. And we look at it as if we're buying in the utility and what that regulated return would be around that 10% or 11%. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. We'll probably finance just like we do our normal assets, 50% equity, 50% debt, if that helps. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And that's all internal funding of the equity, no external shares we're issuing, none. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct. Correct. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Got you. Got you. That's helpful. So that lines up well, I guess with your cash tax profile in 2019 in terms of the close of this deal. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Exactly. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Okay. And then... Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You must have been in the room when we were talking about this. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: I guess, just a final question, I heard you mention a little bit of opportunity around the midstream side, and looking at some assets on that side or an opportunity on that side. Is that something you're looking at as a cash transaction? Is that how you're thinking of it? And if yes, what kind of holding company debt would you be looking to kind of take on as you look at some of these transactions? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I think one of your colleagues brought that up as a potential example. Let me go back to our five-year capital plan. And when you look at the pie chart that breaks down our $11.8 billion of capital spend over the next five years, you will see a segment called energy infrastructure and that segment is designed for us to deploy capital into the types of things we're talking about opportunistically. So, whether that's a fully contracted midstream pipe or whether that's a fully contracted wind farm or whether that's an investment with a customer that we would invest in solar or a gas storage. So there's a whole range of energy infrastructure type projects that we are going to be analyzing and looking at, as part of that five-year capital plan. This is the first entry into that segment. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. So in addition, we're looking at our holding company debt and like Gale said over that five-year plan that holding company debt to total debt to be 30% or less. Now, if some great opportunities come earlier in the plan, that percentage may go up a little bit and then we'll work it back down like we have done in the past when there are opportunities exist. So we did Bluewater gas storage. Now we have this one. If there's other opportunities out there we can take advantage of and get a return without changing the profile, we'll be looking at that. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. But the general concept is, as Scott just said so well, holding company debt to total debt at about 30%. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're more than welcome. Great questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Greetings, Paul. How are you today? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Well, Gale. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're fine. We're just fine. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I think you probably just answered my question, but this Upstream is not an incremental capital, it was already baked into the forecast with a placeholder? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That is correct. Yes. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then you alluded to the fact that you're kicking tires out there. How big could this get? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, again, we've nailed down a segment for the next five years and the total amount in that segment, Scott, is roughly... Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It's approximately $1 billion over that five years. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. And I think there are opportunities that could certainly take us to that level over the five-year period. So, for the next five years, think about and maybe an incremental $700 million on top of where we are today. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And where is Upstream going to sit in the corporate structure? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It will be a separate sub... Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It will be in that infrastructure segment... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: ...where we have our We Power assets, our Bluewater Holding, and then this will also be in the infrastructure segment. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. So it'll be a separate sub in the infrastructure segment. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just to clarify, I think I heard you say no external equity but possibly tax equity? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No external equity. It'll all be funded internally. We do have the benefit of the production tax credits since we are a cash taxpayer starting at the end of 2018. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, so read our lips, no new equity issuance. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: But could you say you might be tax equity investors? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: If that opportunity exists and we could get a reasonable return. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, we'd have to be both of those things, and overall not changing our risk profile. And if you'd like to go the Antelope County in Nebraska to see the Upstream under construction, we'd be happy to take you there. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I think I'll pass on that one. All right. Go Cav (48:12). Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, Gale, hi, Scott. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you doing? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you, Michael? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm fine. I'll take you up on the Nebraska and buy you a tune of the seven states in the Union I've not been to. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: All right, there you go. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: But let's find a Saturday and college football. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That would be excellent. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: One or two questions, I want to make sure I understood some of the Foxconn comments. Are you effectively raising your $11 plus billion CapEx guidance for the next few years based on some of the commentary about gas infrastructure needs and ATC related needs for Foxconn? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Not yet. I mean that may come depending upon the ancillary development, the additional development that we think will occur in that area, but at the moment, we're sticking with the $11.8 billion. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And just to make sure I understand the net cash impact of all of the different tax reform items that are kind of floating around. How should we think about what that does to just total cash flow over the next one or two years? How much does that bring cash flow down? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So there's a couple items. One, the bill credits that we're giving on an annual basis is going to be approximately $50 million in 2018 and 2019. Now, the other cash flow item is with the change in tax reform, we were going to be a cash taxpayer in 2019 and that moved up to 2018. So that's probably another I would say, $80 million to $100 million additional cash flow drag on the system that we have factored in into our FFO to debt metrics. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. So the total new impact for the Wisconsin kind of settlement that was discussed at the PSCW meeting last week, is really the electric bill credits, the $50 million. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. That's electric and gas bill credits, correct. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. That's together electric and gas. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. One question on solar, want to make sure I understand what do you think kind of like the levelized cost of solar in Wisconsin likely is? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, we're seeing some pretty interesting numbers but under $1,300 on installed kW. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And capacity factors that gets you into \u2013 if it were a PPA or if it were a rate-based asset, are we talking about something in the 30s per megawatt hour or above or below that level? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Ballpark $0.03, yeah. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Thank you, guys, much appreciate it. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're more than welcome, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Greetings, Caroline. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. So a lot of my questions have been answered, but I thought I'd just ask. You've obviously had a lot of success driving lower O&M since the Integrys deal and I know going forward, you expect to see a lot of savings from plant closures. But I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about what's been driving the cost reductions, particularly in Q1? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I wouldn't just be happy to chat about that, I wouldn't necessarily separate out Q1 from any of the other type of progress that we've made because Q1 was a continuation of really the efforts that we've had underway since the acquisition of Integrys. So let me start first by saying the Integrys acquisition has allowed us to really streamline operations across our seven operating utilities. We now have six of the seven companies on the same billing platform. I mean, just to give you an example of now that we have most of our companies on the same customer information and billing system, we can optimize our call centers. We can reduce costs and improve quality. And that's just one example of thousands of examples of what the broader footprint and platform that we have now that we're the eighth largest natural gas distributor in America and one of the 13 largest publicly traded utility systems in the country, with 4.5 million customers. I mean, we just have tremendous opportunities that continue to surface related to driving efficiency and cost savings across the system. So we are \u2013 I mean there isn't any question about it. We are exceeding our initial projections on cost savings and efficiencies from the Integrys acquisition. But it is not one single thing. I mean it is every area where we're seeing gains and where our managers are really doing a good job driving efficiency. It's every single group, it's every single department, it's every single area of the company, and I'm looking at our new Executive Vice President and General Counsel, our Legal \u2013 no, I'm kidding. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That will come too. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thank you. I guess then my other question is just on you mentioned obviously the stories about customers asking for you guys to defer non-fuel savings related to Pleasant Prairie and I was just curious as to when you expect the PSC to actually rule on that? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, first of all, my understanding of this particular docket is that the Commission has 60 days from the receipt of the request to decide even whether to take up the issue. So we will make a response shortly to the request. But again, when you look at the request, it's really \u2013 I mean, we're being very consistent with the rate settlement and our promises in the rate settlement. I mean, we said, for example, multiple times during the process of the rate review last year that in order to maintain the financial integrity of the company and for these rates, we would have to cut about $115 million of costs out of the company. Well, the closure of Pleasant Prairie is just one of many initiatives. And I think that somehow as I mentioned, there may be some concern that oh, my goodness, we'll have some windfall but as you know, as part of the rate settlement, we're earnings capped so there will be no windfall here. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, right. Okay, thanks. And then actually just one follow-up on the wind deal. So, you are guys are going to be buying an operating project once it's completed or actually involved in the building? Sorry to just clarify that. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. Very good question. We will be buying 80% of an operating project once it starts operating. Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're more than welcome. Very good questions. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Dan, you still have a job, that's fantastic. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Another week or two, I guess. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you, Dan? Long time, no talk too? Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Pretty good. How are you doing? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're fine. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : So, Carol just stole some of my questions I was going to ask about the O&M, but earlier you mentioned the $100 million from shutting down Presque Isle and I guess, Pleasant Prairie I think. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Pulliam in Green Bay. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Oh, Pulliam, okay. So is that a gross savings or is that because you're going to have some additional costs from the new gas plant and et cetera? So is that the gross savings or the net savings or how should we... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, that would be simply just the O&M reduction from the closure of the plant. So in your terminology, would be gross savings. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And I think they're gross, but... Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Right, right, right. But that's not the bottom line impact you'll see from those closures because they're like for example in Michigan, you'll have the new plant operating costs, which would be lower probably than the coal cost, but still... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yes, substantially lower. Substantially lower, yes. But you're correct. Your analysis is correct. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : And when is the timing for both of those again the close? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: The plan is to close Pulliam as soon as American Transmission Company completes the transmission upgrade in that area, which we're hoping will be in the fourth quarter of this year, but certainly by year end would be our plan. And then on Presque Isle, essentially the gating factor there is completion of the RICE units that we've talked about, these reciprocal internal combustion engines, and we would expect to be able to close Presque Isle by mid-to-late 2019. Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Do you want to go to Antelope County, Dan?

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectation at the time that they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed information financial is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Hot town, summer in the City. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us today as we review our 2018 second quarter results. But first, I know that all of you are interested in an update on Allen Leverett\u2019s recovery from the stroke that he suffered last October. Allen remains in very good physical condition, and he continues to be engaged in intensive speech therapy. He\u2019s really working hard. In fact, Allen has engaged in more than 700 hours of speech therapy in the past nine months and he has continued to make progress. Now many of you have asked about our succession planning in the event that Allen can\u2019t or chooses not to return as CEO. As I mentioned to you on our last call, we conduct rigorous succession planning discussions with our Board on a regular basis and we\u2019ve done so for many years. So I can assure you that we have a solid plan B in place if Allen does not assume his previous role. The plan would involve a number of internal promotions. We would have continuity going forward, and the Board and I are very comfortable with what I call plan B. We will continue to monitor the situation during the third quarter of this year and we\u2019ll certainly keep you up to date on any new developments. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.73 a share. This compares with $0.63 a share for the second quarter last year. Our results were bolstered by effective cost management, stronger natural gas sales during a cool spring, and a warm start to summer that drove electricity use above our forecast. In addition, a stronger economy across the region resulted in slightly higher demand for energy from our industrial customers. Scott will provide you with more details in just a few minutes. But I will say that one of the striking conclusions from our first-half results is the significant increase in weather normalized demand for natural gas, up 5.4% year-to-date. Now let\u2019s take a brief look at the economic conditions in our region. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate declined to 2.8% in May, a record low for the state. Unemployment ticked up slightly to 2.9% in June, but we have now recorded five consecutive months with the unemployment rate under 3%, and that folks has never happened before in Wisconsin history, and we continue to see positive economic development news across the state as well. On June 28, Foxconn Technology Group held a groundbreaking ceremony for its $10 billion high-tech manufacturing campus that will be located in Racine County, it\u2019s just South of Milwaukee. Excavation work is already well underway. The plan is to move 4 million cubic yards of soil. And to put that in perspective, the soil removed from the excavation site would wrap completely around the equator if you pile the soil approximately one foot wide by one foot high. Next month, construction also will begin on the first building of this 22 million square foot project. In addition, Foxconn has purchased an office building in downtown Milwaukee for its North American headquarters, and the company recently announced that it will expand its operations with innovation centers in Green Bay and Eau Claire, pretty cool stuff. And just this past week, the Wisconsin Commission approved the building of a new transmission line that will be needed to strengthen the network for a number of customers, including Foxconn in the Southeastern part of the state. American Transmission Company plans to invest approximately $117 million in the project. I might add that, we\u2019re also making some very promising investments. On June 28, we announced an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center, that\u2019s located in Henry County, Illinois. The wind farm was developed by Invenergy, it was just placed into service in May. Bishop Hill consists of 53 General Electric turbines with a capacity of 132 megawatts. Our 80% share of the investment will be approximately $148 million. The project has a 22-year off-take agreement with one of our current wholesale power customers, WPPI Energy. So this investment really is a logical extension of our core wholesale power business. WPPI based in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, has been a significant wholesale customer of ours for years. And we\u2019re pleased to extend that relationship with a new efficient renewable asset that exists within the MISO footprint. Under the new tax rules, our investment in Bishop Hill will qualify for production tax credits and for 100% bonus depreciation. We expect our return on this investment will be actually higher than our regulated returns. We\u2019re projecting an unlevered internal rate of return above 8%.We filed for approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission earlier this month and expect a close on the investment in October. As always, we\u2019ll keep you updated as developments unfold. And now for a brief update on our planned investment in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. Back in mid-June, you recall, we filed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval to purchase an 80% ownership interest in this project. As a reminder, the wind farm is located in Antelope County, Nebraska and consists of 81 GE wind turbines with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts. Our share of the total purchase price is expected to be $280 million. The project has a long-term 10-year off-take agreement with an affiliate of Allianz, which as you know, is an A-rated publicly traded company. We expect to close on the purchase in early 2019 after construction is complete. Now for those of you who follow the details of our capital investment plan, you\u2019ll recall that we\u2019re also proposing to add utility scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets. On May 31, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Southwestern Wisconsin in Iowa County and will be developed by Invenergy. The Two Creeks solar project will be located in the City of Two Rivers, that\u2019s in Northeastern Wisconsin near the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant. The Two Creeks project is being developed by NextEra Energy Resources. Our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary will own 100 megawatts at each site, with an investment of approximately $260 million. Pending regulatory approvals, construction for both projects is expected to begin next spring with commercial operation by the end of 2020. Over the past few years, as many of you have followed, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost-effective option for our customers an option that also fits well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. As we continue to make these renewable investments and retire older less-efficient coal-fire generation, we expect to achieve our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40% well in advance of our 2030 target. And today, I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re taking our efforts a step further. We set a new long-term goal for carbon dioxide emissions. Our goal is an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions below 2005 levels by the year 2050. You can learn more about our plans to achieve that goal in our Corporate Responsibility Report, and we\u2019ll be releasing that report tomorrow morning. Now an update on the outcome of tax reform in Wisconsin. In late May, we received a final written order from the Commission. For electric customers and We Energies, 80% of the tax benefit will be used to reduce the regulatory asset from transmission costs that we\u2019ve already incurred, but not yet build the customers. The remaining 20% will be refunded to customers in the form of bill credits. For electric customers of Wisconsin Public Service, 40% of the tax benefit will be used to offset several regulatory asset balances and 60% will be refunded in the form of bill credits. For our natural gas customers in Wisconsin, the full amount of the tax savings will flow to customers through bill credits. We believe these were thoughtful, balanced decisions by the commission, Wisconsin customers began seeing their bill credits this month. Now with these decisions, tax reform treatment in our largest jurisdictions has now been finalized, and all decisions across our four state area are in line with what we expected. Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make real progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization program. This program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. We\u2019re on track to invest approximately $290 million in the effort during 2018. The overall project is now approximately 25% complete. Now an update on our operations in Minnesota. In mid-October last year, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Interim rates are currently in place and hearings on the case were held in mid-July. We expect the final commission decisions by year end. I would add that we\u2019re also making excellent progress on our gas expansion project in the Rochester area, where the Mayo Clinic is growing rapidly. We\u2019ve completed the first phase of a multi-year plan to strengthen and expand our infrastructure for natural gas delivery, and the second phase installing a new high pressure system is on budget and well underway. Next, we\u2019ll turn to Michigan. As a reminder, we obtain final regulatory approval last October for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. Procurement is 67% complete and construction stands at 21% complete. Our plan is to bring the new units into commercial service by the second quarter of next year, that\u2019s 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. We\u2019re investing about $266 million in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them RICE units. They\u2019ll be capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for customers in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. And just one final note on the quarter. In May, Corporate Responsibility Magazine recognized us again for our environmental, social and governance practices, and named us one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States. Now with details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, another good corporate citizen, our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our 2018 second quarter earnings of $0.73 per share were $0.10 per share higher than the second quarter of 2017. These favorable results were largely driven by higher sales volumes and continued effective cost control. Cooler than normal spring temperatures led to higher natural gas sales and electric sales were helped by a warm start to summer. We estimate that sales driven by weather and strong economy contributed approximately $0.07 to the quarter compared to our expectations, with approximately $0.04 of that related to whether. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes comparison of second quarter and year-to-date results for 2018 and 2017. My focus will be on the quarter beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page nine of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $330.8 million, compared to $362.2 million during the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $31.4 million. Excluding two tax items totaling $66.5 million, operating income actually increased $35.1 million. The first tax item reflects the benefit of tax repairs, which is part of our Wisconsin rate settlement; and the second item relates to the 2017 federal tax legislation. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on Page 7 and 8 of the earnings package. Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we\u2019ve agreed to utilize the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. The plan is proceeding as expected. And then regarding the benefits of tax reform, we currently project that the transmission escrow balance at Wisconsin Electric will be reduced from approximately $220 million to $40 million or less by the end of 2019. Excluding the impact of these tax items, operating income increased $35.1 million. By segment update, we\u2019ll focus on this $35.1 million in operating income as shown on Page 9 of the packet. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the increase in operating income, net of the tax-related adjustments was $22.6 million. Higher sales volumes rolled $26.4 million increase in margins. In Illinois, operating income increased $1 million net of tax adjustments. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the Peoples Gas System Modernization program. The remaining increase in operating income in our Other States segment was about $4 million, largely driven by cooler than normal spring weather conditions. Turning to our Non-Utility Infrastructure segment. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at this segment increased by $6.3 million. Remember that this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30th of last year, as well as We Power. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.7 million to the increase in operating income in the second quarter of 2018. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment was $6.5 million for the second quarter of 2018, an improvement of $1.2 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Combining these changes and excluding the two tax items, as I discussed, operating income increased $35.1 million. Earnings from our investment in American transmission company totaled $28.7 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, as compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $9.4 million impact from tax reform, our equity earnings decreased $3.7 million, driven by a charge recorded at ATC related to the final resolution of a FERC audit. Other income net increased by $18.3 million quarter-over-quarter. This was due primarily to a decrease in the non-service cost component of our pension and benefit plans. Historically, this item was reflected in operation and maintenance and expense. However, a new accounting rule required it to be reclassified to other income in both years. Our net interest expense increased $6.6 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily by a continuing capital investment and higher interest rates. Our consolidated income tax decreased $64.7 million. As previously discussed, lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow through of tax repairs. We now expect our effective income tax rate will be between 15% and 16% this year. Excluding the benefits related to tax repairs, we expect the effective tax rate would be between 22% and 23%. Now as you may recall, that we\u2019ve been expecting to become a cash tax payer this year. However, based on our latest forecasts, we don\u2019t expect to pay cash taxes until the end of 2019. This change is largely driven by the benefits of bonus depreciation from our investment in Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind projects. Combining all these items brings us to earnings of $231 million, or $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2018, compared to earnings of $199.1 million, or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017. Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $246.5 million during the first six months of 2018. Recall that we made $100 million contribution to our pension plan in the first-half of 2017. Higher earnings and a reduction in working capital also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures totaled $915.5 million during the first-half of 2018, a $125.5 million increase compared to the same period in 2017, as we continue to execute on our capital plan. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from the 52.5% at the end of 2017. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401k plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We continue to expect the FFO to debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We paid $348.7 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2018, an increase of $20.4 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 6.25% increase in the dividend level compared to the first-half of 2017. Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 10,000 more electric and 15,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity for Wisconsin and Michigan utilities, excluding the iron ore mine, are up 2.9% for the quarter and on a weather normalized basis, retail deliveries were up 1.7%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 18.2% versus the second quarter of 2017. This excludes gas used for power generation. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew 6.6% on a weather normalized basis. Weather normalized electric and gas sales volumes were above our expectations for the first-half of 2018. Finally, an update on our earnings guidance. Due to our favorable year-to-date results, we\u2019re raising full-year earnings guidance to $3.32 per share, assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year, and we\u2019re reaffirming our long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. As you recall, our long-term growth rate is based of the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.09 a share. We expect our third quarter 2018 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70, that takes into account July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. We\u2019re still standing and we\u2019re focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we\u2019re ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the conference call. Operator : Now we will take your question. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Gale Klappa : Hey, Greg, how are you? Greg Gordon : I\u2019m good, Gale. Cancel your Christmas plans, because it\u2019s Packers Jets 1 o\u2019clock on December 23rd in Middle Hansen [ph]. Gale Klappa : I\u2019ll be there. Greg Gordon : A couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about the success you\u2019ve had in executing these infrastructure investments outside the core utility? It strikes me that these returns look very good and that may be in part to a competitive advantage you have, because you\u2019re one of the few utility holding companies left with tax appetite, the table to actually transact on wind farms and consume those attributes, but then you also just articulated a slight move out and when you\u2019re a cash taxpayer, so can you just frame up why this is a good opportunity for you and you\u2019ve scoped it as sort of 8% of your total capital over the current five-year plan. Is there a chance that, that grows? Is that about where you think you\u2019re going to end up? That\u2019s my first question. Gale Klappa : Yes, good question, Greg. I appreciate, you\u2019re asking. I mean, first of all, you may recall when we rolled out our new five-year capital plan late last fall, right before EEI Conference, we introduced this energy infrastructure category and we put about $900 million into that category out of an $11.8 billion total capital budget. So, yes, it\u2019s roughly 8%, 9% of our total capital spending. Since then and given some of the impacts of tax reform given the fact that other companies in the industry are finding themselves in a position to sell assets, I think we do have a competitive advantage. I mean, first of all, our balance sheet is strong. We don\u2019t have to issue equity to finance this $11.8 billion capital plan, and we do have the tax appetite. So when you look at the whole array of opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, actually Greg, the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing two of which we\u2019ve obviously just announced in the last couple of months, the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing to basically acquire high-quality assets that don\u2019t change our risk profile, those opportunities are greater than we thought they would be back last fall. Again, it\u2019s a small percentage of our total capital budget when we roll out the new five-year plan this fall, I \u2013 if I were a betting man, I would think we would increase that the amount devoted to that particular segment a bit, but again keeping all this in perspective, we\u2019re being opportunistic with good high-quality assets here, but the driver, I mean, this is a great opportunistic situation for us, but the driver is still core investment in our regulated businesses. I hope that helps, Greg. Greg Gordon : Yes, it definitely does. Thanks. And my second question is just with regard to the evolution of the Foxconn, the Foxconn project, you guys in your last sort of formal update said, you thought that would be a $10 billion project and create 13,000 direct jobs and about 22,000 indirect jobs throughout the state. But when I talked to analysts who focus 100% of their time on the semiconductor industry, like there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a debate there as to what type of facility actually gets built, whether it\u2019s a facility that is a gen 6 fab or a gen 10 fab. And this corning going to co-locate our gas facility in the state or not, because that would be the gating factor towards the larger 10.5 facility. So can you give us a sense of whether you\u2019re still confident that those round numbers reflect the commitment to dollars invested in jobs or whether there\u2019s some sort of a bid/ask spread in terms of what they ultimately build in terms of what types of products they\u2019re building, whether it\u2019s smartphones or TVs and whether that means it\u2019s less jobs, more jobs, et cetera? Gale Klappa : Yes, good, great questions, Greg. Let me answer it two ways. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve been very involved in this project personally, and within the last two weeks in a meeting with the Foxconn senior people, they strongly reiterated their commitment to a $10 billion investment and the hiring of 13,000 jobs. They also, when President Trump came for the groundbreaking ceremony on June 28, they made a public commitment to a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs with the President standing right there. So what they\u2019re saying is that, the mix of products that they\u2019re thinking of producing here changes as their assessment of the marketplace changes. So they may build something here different than their original projections at least that\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. But in terms of their ultimate commitment of a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs, that remains staunchly unchanged and remains firmly in place. And when you see the hundreds of millions of dollars that are already being spent and the gigantic amount of earth that\u2019s already being moved, I think, it brings all that to reality, right? Greg Gordon : Great. That\u2019s very clear Thanks, Gale. Have a great day. Gale Klappa : You too. Take care, Greg. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Julien. How are you today? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good. Thank you very much. So perhaps just to turn to the more regulatory side of things, can you discuss a little bit how the legislative mechanism passed in terms of settlements kind of changes your process in terms of the next rate case? I mean that both in terms of going into the next rate case filing itself, as well as just subsequently through it, just want to understand that legislation and what it means exactly a little bit more clearly? Gale Klappa : I appreciate the question. And I think I would answer that in two ways for you Julien. First of all, it really does not change our fundamental approach to a rate filing or to discussions about a rate settlement. What I think the legislation does do is makes it easier and clearer for the Commission to accept a non-unanimous settlement, and that\u2019s the real key here in that legislation. There was some debate when we went through the last rate settlement, as you recall, which we\u2019re now in a rate freeze going on four years. There was some debate about whether or not the Public Service Commission had the statutory authority to vote on and approve a settlement that was not completely unanimous among all the parties. This legislation that was passed makes it clear that they can vote on and can decide on a settlement that is not joined by every single party. So I think that\u2019s the big difference that the legislation has enabled. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. And turning back to a couple little of nuancy things. First, with what you\u2019ve mentioned to Greg here. The wind investment, just can you elaborate a little bit more as to why they\u2019re better? And also I suppose implicitly you continue to have appetite, given that you still have 20 onwards tax appetite? Gale Klappa : And actually late 2019 onwards, yes. What Julien \u2013 why they\u2019re better than what? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well, the unlevered 8%, that sounds better than what you would get on a kind of traditional utility basis so\u2026 Gale Klappa : Oh, yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Gale Klappa : No question. We\u2019re seeing in both these investments that we\u2019ve announced. We\u2019re projecting, given the contracts and the details of the contracts. We\u2019re projecting a better IRR\u2019s than you would see in a normal regulated investment. And also, because both of these wind projects are eligible for 100% bonus depreciation, the cash return is very significant. So I think, again, given the overall conditions in the industry with a number of companies trying to repair their balance sheets, where we can be opportunistic because of the strength of our balance sheet in our tax appetite, we\u2019re seeing very solid projects that don\u2019t change our risk profile. And so we intend to continue to look very carefully at projects in front of us and be opportunistic with something that we think will benefit our shareholders with a portion of our capital spending. Scott, anything to add? Scott Lauber : No, you hit right on the head, Gale. The tax appetite really does help bring that projects getting that cash back from bonus depreciation early on. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And to that point actually, just to clarify this, I mean, the solar RTC, the commenced construction safe harbor, I mean, is that still too early to ask you about implications, given the tax appetite you all have and obviously your interest at least on the utility side for solar? Gale Klappa : Well, it probably, if you think about the non-utility side, it probably gives us a little longer runway to look at projects. On the utility side, what we propose and what we will propose actually fits under the prior timeframe for the tax credits. So I don\u2019t think it would change anything on the utility side necessarily. I think, it gives us a little bit longer runway on the non-utility side if we make some solar investments on that \u2013 in that part of the business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Gale Klappa : Michael, when do we get our gig on Fox Sports? Michael Weinstein : I\u2019m ready to go. I\u2019m ready to move out there. Let me know when you\u2019re ready. Gale Klappa : All right. Michael Weinstein : Can you just talk about how much of the increase in guidance is due to weather and or one-time in nature? Gale Klappa : I think, Scott gave you a nice quick breakdown of that in his prepared remarks. Michael Weinstein : Yes. Scott Lauber : Well, when you look at the weather for the quarter, I mean, the weather was about $0.04 and the rest is \u2013 was growth. So we raised the top end of the guidance, $0.02, really reflecting a combination of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and along with the weather. But we didn\u2019t raise it anymore than the $0.02, because we do have some projects \u2013 some maintenance projects that we\u2019re looking at for the fall this year, including some forestry and maintenance that was above and beyond last year, expenses and also a little headwind on fuel coming up. Michael Weinstein : So that is why the guidance is still based on 2017, it\u2019s not really in the long-term guidance, right? It\u2019s not 2018 number, yes? Scott Lauber : Yes, the long-term guidance. Gale Klappa : And, Michael, I think, you can look forward, I mean, historically in the fall when we when we\u2019ve unveiled the new five-year capital spending plan. We also give you some sense of what our updating and rebasing our long-term earnings growth rate. And so I think, you\u2019ll see us do that on the next quarter\u2019s call as well. Michael Weinstein : Great. And also the increase, the new goal of 80% by 2050, when can we expect to see that start to be reflected in forward capital plans? Gale Klappa : Well, we already have \u2013 a very good question. We already have the capital plan in place that gets us probably by about 2023 to the 40% reduction. Remember, our first target was a 40% reduction below 2005 levels by the year 2030. The capital plan that we\u2019re executing now actually gets us there in terms of that 40% reduction by about 2023. So then heading toward a 2050 goal of 80% reduction, I think, you can start \u2013 we can start seeing some of that capital being injected into our plan 2024 and beyond. Michael Weinstein : Okay, great. Thank you. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Gale Klappa : Hi, Steve, how are you? Steven Fleishman : Good, Gale. How are you doing? Gale Klappa : Doing fine. Steven Fleishman : I was curious your thoughts one of your neighboring utilities just worked out a deal, the Alliant deal doing an RO with NextEra with the nuclear. And you obviously have maybe somewhat similar situation with different circumstances. So could you maybe give or take on whether something like might make sense for you guys at Point Beach? Gale Klappa : Sure, we\u2019re happy to. First of all, I think, you\u2019re right. The circumstances are a bit different between the two utilities. If you think about our power supply coming from Point Beach and right now we have a contract in place for all of the output of the two Point Beach units for the remainder of their lives, which looks like 2030 and 2033 for the two units. So the first unit would retire in 2030, the second at the end of 2033. Those Point Beach units are producing about 22% of our total power supply for our retail customers. That\u2019s a very significant portion of our \u2013 of the energy we\u2019re delivering and, of course, it\u2019s carbon-free and it\u2019s dispatchable and basically runs, as you know, is a base load unit 24/7. So it runs and dispatches carbon-free energy regardless of whether the sun is shining or whether the wind is blowing. So it\u2019s a very important component today of our power supply and of our ongoing efforts to reduce carbon emissions. So you never say never in terms of doing a buyout like what our \u2013 one of our other utility friends has done. But at the moment, I don\u2019t see that in our future, in part, because it\u2019s a little bit different situation in terms of the magnitude of the power supply we\u2019re getting from Point Beach. I hope that respond Steve. Steven Fleishman : Yes. That\u2019s great. And just want to go back to the prior question. So on your next quarter call, you plan to refresh the long-term capital plan and the long-term growth rate? Gale Klappa : Yep, because I\u2019ll be right before the meeting, where we can dive into great detail with you and yes, that\u2019s our plan. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Okay, thank you. Gale Klappa : All tight. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful Mehta : Hi, guys. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon. Hi, Praful, how are you? Praful Mehta : Good. So I think you made a point on the call to talk about load growth or sales growth, especially on the gas side. So wanted to get a little bit more perspective on what\u2019s driving that? And secondly, does that \u2013 is that a sustainable kind of growth level that would give you more headroom to kind of increase CapEx? How should we think about that? Gale Klappa : Well, it\u2019s a great question. And it has been one of the positive upside surprises for us. Really, over the last three years, if you look at and we try to weather normalize, but you\u2019ve heard me say before, there are real deficiencies in how our industry weather normalizes sales. So I\u2019m always reluctant to talk about one quarter of weather normalized data. But we now have 2.5 years of weather normalized data, which is showing real continued growth in gas deliveries and customer use of natural gas. I think, Scott, we were up like three 3.7% and then another 3.7%, so you talk about 2016 and 2017 being about 3.7% increases on a weather nornmal basis. And then as you\u2019ve heard Scott and me say, we had a robust growth in weather normalized demand in the first-half of this year. So, it\u2019s very hard to tell whether or not that trend will continue, but clearly the trend has exceeded our expectations. And when you look at \u2013 and Scott and I really delve into this in great detail the other day. When you look at \u2013 to try to answer the question, what is driving this demand for natural gas beyond our expectations. And it\u2019s not just one sector, it\u2019s like every sector we looked at was green. Every sector we looked at was showing significant increases. So that combined with customer growth, we\u2019re serving about 15,000 natural gas customers more than what we were serving at this time a year ago. So I don\u2019t want to be overly optimistic here. But what we\u2019ve seen for the last basically, 10 quarters, certainly would indicate that there\u2019s some other trend going on here, which we haven\u2019t seen before, driving natural gas usage higher. Now what that means for capital spending? Obviously, we will take a hard look as we always do as we roll out our new five-year plan, and you may see some modest increase in capital spending on the gas side simply because of the infrastructure needs. And, for example, we\u2019ve already applied to the Wisconsin Commission for two projects, that would strengthen the natural gas delivery network in the Racine area, where Foxconn is and many others are now beginning project work. We simply don\u2019t have a strong enough natural gas delivery network to handle all that demand in that part of the state. So there\u2019s another $140 million of capital already that was not in our previous forecast. I hope that\u2019s a long answer to your question. I hope it helps. Praful Mehta : It\u2019s very helpful and a very interesting trend. So we\u2019d love to learn more on future calls as well. And for a second question, I just wanted to understand a little bit more on the taxes side. As you become a cash tax payer in that 2019 to 2020 timeframe, just wanted to understand what is the impact of the FFO? Like how much is the year-over-year impacted that point that you expect? And the reason for the question is, I\u2019m just trying to figure out the FFO to debt kind of trajectory impact of that change and how are you filling that gap? I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s something else that\u2019s helping to fill that FFO gap, so just a little bit of color on that would be helpful? Scott Lauber : That\u2019s a good question. When you look in our assumptions are that we are partial taxpayers in 2019 and going forward, factoring all in the production tax credit. So we\u2019re still at that 16 FFO to debt or a little bit north of that. So if we find other projects to have additional tax savings that would just increase us or put us higher in the FFO range. Gale Klappa : That \u2013 that\u2019s the net effect of additional projects. Scott Lauber : Yes. Gale Klappa : It raises basically from, say, 16, it raises a bit higher, which is a good thing. Scott Lauber : If we can get some additional tax bonus depreciation projects? Gale Klappa : Right. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. And that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Space. Gale Klappa : Hey, Shah, somebody told me a rumor that based on one of your mentors, you were starting to take Thursdays off now. Is that true? Shahriar Pourreza : I will not admit this on a public line. So thanks for taking my question. Just one quick round Foxconn and sort of the, obviously, the groundbreaking. The last discussions we had was, obviously, the potential for rooftop solar in the 100 to 150 megawatt range, and I think there was some discussions around whether it would be technically feasible and whether it would pass building codes. Is there any sort of updates that you\u2019ve had around with discussions around this potential? Gale Klappa : Shan, what I can tell you and you\u2019ve got a great memory. What I can tell you is, we are still in active discussions with Foxconn about the configuration of their electric service \u2013 the basic elements of their rates and whether or not if there\u2019s any opportunity for solar. So continuing discussions, nothing new yet to report the continuing active discussions. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And that depending on how the active discussions go, that\u2019s something that \u2013 would that be bid to an RFP process, or would that be something that would naturally come to you guys? Gale Klappa : Well, I guess, there are two options. One would be a self billed by Foxconn, the other would be that we would basically make the investment. And again, too early to really give you a concrete answer at this point except other than everything\u2019s on the table and we\u2019re looking to how this best works for both parties. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on, is there any updates on incremental storage opportunities at the utilities? Gale Klappa : Incremental gas storage opportunities? Shahriar Pourreza : That\u2019s right, yes. Gale Klappa : No, other than that energy infrastructure category that we\u2019ve developed, I mean, one of the range of options we look at for that category for potential investment is gas storage. But nothing new to report on that front today. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, terrific. Thanks. I want to go take the rest the day off. I appreciate. See you guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Good afternoon, guys. Gale Klappa : Okay. Tell me Jonathan, you never take the day off. Jonathan Arnold : Oh, well, no, maybe not the first day. So on the \u2013 just a couple of numbers questions that we wanted to chase down the other income line where you talked about the lower non-service overhead cost and it\u2019s affecting both years. It didn\u2019t seem like the 2017 number line changed this quarter whereas it did last quarter. So just trying to get a sense of how big was that driver and what else was going on in the $18 million there? Scott Lauber : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that goes to the other income and deduction lying here. And unfortunately, some of these items are being reclass between O&M and this other line, so I guess, really confusing in. And when we manage the business, we really look at both of them together. So last quarter what also goes through here is a couple of items that swing between quarters like we have an investment in some deferred funds out there like it\u2019s a rabbi trust for some deferred comp and that also fluctuates between quarters. But year-to-date, this is \u2013 the reclass of this non-service cost for the pension was the biggest number about $10 million on a year-to-date basis. So there\u2019s a variety of items that go both ways, including some miscellaneous interest income and the deferral related to our forward wind farm. When we put that into the rates in Wisconsin, we were allowed to defer a few of those costs to offset and unfortunately, that goes in this line also. So there\u2019s a mixture of stuff in there, but this was the biggest item for the quarter and for the year-to-date that really came out. Jonathan Arnold : That pension drive you just said about $10 million year-to-date. Was that actually a change, or was it just the reclass? Scott Lauber : It\u2019s \u2013 it was a reclass out of O&M down here. The benefits last year, a couple of items of why the pension is down. The fund did well last year. The assets grew. So their earnings are better this year. The interest expense is down a little bit. And we did combine some plans into the Medicare Plan A for some other post-employment retirements plans, so there was some savings there also. Gale Klappa : Jonathan, what you\u2019re seeing in that category is a lot of accounting noise and we don\u2019t probably see that \u2013 you\u2019re going to see that every quarter. There\u2019s just so many items that swing around. And then as Scott said, the new accounting rule required us to reclassify as well. So we try to spitball that for you as best we can. So that you can see what\u2019s going on. But it also masks \u2013 all of these things also masks how we\u2019re doing on, what I call, true operation and maintenance costs, and we\u2019re still on target there. We said we would expect about a 3% to 4% decline in 2018 over 2017 true O&M and we\u2019re right on target to achieve that. Jonathan Arnold : Right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then so just one other thing. You mentioned this, you have some ordered resolution at ATC. Was that a materialized? I mean, is it just this quarter or was this follow-on there? Scott Lauber : It\u2019s just a very small item for the quarter here. We just \u2013 when you back out the tax reform stuff that was negative, I mean, you don\u2019t anticipate to be a negative. So it\u2019s about $3 million for the quarter. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you for that. Sorry for the detail. Scott Lauber : No problem. Gale Klappa : No, not at all. Good questions, Jonathan. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : Good afternoon. Gale Klappa : Hello, how are you? Paul Ridzon : Can you hear me? Gale Klappa : I\u2019m fine, Paul. How are you? Paul Ridzon : Okay. Good. Just that last question. Is that \u2013 what period was that audit related to? Gale Klappa : Well, it goes all the way back to 2004, I think, it was a long period of time. It was before the Internet. No I\u2019m kidding. So it was really, I think, 2004 up through like 2015 or 2016. Paul Ridzon : And that was $2.7 million you said? Scott Lauber : It was $3 million hit for the quarter. Paul Ridzon : Okay. And then you said when you give us a new CapEx deck, we could see more non-utility infrastructure. Do you think that higher level would be incremental to your utility plan, or are you going to pull some utility back and add the higher return non-utility? Gale Klappa : No, I think \u2013 but very good question. But what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the needed investment in our utility core infrastructure, I don\u2019t see us pulling that back, because those projects are needed. So no, I wouldn\u2019t see it diminish and if you will. Paul Ridzon : Right. Scott Lauber : We are not going to take capital spending plan away from the core utilities to move it into this particular category. So if anything there might be a bit of an upside, because I think what we\u2019re seeing here again in terms of our utility core investments, those are needed projects for reliability. So that would stay steady as she goes. So you might see it, but I think you might see a bit of an uptick if the conditions we\u2019re seeing persist in the other category. And again, to keep all this in perspective, today, it\u2019s like 8% to 9% of an $11.8 billion capital plan. But I think, it again reflects the strength of the company that we can take opportunistic advantage of these kinds of good assets. Paul Ridzon : How much more can you grow the CapEx without issuing equity? Scott Lauber : Well, we\u2019ll take a look at it, but \u2013 and again, our plan is not to issue equity. But as your earnings grow and as you get bonus depreciation from some of these projects, it gives you some room. Paul Ridzon : Yes. Scott Lauber : And we track all the metrics that you talked about before FFO to debt and the holding company debt to total get around that 30%, so those are metrics that we\u2019re looking at. Paul Ridzon : Just \u2013 I think you answered this one already, just want to make sure. Did you say you\u2019re going to rebase the 5% to 7% growth or reconsider the 5% to 7% growth? Gale Klappa : No, rebase. I mean, right now our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate is based off, as Scott said, the midpoint of our 2017 original guidance. So as we move forward to another year on capital spending, we\u2019ll rebase our long-term growth rate off a newer number. Paul Ridzon : But it\u2019s a 5% to 7% up for reconsideration? Gale Klappa : Based on everything we\u2019re seeing, no, I think 5% to 7% will stay intact. Paul Ridzon : Thank you for that clarification. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. Good questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint. Andrew Levi : Hey, Gale, how are you doing? Gale Klappa : I\u2019m good, Andy. Are you Exodus or Xodus? Andrew Levi : Exodus. I got to this from millennium, you know. Gale Klappa : Yes. Oh, impressive, yes. Andrew Levi : So as I listen, I mean, and obviously as I\u2019ve seen through last two quarters come in the raising CapEx, obviously, what you\u2019re saying about refreshing everything at EEIs. And also most importantly, in some ways looking at the top line growth and hopefully will continue into the third quarter. It sounds like at the very least when you rebase and I assume, I don\u2019t want to kind of preview that. But you\u2019re kind of be towards the high-end of your growth rate going forward, 6% to 7%. Is that the hope based on, especially if you do get that top line growth? Gale Klappa : Andy, stay tuned and we\u2019ll be happy to discuss in detail on the next call. Andrew Levi : Okay, I tried. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Yes, you did a nice try, Andy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of [indiscernible]. Gale Klappa : Jon, [ph] how are you? Unidentified Analyst : Pretty good and congratulations. Great results. I wanted to know, again, is there some way that one can translate like the sales growth in the gas businesses, I would say, a tremendous? Is this some way to quantify that, say, 2% growth in sales in gas equates to this much in earnings growth? Is there some kind of rule of thumb that one can apply to convert the sales growth into earnings growth? Gale Klappa : Yes. Generally, we can do that. But I would caution you and Scott can \u2013 I\u2019ll let Scott give you his rule of thumb. But I would caution you that we are somewhat earnings capped, because we have sharing mechanisms in place for all three of our Wisconsin utilities, including Wisconsin Gas. Wisconsin Electric has a gas component and Wisconsin Public Service has a gas component. So, all things being equal, we can give you a rule of thumb, but anything above our allowed rates of return, we properly share with customers. So I would just throw in a word of caution in terms of just blindly using the rule of thumb, because again, we\u2019re in a promised area that, I think, is very healthy for everyone, where earnings above our allowed return of shares. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly correct, Gale. And when you look at sales \u2013 if you look at sales across all the sectors and you have about a 1% sales growth in residential, small commercial and transportation in Wisconsin, that equals to about 0.75% or $3 million pre-tax. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Scott Lauber : So it\u2019s about $3 million pre-tax for 1% growth in all the sectors. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And so just on the point that you mentioned, Gale, sort of I\u2019m assuming this year, you would be based on this really strong start to the year, you would be setting mechanisms in all those territories. Is that a fair assumption? Gale Klappa : Assuming normal weather and normal expenses that we\u2019re projecting going forward for the remainder of the year, yes, I would expect we would be in sharing in all three of the companies. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re more than welcome. Great questions. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Vedula Murti : Good afternoon, guys. Gale Klappa : [indiscernible], Vedula How are you? Vedula Murti : I\u2019m well. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : Good. Vedula Murti : A couple of things. One, going back to natural gas question. I mean, over a period of time and I don\u2019t \u2013 and I think this is true in Illinois, but I wasn\u2019t sure about Wisconsin about how trends have moved towards wanting to keep moving increasing to a larger fixed charge, less variable charge and moving increasingly to a decoupled model. And I\u2019m wondering right now if you can remind me how decoupled or undecoupled you are in Wisconsin, which is helping, I guess, the uplift here and whether, in fact, going forward as you go through various rate cases, whether you want to \u2013 whatever exposure you currently have, you would like to maintain, or whether you want to take this opportunity, in fact, to move even further into a decoupled scenario, given at least what we\u2019ve historically seen as long-term natural gas trends? Gale Klappa : Vedula, let me kind of tackle that in two elements. First of all, we\u2019ll talk about our largest gas delivery jurisdictions, Illinois and Wisconsin. In Illinois, there has been a decoupling plan in place for many, many years and it works quite well. But Illinois is basically decoupled and I expect it will stay that way for decades to come. In Wisconsin, we are not decoupled. And I really don\u2019t sense in terms of the regulatory backdrop here, any big appetite to move toward decoupling at all. And frankly, I think, the coupling can be a mixed bag. First of all, getting the details of coupling right is a big deal. They\u2019ve done a good job of that in Illinois. Here, I think, the growth we\u2019re seeing and the growth we continue to expect to see, that growth really aligns the company and its business plan with economic growth. So for Wisconsin, I think, we\u2019re going to continue to see the same type of regulatory environment and backdrop of the same type of regulatory treatment. I don\u2019t see us moving to decoupling certainly not in the next rate case. Vedula Murti : Okay. And to follow-up on Jonathan Arnold\u2019s question about all those cumulative accounting noise issues and pension or OPEB, et cetera, if I looked at the release and everything correctly, I think, it was about $0.06, I think, at least, for this quarter if I\u2019m \u2013 if that\u2019s correct, that was a positive benefit. And I\u2019m just wondering how we then think about that as we roll forward in terms of either normalization or sustainable, whatever it is? Gale Klappa : Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. When you look at that and when we really factored all that is \u2013 all that in, we were really looking at that as part of our O&M expenses and really consolidating it altogether. So the offset, when you do the math, it looks like O&M expenses is not down as far as you think and that\u2019s because some of these reclasses. So I really look at them together and I think together you have a good picture of where we are, we give the guidance and being down about 3% to 4%. Gale Klappa : Yes, I think, Scott is right. We kind of have to piece through the details of these two pictures, put it all back together and we\u2019re still on track for about the 3% to 4% decline that we had projected in O&M expenses compared to last year. Vedula Murti : And two other last things. One, in Illinois, if I\u2019m not mistaken, there\u2019s a ROE adjustment mechanism based on levels of interest rates. And can you just remind me how that works? Where you guys stand? And when it gets \u2013 how that gets refreshed if we go into a higher interest rate environment in the future? And then I have one last question. Gale Klappa : Vedula, I\u2019ll suggest you save that question for Exelon, because in Illinois that, that rate adjustment tied to, I think, 10-year treasury rates applies only at this point in time to electric, not to natural gas. Vedula Murti : Okay, that\u2019s good to know. And secondarily, in terms of the utility CapEx, the current plan for $11.8 billion, I think, you indicated that through the period there is no net external equity in that drip and everything like that is basically able to be funded internally. If we roll forward at kind of what level of CapeX does that then start needing to, at least, on the margin need to have some marginal incremental equity for rolling at a $11.8 billion over the current five years? I mean kind of where is it like the line where you start thinking you may need something, this is like 13, I\u2019m just making up a number, but I\u2019m just \u2013 want to kind of get a sense for that? Gale Klappa : Well, we\u2019ll have a lot more detail for you on the next call as we refresh the capital plan. Remember though, some of the investments we\u2019re making now push out the timeframe in which we become a tax \u2013 a cash taxpayer. And some of these investments also give us 100% bonus depreciation. So you really need to put all of the elements in there, and pretty soon it\u2019s Ragu and it\u2019s all in there. But I can tell you this. I think, we have some room because of the investments we\u2019re making for some increase in the capital plan over five years with no equity issuances in our plan is no equity issuances, no drip. We don\u2019t need it. The amount of outstanding shares we have today are going to be the outstanding shares we have tomorrow. Vedula Murti : Thank you very much. And give my best to Allen, the next time [Multiple Speakers] Gale Klappa : Sure. Well, thank you, Vedula. You take care. Gale Klappa : Well, folks, that concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate you participating. If you have any other questions, feel free to call at Beth Straka, and her direct line is 414-221-4639. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye.",

Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our 2018 third quarter results. But first, a quick personnel update. As we announced earlier this month, Allen Leverett, who has been on medical leave since suffering a stroke last October, has resigned from active duty with the company. Allen will continue to serve on our Board of Directors, and I'm delighted that Allen will continue to bring his insight and his experience to our deliberations. In light of Allen's decision to resign, our board has elected Kevin Fletcher as the new President of WEC Energy Group. Kevin has more than 40 years of experience in the energy industry, most recently as President of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service, our largest subsidiaries. His main focus will be on the operating and financial performance of our seven customer-facing utilities and he will report directly to me. I have had the privilege of knowing and working with Kevin for the past 25 years. With his experience in engineering, operations, customer service, and economic development, and of course, a strong focus on financial discipline, Kevin will provide great continuity for our organization going forward. For those of you who haven't met Kevin, he will be on hand with us at the EEI meetings in San Francisco and we're both looking forward to seeing you there. And now I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have : Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.74 a share. This compared to $0.68 a share for the third quarter last year. Our strong performance was principally driven by three factors : first, higher demand for electricity and natural gas, reflecting a robust economy across the region; warmer-than-normal summer temperatures; and our continued focus on efficiency and cost control throughout our operations. Scott will provide you with more details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a brief look at the economic conditions right here in the heartland. Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been at 3% or lower for the past eight months; that's the longest stretch of near-full employment in state history. The state has also witnessed significant growth in the manufacturing sector in the past year and I believe there are even greater opportunities ahead. For example, in late September, Komatsu Mining announced plans for a new development here in Milwaukee. Komatsu, as many of you know, a global leader in heavy construction and mining equipment, has agreed to develop 43 acres for a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and a new corporate office. Komatsu will invest $300 million in the project, which will have a defining impact on Milwaukee's Harbor District. Site is expected to be eventually housing more than 1,000 workers. And looking just south of Milwaukee, four months have now passed since Foxconn's official groundbreaking for the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park. In that time, a tremendous amount of progress has been made on this $10 billion high-tech manufacturing campus. Every day now brings an average of 400 workers to the site, about 3.5 million cubic yards of soil have been excavated and work has begun on the first building. The wall panels for that building were designed and assembled right here in Wisconsin. And to-date, more than 90% of all the contracts for the Foxconn development have been awarded to Wisconsin-based companies. As some of you may know, Foxconn is also planning to expand its reach in Wisconsin with innovation centers in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Eau Claire and Racine. We're just beginning folks to see the tremendous catalytic effect of Foxconn's investment plans for the region. And next, I'd like to touch on our WEC Energy growth plan and the investment opportunities we see unfolding over the next several years. You may recall that our capital budget, which includes our share of American Transmission's capital spending, was $13.4 billion for the five-year period 2018 through 2022. Today, we're announcing an updated five-year capital forecast for the years 2019 through 2023. Our new capital investment plan stands at $14.1 billion, an increase of $700 million over the previous five-year plan. We look forward to sharing all the details of our $14.1 billion plan with you at the upcoming EEI conference. You may have seen though from our earnings packet that we released this morning, we have growing opportunities in our natural gas delivery and energy infrastructure segments. Overall, I would say that our investment plan is exactly what you would expect it to be : solid low-risk projects, highly executable with no big bets. Today, we're also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. And we are updating the base for that growth rate. The new base is $3.28 a share. That's the midpoint of our original guidance for 2018. So, folks when you put all the pieces together, our new capital plan should support an earnings per share growth rate in the low 6% range. Switching gears now to our current capital projects. We're making real progress across-the-board on our electric and gas network upgrades, our generation projects and on our non-utility infrastructure segment. As you'll recall in late June, we announced an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. That's located in Henry County, Illinois. We received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on August 29. And two days later, we closed on the acquisition. Then in early October, we took advantage of an opportunity to increase our equity interest by an additional 10%. Pending FERC approval, we will have a 90% ownership interest in this wind farm. As a reminder, this wind facility was developed by Invenergy and was placed into service this past May. It consists of 53 General Electric turbines with a capacity of 132 megawatts. In total, our investment is expected to be $166 million. The project has a long-term 22-year offtake agreement with one of our current wholesale customers, WPPI Energy, so this investment is really a logical extension of our core wholesale power business. And now for a brief update on our planned investment in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. On June 15, we filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval to purchase an 80% ownership interest in the Upstream project. This wind farm is located in Antelope County, Nebraska. It consists of 81 GE wind turbines with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts. Our purchase price is expected to be $280 million. And again, that purchase price, the $280 million, is reflected in our infrastructure segment in our new five-year plan. The project has a long-term 10-year offtake agreement with an affiliate of Allianz, which is an A-rated publicly traded company. We expect to close on the purchase in early 2019 after construction is complete. Under the new tax rules, our original investments in these two wind farms qualify for production tax credits and 100% bonus depreciation. We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns. Specifically, we're projecting an unlevered internal rate of return above 8% or in the mid-teens on a levered basis. And we're projecting returns on equity based on a 50 :50 capital structure at or above our retail returns. We're also making progress on our quest to add utility-scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets. To refresh your memory, on May 31, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in southwestern Wisconsin, in Iowa County. It will be developed by Invenergy. The Two Creeks project will be located in the city of Two Rivers in Northeastern Wisconsin near the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant. The Two Creeks project is being developed by NextEra. Our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary will own 100 megawatts at each site, with an investment of approximately $260 million. Pending regulatory approvals, we expect construction for both projects to begin next spring, with commercial operation by the end of 2020. Over the past few years, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost-effective option for our customers, an option that also fits well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Our investments in zero-carbon generation will support our aggressive long-term goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by the year 2050. Turning now to Illinois, as I've said before, the Peoples Gas system modernization program is critical, providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe, and reliable. We're on track to invest approximately $270 million in the effort this year. The overall project is now approximately 26% complete. And now a word about our Minnesota utility, in October of last year, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Public Utilities Commission. Interim rates are currently in place, and hearings in the case were held in mid-July. We expect the commission decision by year-end. Next, we'll turn to Michigan. As a reminder, we obtained final regulatory approval last October for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. Engineering and procurement are essentially complete now, and construction stands at 65% complete. Our plan is to bring the new units into commercial service in the second quarter of 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. We're investing $266 million in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. They're capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost-effective long-term power supply for customers in the Upper Peninsula. And you can say it with me, we're on time and on budget. And finally, a reminder about our dividend. At our January meeting this past winter, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.5525 per share. That's an increase of 6.25% over the previous dividend rate. And as is typical, our board will assess our dividend plans for 2019 coming up in December. And now with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2018, here's our Chief Financial Officer, the famous Scott Lauber. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Gale. Our 2018 third quarter earnings of $0.74 per share were $0.06 per share higher than the third quarter of 2017. These favorable results were largely driven by higher sales volumes and continued effective cost control. Warmer than normal summer temperatures coupled with strong growth in the region drove electricity use above our forecasts. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date results for 2018 and 2017. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense, and income taxes. Referring to page 9 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the third quarter of 2018 was $303 million compared to $392 million during the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $89 million. Excluding two tax items totaling $93 million, operating income actually increased $4 million. As previously discussed on the last two calls, the first tax item reflects the benefit of tax repairs, which was part of our 2017 Wisconsin rate settlement. And the second item relates to the federal tax legislation. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on page 7 and 8 of the earnings package. Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. The plan is proceeding as expected. And then regarding the benefit of tax reform, we currently project that the transmission escrow balance at Wisconsin Electric will be reduced from approximately $220 million to $40 million or less by the end of 2019. As of September 30, 2018, the balance stands at about $125 million, nearly $100 million reduction from the year-end 2017. My segment update will focus on the $4 million increase in operating income, as shown on page 9 of the packet. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the increase in operating income net of tax adjustments was $6.5 million. Higher sales volumes drove approximately $34 million increase in margins. This was partially offset by a $20.2 million increase in operation and maintenance expense, and a $7 million increase in depreciation expense. The increase in operations and maintenance expense was largely driven by two items. The first item was a $7.9 million expense related to staff reductions as we continue to streamline processes and reshape our generation portfolio. Second, we accrued $15 million related to the earnings sharing mechanism we have in place at our Wisconsin utilities. This was a result of our strong performance year-to-date. In Illinois, operating income increased $800,000 net of tax adjustments. The increase was primarily driven by our continued investment in the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. Recall that this program is necessary to replace approximately 2,000 miles of cast iron pipes in practically one of every two streets in Chicago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating loss at our other states segment increased $4 million largely due to the timing of expenses in the quarter. Turning to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, excluding the impacts of tax reform, operating income at this segment increased by $800,000, mostly due to additional investments in our Power the Future plants. As a reminder, this segment also contains the operation at Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30, 2017 and one month of operation at Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased to $400,000 in the third quarter of 2018. Combining these changes and excluding the two tax items I discussed, operating income increased $4 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $33.7 million, a decrease of $5.5 million as compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding the $8.4 million impact from tax reform, our equity earnings increased $2.9 million driven by continued capital investment. Other income net increased by $8.3 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to decrease in the non-service cost component of our pension and benefit plans. Historically, the non-service cost component of these plans were reflected in operations and maintenance expense. However, a new accounting rule required it to be reclassified to other income in both years. Our net interest expense increased $8.2 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by continued capital investments and slightly higher interest rates. Our consolidated income taxes decreased by $113 million. As previously discussed, lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow-through of tax repairs. We expect our effective income tax rate will be between 14% and 15% this year. Excluding the benefits related to tax repairs, we expect the effective tax rate would be between 24% and 25%. These are generally in line with the expectations we provided on the last quarter call. Consistent with last quarter, we expect to be a cash taxpayer by the end of 2019. Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $263 million during the first nine months of 2018. Recall that we made $100 million contribution to our pension plan in 2017. Higher earnings, as well as the decline in working capital, contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.5 billion during the first nine months of 2018, a $181 million increase compared to the same period in 2017 as we continue to execute our capital plan. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.3% at the end of the third quarter, a decrease from the 52.5% at the end of 2017. We continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinated notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares and we continue to expect FFO-to-debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We paid $523 million in common dividends during the first nine months of 2018, an increase of $30.6 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 6.25% increase in the dividend level compared to the first nine months of 2017. Moving to sales, we continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 15,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 13, 14 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 6% for the quarter and on a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries were up 2.6%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.5% versus the third quarter of 2017. This excludes gas used for power generation. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 3.3% on a weather-normalized basis. Weather-normalized electric and natural gas volumes were above our expectations for the first nine months of 2018. Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance of $3.32 a share. As always, this projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. And as a reminder, our Wisconsin utilities are subject to an earnings sharing mechanism. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at EEI and sharing details of our capital plan, which should continue to support our ability to grow efficiently the business. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Scott, thank you very much. We're still standing and we're focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the conference call. Operator : Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi Julien, how are you? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey good, good afternoon. Congratulations. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, sir. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. I should add my congrats to Kevin there as well. So perhaps with that, I'd love to hear a little bit more on the CapEx plan articulated here. I know you addressed this, specifically the returns profile already. Just curious is that ROE change over time? Or is that pretty consistent as far as the criteria that you're employing and as best you understand the investments that you've already committed to that it's pretty consistent at that 50-50 at or above utility returns? And then also within that, if you could comment, have you \u2013 what portion of the energy infrastructure CapEx that you've delineated have you already sort of identified? I know that you've got at least one project named already thus far. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah, very good questions, Julien. Thank you. First of all, in terms of the return criteria that we're using, let me back up and say that, I view this whole infrastructure segment that we've introduced over the last 24 months really as a sign of how strong the company is. As you know, we're one of the few companies in the industry that does not have to issue equity to finance our growth, that has a tax appetite and we're seeing \u2013 because of just the backdrop in the industry I believe, we're seeing very, very good assets that we're able to take a look at and able to be very discerning in terms of the particular projects that we would actually bring into the segment. So long story short, certainly cash returns, IRRs and ROEs are all an integral part of how we look at these projects. And I do see the projects when we talk about at or above our retail rate of return for these projects, we're really looking at an average return over the course of the life of the projects. So that's, I hope, answering one of your questions. In many cases, the returns are somewhat higher in the early years, but when we look at this, we're looking at consistent returns on average across the life of the assets. And then in terms of the projects that we already have basically underway, you remember last year, we closed on the Bluewater Natural Gas storage asset. And then this year, we added the Bishop Hill III, booked first at 80% ownership interest, now at 90% ownership interest, and we're also contractually committed to bring onboard next year after construction is complete the Upstream Wind Energy Center in Antelope County, Nebraska. So in essence, one way to look at it is with Upstream coming on-stream next year, about 20% of the segment amount for the next five years is already in-house, if you will. And we have a number of projects in the pipeline that we're looking at. Some of which I think will come to fruition, but we have a very good robust pipeline of projects that we are taking a look at. Rest assured, we will be disciplined. And we're not going to do something that materially changes our risk profile and we're not going to do something that does not meet our return criteria. I hope that helps, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. Excellent. And just a quick follow-up, a clarification, just with respect to the precise succession timing as you all think about it and don't mean to pin you down here and now but how are you thinking about it? Just the timeline here if you will? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: For CEO succession? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Just to make sure we've got that clear. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Okay. Sure. Well, we have not set a timetable for any additional change at the CEO level. So I think, Julien, you'll have me around to ask questions to for quite a while. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Very good. Thank you, Julien. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is open. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good morning. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Yeah. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you doing, Greg? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I'm good. Before I ask you any questions, do you have any questions for me about the Jets? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I kind of do, but we'll save those for later. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: By the way, my Bucks are 7-0. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : They do look good. Basketball is not New York's forte right now. That is for sure. So I've got a couple questions. The first is I know that and I asked you about this on the second quarter call, so I'd just love your observations after another quarter has gone by. I know that there's a lot of activity out at the Foxconn site, but there continues to be some question about exactly what they are going to build there. Now, I know they're committed at a high level to a level of investment and a level of job creation, but the level of economic demand pull for energy that comes from both that site and from the follow-on investment for the supply chain will be a big driver for what you ultimately have to invest to serve the region. And so I'm wondering at this point, given that the increase in the CapEx budget, while it was substantial, wasn't demonstrably in the core electricity business, what you're waiting for in terms of visibility so that we can then get a sense of what you're going to need to invest to support the economic growth that comes from that? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good questions all, Greg, and let me take them one at a time. First of all, let me try to clarify the changes in our five-year capital plan compared to the previous plan for 2018 through 2022. What you see basically is an increase in the natural gas delivery segment because, again, we are seeing growth across the board in terms of all of our customer segments in terms of natural gas demand. And that includes about $140 million of capital that we expect to spend in the area that Foxconn is being developed. So when you look at our capital spending, our focus remains clearly on the regulated business and the growth opportunities that we need to serve customers reliably in the regulated business. The increase in the natural gas delivery segment was somewhat offset by a slight decrease in transmission. And there, American Transmission is coming off of two very large projects that they're completing inside the footprint. And as you know, some of the transmission is a bit episodic and project by project. So the downturn we're seeing here in the American Transmission Company piece of the budget is really just reflecting the completion of two very large capital projects. On the energy infrastructure piece that we talk about, it's only 10% of our projected capital spending for the next five years. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands. Our focus is still clearly on the growth in the regulated business and the investments we need to maintain reliability and great customer service. But we do see growth particularly in the natural gas delivery segment. Now to Foxconn itself, they are in the final stages of completing their design for that entire campus, and our technical people meet with their folks literally every week. The changes that they have made so far have really had no material effect on the projected demand for electricity that we're seeing. We've been seeing for a number of months as they refine their designs a demand of about 180 megawatts, and that's still in place. So I think to be honest with you, and we've seen some articles that frankly are absolute hit pieces, there's a lot going on right now, just tremendous progress on the campus and across the state. And in fact, just a few weeks ago the Chairman of Foxconn committed to a $100 million contribution to the engineering school at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. So they are full speed ahead from everything we can tell. And in terms of the catalytic effect that I mentioned, there's already been announced in the area, within a few miles of where the Foxconn campus is going to be, there's already been announced $300 million of additional capital investment by non-related parties, medical complexes, hospitals, hotels, business parks. It's really amazing to see the immediate catalytic effect, and I think we're just at the front end of it. So that's my summation of where we are. And again, from everything we can tell, even though their design has changed a bit, the fact that they're building what they call a Gen 6 instead of a Gen 10.5 fabrication facility hasn't changed what we're seeing in terms of either their demand for electricity or the catalytic effect that we're seeing that we expected to see. Let me just put one number to it. We did a study. This was not a government study, this was something that we did with an outside econometric firm. And if Foxconn delivers on all the promises it has made we expect it to, and earns all the state tax credits, we would expect $54 billion over the next 15 years of new economic activity for the state, $54 billion, which would be about a return of 18 :1 of the state tax credits. So that's my summation, Greg. I hope that helps. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : It does, thanks. That's all good. I'll hop off there. That's really thorough, thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Michael. How are you doing? Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi guys. Hey, Gale, how are you doing? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're good. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Glad to hear it. Hey, if the returns are very similar to regulated returns on the energy infrastructure business, why limit it to 10%? Is there any risk that is not apparent that might want you \u2013 that might force you to limit to 10% or make it desirable to limit it in some way? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Michael, if I'm understanding your question, is there any risk that we see that might put the 10% returns in danger? Again, we're only looking at projects... Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: No. I'm thinking the 10%, like limiting it to 10% of earnings, I think that's what you were referring to before, right? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, no. What I meant was 10% of our capital spending plan for the next five years. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And why limit it to that? Why have any limitations on it if it's having the same kind of returns of the utility? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: To be honest with you, we are seeing enough significant opportunity directly in our retail regulated business that we're also seeing increased capital opportunities there. So we want to keep a reasonable balance here. If we saw some incredible opportunity that put us above the 10% of capital spending in that segment in the next five years, we will certainly do it. But I think that's a reasonable estimate at this point and again in part because we're also seeing really good opportunities in our core. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. And also the $140 million that you alluded to for extra gas spending limits directly tied to the Foxconn site, is that for primary service to Foxconn itself? Or is that secondary service to surrounding community needs or growing community needs? Or is it some combination of both? And then a follow-up question to that would be, you also said that this is just the very beginning stages of something that is going to be huge. Is that also the same \u2013 is the $140 million also the beginning of some potentially huge opportunity, just the tip of the iceberg, if you will? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Michael, just to be clear, the $140 million that we've actually filed for approval, the $140 million of gas distribution projects that we filed for approval with the Commission represents the additional investment that we think we're going to need to accommodate the economic growth in the region. So it's Foxconn plus, if you will, so that's about $140 million investment, two separate gas distribution projects. Because we simply don't have enough infrastructure in terms of natural gas delivery in that area right now to accommodate both Foxconn's growth and the additional growth we're starting to see. Could the natural gas delivery segment grow even faster? If we see additional economic growth beyond what we're projecting in that area, yes. But at the moment, I think that initial $140 million investment will cover us for the next several years. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you, thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi guys. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: How are you doing? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good. Well, thanks for taking my question. I guess the catalytic effect was actually quite an interesting point and it clearly sounds like a big opportunity around Foxconn going forward. How should we think about it though from a growth and opportunity perspective? If that plays out, is that increasing your growth from the 6% going forward? Or do you think about it more as maintaining the 6% but helping keep the build pressure down through that cycle? How should we kind of frame the opportunity from a utility perspective? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Great question and I think it's the latter. I mean, first of all, there's no question in my mind that all the economic development we're seeing. I mentioned Komatsu which is a major project right in the harbor district in Milwaukee. There's HARIBO, the candy company that's coming to Southeastern Wisconsin. Milwaukee Electric Tool has had two major expansions. Amazon a couple of years ago built a huge distribution center and is expanding or has expanded that distribution center. So all of that really is \u2013 and the investment opportunity for infrastructure, a regulated infrastructure that we need to make to support all that growth. I think that is in my mind basically giving us an even longer runway to our 5% to 7% or in the middle of the range low 6% growth rate. And definitely with stronger kilowatt hour sales and you'll see as we roll out our plans in more detail at EEI, you'll see we've raised our projected growth rate of sales for both natural gas and electricity a bit. That's also helping to keep rate pressure down. No question about it. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. That's helpful color. And then secondly, I mean given all this opportunity that you have around investment, both on the regulated and the unregulated side, I guess the constraining factor must be the balance sheet and the credit. And so just to understand that, you're clearly getting to be a cash taxpayer by 2019, so I guess at some point the metrics would come a little bit of pressure in 2021 as you become a cash taxpayer. Should we think about that as a constraining factor in terms of how much you can push from a credit perspective or holdco debt perspective? How should we think about credit in the context of this opportunity? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I'll start and then I'm going to ask Scott for his view to give you as well. I would say this, I mean, and we did say we would expect absent any other infrastructure projects that we would become a cash taxpayer next year. But again, we have the tax appetite to be able to take on some very good projects that don't change our risk profile. So I don't particularly see \u2013 we are going to maintain a strong balance sheet, we're going to maintain our credit rating, we're going to maintain the FFO metrics where we need them to be. But I don't see that as a huge deterrent at this point. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, no, you're exactly correct, Gale. That 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt is right in line, in fact we're running at the high end of that this year. And as you look at opportunities, and you take 100% bonus depreciation perhaps on another project or two will even help our FFO in the other years. So we're comfortable in that 16% to 18%, we just want to be realistic on the opportunities and how we'd roll out our capital plan. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks, Scott. So you don't see it even in 2021 any pressure to that 16% to 18% coming down or staying at the lower end of that 16% to 18%. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. Not at this time. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, not at this time. No. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Great. Much appreciated, guys. Thanks so much. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Thank you for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Gale. Thanks for taking my question. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I actually have one small housekeeping item which is, if I look at your $3.32 in EPS guidance for the year, and then the $2.70-ish or so you've done year-to-date, that implies $0.62 for the fourth quarter. That's below fourth quarter last year by a decent chunk. Just curious was there something in the fourth quarter last year that was unusual or abnormal that was a benefit that you might not get in this fourth quarter? Or is there something else fundamental or just one time in nature that is happening in the fourth quarter? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good question, Michael. And I think \u2013 and I'll ask Scott to give you some details on this. But long story short, our performance at the Wisconsin utilities has been very strong this year. And you remember the earnings sharing mechanism that we have in place with anything above our allowed retail rate of return. So, in essence, any outperformance that we would have in the fourth quarter of this year would basically be subject to the earnings sharing and therefore not flow through to our bottom line earnings per share report. So, you have to take into account where we were last year with earnings sharing and where we were this year. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. That's exactly it. So going into last year's fourth quarter, we were not into earnings sharing. And between fuel and weather, we gained about $0.09 and just started to get into that sharing mechanism of about $2 million. And like Gale said, we're near the top of that 50-50 band now. So the opportunity for additional $0.09 doesn't exist. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. One other thing, I'm going to sound like a broken record, you can go back and read transcripts for the last two and half years... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You know when I can't get to sleep at night, I go back and where were the Michael questions? Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Well, it's the same question every time because your demand growth numbers are clearly conservative, they have been for two, two and half, almost three years on the gas side, any thoughts on the fact that they maybe also conservative on the electric side as well? And what would have to happen to make you rebase higher? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I think when you see all the details of our capital plan and our projections going forward, we have rebased a little bit. We were basically projecting flat almost 0% to 0.5% electric demand growth. I think Scott is adding almost 1% to that in terms of annual expectation of electric demand growth in light of the opportunity we're seeing. And then we're also rebasing up just a hair our natural gas expectation for growth as well. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That's correct. And this last year across-the-board and every class we're seeing that natural gas. So having stable gas prices I don't \u2013 residential customer growth is good but still as appliances get replaced, they're just becoming more efficient. So, I just have a hard time seeing residential continue to grow at that same pace year-over-year other than new customers. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it guys. Thank you. Much appreciated, Gale, Scott. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome, Michael. See you soon. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan, a question for you, I've been meaning to ask, how's your mom doing in England? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, yeah. She is fine. Thank you. Gale, they haven't deported me yet, but we'll see how we go with that. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, she's still getting good electricity from my former company I take it. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, indeed. So just on the capital plan you gave us the 10% number. I mean, this might be something you'd rather save for EEI, but when you showed that graphic before, the energy infrastructure was 8% for the capital plan excluding transmission. Are we now talking about 10% on the same basis? Or is it 10% of the $14.1 billion? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. It's 10% of the $14.1 billion. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then on transmission, just looking back, I think what you had said was that you were booking 10.82%. But you expect it to migrate to something like 10.20% ROE at some point. My question is at what point in your sort of projection of this earnings, the 6% level, do you see that migration happening? And then if you have any comments on this related machinations out of FERC on the model? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, Jonathan, you're correct on both counts. We're still booking because that's the allowed rate of return today, the 10.82% on our earnings from American Transmission Company. As you know there have been a number of complaints from around the country pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from customers asking whether or not the current allowed rates of return on transmission all over the U.S. are \"in the zone of reasonableness or not.\" As you know, FERC has begun to take some action. The first indication of where they might go just came probably 10 days, two weeks ago, when they began looking at the complaint that's on their docket from the Northeastern United States, the Northeastern Utilities, if you will. And FERC has laid out for comment a proposed new methodology, which combines four different metrics as opposed to just a single metric that they have been using in the past. Again, I think it's going to be a while before we get any clarity from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because I believe first of all there's a 60-day comment period. That puts us close to the end of December, so I would expect them to take some action in the first half or first quarter of next year. And then I would guess that the Midwestern complaints would be on the docket after that. But we are still assuming that the 10.2% will come down, and our conservative estimate right now is 10.2%. And that 10.2% is embedded in our 5% to 7% growth rate, Scott. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That's correct. So we haven't made a final determination of when we think it will go down yet, but for our five-year plan we're assuming it goes to the 10.2%, which that includes the 50 basis point adder for being part of MISO. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you for that clarity. And then just on the \u2013 you gave some pretty explicit guidance on where you see earnings within the range. Do you see with this plan a reasonably linear trajectory, or is it possible to start out higher and migrate lower, that way you have less visibility at the back end, just any \u2013 or was that intended more as throughout the plan type of level? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: It really was intended pretty much to be linear throughout the plan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. That's all I have. Thank you, Gale. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome, Jonathan. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: How are you, Gale? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: We're good. How are you, Paul? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good. Just along the lines of a previous question, the 10% of the CapEx budget being for the infrastructure segment, is that constrained at all by your statement that you won't issue equity? If you're willing to issue equity, could you make that bigger? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: If we wanted to issue equity, we could make it bigger, I assume. But again, we are being very, very disciplined in terms of the projects that we want to bring into this segment. So I think the reason we landed on this particular number for the Energy Infrastructure segment and the reason we ended up at 10% of our expected capital spend over the next five years with basically 20% of it already done, is \u2013 that's about the quality of the projects we're looking at. I think since we're being very disciplined and very risk-averse here, and we're not going to change our risk profile, that amount is about what I think we can spend in terms of the kind of projects we want to bring in-house. So it's really constrained more by our disciplined approach, by our return criteria than it is, I think, Scott, by any type of financial constraint. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No. If opportunities came, we'd have room to even do more than that 5% to 7% without issuing any equity. So it's not the financial, it's more of the opportunities to make sure we're realistic in the expectations to achieve our returns. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you, that's helpful. And then just on the FERC ROEs, are you reserving at all against the 10.82%? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No, the 10.82% we are not. There is one complaint period that does exist that is open yet, and that is reserved at that 10.2% level. But that's the open complaint period that we're waiting to hear the final results on. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: And then on the FERC rules, basically the 10.2% \u2013 for this period the 10.2% is basically the allowed return. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: The 10.82%. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: I'm sorry the 10.82%, yes, is the allowed return. So other than the one complaint period that Scott talked about where we do have a reserve, we don't think there's any real challenge ability to basically take on the 10.82% because that is the allowed return for this period. Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Correct. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Ciciarelli with Bank of America. Your line is open. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Good afternoon, Richard, how are you? Richard is not well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, I think it's Julien here again. Can you hear me? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry, sneaking on here real quickly. Can I just clarify real quickly? Just in the transcript it looks like you might have said a different earnings base than you might have meant for 2018 for the midpoint of the guidance? You introduced 2018 earnings guidance earlier this year at $3.26 to $3.30. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : The midpoint of that is the new base, right? At $3.28, is that correct? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That is exactly correct. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I just wanted to clarify that for the transcript. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome Julien. I think you are trick-or-treating and masquerading as one of your analysts. Operator : Your next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Vedula. How are you today? Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : I'm doing well, Gale. Hey, good luck to your Brewers next year. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, my Bucks are 7-0. Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : Okay, something to look forward to. My question was mostly what Greg had asked about more with Foxconn. And obviously, there's a lot of noise around it and lots of politics and posturing or whatever. But within all of that, what is it that we should really pay attention to, to find out whether in fact there may be some lag or some give or whatever term you want to use in terms of what maybe some people thought about either its timing or its scale of capital investment relating to what we believe we've heard about originally? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Everything we're seeing is Foxconn is full speed ahead. Now we do have a gubernatorial election here and there have been some discussions by the Democratic candidate for governor on whether or not he would want to relook the incentive package for Foxconn. If that were to happen I mean if he were to be elected and he decided to find some way to overturn legislation that's in place that probably would be a factor that you would want to look at in terms of whether or not there would be some slowdown in the Foxconn plan. But right now given what Foxconn is actually doing on the campus, the construction progress they're making, the additional investments across the state that they've announced, right now it appears that they are full speed ahead. Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : Okay, I appreciate the clarification. Thank you. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint. Your line is open. Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP : Hey, Gale. How are you? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hey, Andy. I'm great. How are you doing? Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP : I'm doing well. Just back to Julien's last question just to make sure. So I guess when you made your first comment, the Bloomberg transcript picked up $3.20 as the midpoint, which obviously wasn't your guidance. So you're growing off of $3.28, is that correct? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: That is correct. That is correct and we'll have to sue Bloomberg for fake news. Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP : Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Okay. Thank you very much. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're welcome Andy. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Hi, Paul. What's shaking? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Not much. What I wanted to ask you about was just sort of back on the infrastructure projects. You mentioned that the returns might be on the high side initially in terms of how you're looking at the trajectory of the return. And I'm just wondering if you could sort of give a little bit more flavor as to when we look at this CapEx, what the earnings profile is over time, do you follow me? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Sure. And again, over time with the projects that we have in hand and the projects we have announced, we would expect over time over kind of our useful life of the project the returns to meet the kind of criteria we talked about which is at or slightly above our retail rates of return. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Right. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is that, you made it sound like some of it might be frontend loaded. And so what I'm wondering is, I understand that on average over time that's what it would be, but it sounds like some of it might be frontend loaded, and so I wanted to get more of a sense as to how that might be distributed? Do you follow me? How much of a boost we might be seeing in the early years versus later years? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Let me frame that for you and then I'll let Scott give you some detail. The projects we're talking about really are in many cases either solar or wind or gas storage or some type of renewables. Particularly with the wind, you have a very heavy tax credit influence in the early years. Scott? Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, specifically, the two projects we've had so far on the wind side, production tax credits are in the first 10 years, so the returns are north of that 10% by a couple of percentage points in that first 10-year period along with good cash returns because of the bonus depreciation. So it's really that first 10 years when you have the production tax credits that really make it a little higher on average. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So really we're going to be looking \u2013 sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you. Go ahead. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: No problem. I also was going to say actually believe it or not because of the cash returns, it's helpful to our FFO to debt calculation. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, sure. So, okay \u2013 so we're talking basically like the PTC kind of concept, so we're talking like a good period of time where you'll be having the higher returns versus you won't be having \u2013 there are no big upfront benefits to EPS. This is more just a 10-year timeframe where you're going to be... Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Right. Right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. Just wanted to make sure about that. And then the other question that I have is, so there's a decrease in electric generation in the ATC and you mentioned something about the ROE, and I apologize if I just wasn't completely clear on this. But the ATC \u2013 the fall off in the CapEx, did that have to do with what you're seeing in terms of returns and what have you? Or could you just clarify a little bit about what's driving the change in CapEx profile at ATC and if it has anything to do with the ROE cases that you're seeing? Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Nothing whatsoever to do with the ROE cases. Everything to do with the fact that ATC is just completing two very large construction projects, transmission project extensions and new transmission in our footprint. And they're rolling off these two very large projects from a year. So we have a high year comparing to a slightly lower year, but it has nothing to do with the potential change in ROE. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, most of my questions were answered. So thanks so much. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: You're more than welcome. Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.: Well, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for joining us. If you have any additional questions feel free to call Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Thanks everybody. See you on the West Coast. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you all that statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar yea 2018. First, I would like to make sure that everyone is familiar with the recent changes we made at the most senior level of our organization. The Board of Directors has approved the creation of the Office of the Chair, staffed by for company veterans. We will work together as a team to write the next chapter of our companies growth and service to customers. As of February 1, my title changed to Executive Chairman. I have agreed to stay in this role for the next three years. And as Executive Chair, I will take the lead on Board governance, corporate strategy, investor relations and economic development. I am also delighted that Kevin Fletcher has been promoted to Chief Executive. Kevin is a member of the Office of the Chair and will serve on the WEC Energy Group Board of Directors. Kevin will continue to report directly to me and his main focus will be the direction and performance of our seven customer facing utilities. In addition, the Office of the Chair includes Rick Kuester. Rick continues to serve as Senior Executive Vice President. He will have broad responsibility for the company's capital investment plan, information technology and power generation. Last but not least, Scott Lauber. Scott has been named Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. He will be responsible for all of our finance related functions. This team, as you know, has delivered industry leading results over many years with a clear commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Our focus remains on the fundamentals of our business and on developing the next generation of leadership for our company. And now, I would like to introduce the members of our management team who are here in the room with us today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Guc, our Controller, Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations and of course, Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO of WEC Energy Group. Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full-year 2018 earnings of $3.34 a share. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance during this past year. On virtually every meaningful measure, we made significant progress. We delivered solid earnings and dividend growth. We reached milestones in network reliability, customer satisfaction and company support. We made significant strides upgrading the natural gas infrastructure in Chicago and building a long-term solution for the power supply in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We were again named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in America by Corporate Responsibility magazine and we made real progress in reducing our carbon dioxide emissions. In fact, we are on track to exceed our goal of 40% reduction below 2005 levels by the year 2030. Now we expect to achieve that goal by 2023. And we have set our sights on an 80% reduction by the year 2050. Last year alone, we retired nearly 1,500 megawatts of older less efficient coal fired generation. All-in-all, the company continues to perform at a very high level. During 2018, we also identified several promising investments in our infrastructure segment. On December 28, we acquired an 80% interest in the Coyote Ridge Wind Farm that's located in Brookings County, South Dakota. This wind farm is currently being built by Avangrid Renewables and is expected to be in service before the end of 2019. Coyote Ridge will consist of 39 turbines with a capacity of roughly 97 megawatts. We expect to invest approximately $145 million for our 80% share of the wind farm. Unique to this transaction, we will be entitled to 99% of the tax benefits. We paid $60 million in December with the final payment coming due after commercial operation is achieved. Under the tax rules, we expect the wind farm to qualify for production tax credits and for 100% bonus depreciation. The project has a 12 year offtake agreement with Google, Google Energy LLC, for all of the energy produced. Now for a quick update on our previously announced investment in the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. As you recall, in late June, we announced an agreement to acquire 80% in the Bishop Hill II wind farm located in Henry County, Illinois. We closed on that acquisition in late August. Then this past December, we took advantage of an opportunity to increase our equity interest. We now have a 90% ownership interest in Bishop Hill III. As a reminder, this wind farm was developed by Invenergy and was placed into service in May of 2018. It consists of 53 turbines with a capacity of 132 megawatts. In total, our investment is $166 million. The project has a very long-term 22-year offtake agreement with one of our current wholesale customers, WPPI Energy. WPPI, of course, is based here in Wisconsin and has 51 member utilities. Turning quickly now to our investment in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. On August 20, we received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to purchase an 80% ownership interest in the upstream project. We closed on this transaction just about a month ago on January 10 at a purchase price of $276 million. As a reminder, Upstream is located in Antelope County, Nebraska and consists of 81 turbines with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts. The project has a long-term 10-year offtake agreement with an affiliate of Allianz, which is an A-rated publicly traded company. We are very encouraged about these investments in renewable energy. We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns and specifically we are projecting an unlevered internal rate of return above 8% or in the mid-teens on a levered basis. And we are projecting returns on equity based on a 50-50 capital structure at or above our retail returns. I would remind everyone though that these infrastructure investments make up just a small piece of our overall five-year capital plan. As you know, we have a tax appetite and we are being very selective as we vet future projects. We are only interested in projects that do not change our risk profile and achieve our financial returns. We are also making progress on our quest to add utility-scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets. To refresh your memory, on May 31, 2018, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations right here in Wisconsin. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in southwestern part of the state in Iowa County and will be developed by Invenergy. The Two Creeks solar project will be located in the City of Two Rivers in northeastern Wisconsin and actually that's near the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant. The Two Creeks project is being developed by NextEra. Our Wisconsin Public Service company will own 100 megawatts at each site. We have an expected investment of approximately $260 million. We expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission in March or early April. And with regulatory approval, the projects could be in commercial service by the end of 2020. As many of you know, over the past few years, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost-effective option now for our customers, the option that also fits well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, we recently received approval from the Wisconsin Commission for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now program, as we call it and the dedicated renewable energy resource pilot could bring another 185 megawatts of clean solar and wind energy to our regulated portfolio of assets. And the solar now program will provide us with valuable insights into operating distributed generation. And now let's switch gears for a bit and take a look at the economy in our region. Wisconsin's published unemployment rate has been 3% or lower since February of last year. And folks, that's the longest stretch of near full employment in state history. The state continues also to witness significant economic development. For example, just in November, Amazon announced plans for a new state-of-the-art fulfillment center in Oak Creek, a suburb of Milwaukee. Amazon plans to invest $200 million in the project, a 2.6 million square feet facility on 75 acres. Amazon expects to employ 1,500 workers at this site. Distribution center is scheduled to open in early 2020 and will feature state-of-the-art robotics to pack, pick and ship small items to customers. And looking just a few miles further south of Milwaukee, Foxconn has made tangible progress on its high-tech manufacturing and research campus. So far, Foxconn has invested $200 million in Wisconsin. They have moved four million cubic yards of dirt so far in the construction of the Wisconn Valley Science & Technology Park. The first building on the campus is now complete. It's a 120,000 square foot multipurpose building. To date, more than 1,000 jobs have been created in support of the project. And Foxconn has also expanded its presence across the state, buying buildings in Green Bay and Eau Claire and Racine, buildings that are expected to become Foxconn Innovation Centers. In addition, we are beginning to see the positive ripple effect that we expected with multiple commercial and industrial announcements spring economic growth within just a few miles of the Foxconn campus. As you know, over the past few weeks, there has been a good deal of speculation about Foxconn's future plans for Wisconsin. Just a few days ago, Foxconn issued a clarifying statement noting that its plans do include a fabrication plant and filling 13,000 jobs. But a number of you have asked, whether a potential change in direction by Foxconn could impact the growth we are forecasting or our capital spending plans. The short answer is, we have remained very conservative in our projections. In fact, we weren't projecting a significant ramp up from Foxconn until 2023. And now, I will turn the call over to Kevin for some additional insight on our operations and our regulatory calendar for 2019. Kevin, all yours. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you Gale. First, I have some good news to share. Our largest subsidiary, We Energies, was named the most reliable electric utility in the Midwest for the eighth year running. That's a testament to our employees and our focus on building and maintaining resilient infrastructure. And our employees did an excellent job keeping our customers warm during the polar vortex last month. We hit record peaks for natural gas distribution our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan service territories. In addition, we achieved the highest customer satisfaction ratings in the nation in JD Power Survey of large business and industrial customers served by electric utilities across the country. We also were named by Forbes magazine as one of America's best employers for diversity for 2019. Now I would like to briefly review where we stand in our four state jurisdictions. As we look ahead in Wisconsin, we plan to file a general rate case for all of our Wisconsin utilities this spring. We would expect that new retail rates would go into affect in January 2020. As a reminder, customers have benefited from a base rate freeze for the past four years and more recently from tax reform. In fact, after factoring in our fuel cost and federal tax reform, our retail rates in Wisconsin are actually lower today than they were in 2015. Turning to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Plan. As a reminder, this program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. For many years to come, we will be replacing outdated natural gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago with state-of-the-art materials. This past year, we invested approximately $295 million in the effort and we expect the project to continue through 2035. And now a word about our Minnesota utility, Minnesota Energy Resources. On December 26 of last year, the Commission approved a rate increase of $3.1 million or 1.26% effective January 1, 2018. The order also increased the equity ratio to 50.9% and the allowed return on equity to 9.7%. The Minnesota Attorney General has requested a review of the authorized ROE in the order. Now we will turn to Michigan. We are nearing completion of the new natural gas-fired generation in the upper Peninsula. Engineering, procurement and construction are essentially complete. Startup as well underway and we anticipate commercial operation as planned in the second quarter of this year. And at that time or soon thereafter, we will expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. We are investing $266 million in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them RICE units. They will be capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for the customers in the upper Peninsula. And with that, I will turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you very much. The new year is off to a strong start. We are on track to meet our 2019 guidance. If you recall, that's in the range of $3.48 a share to $3.52 a share. This guidance translates to a growth rate between 6.1% and 7.3% of our 2018 base of $3.28 a share. Recall that the $3.28 was the midpoint of our original guidance for 2018. And finally, a word about our dividend policy. At this January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.59 per share. That's an increase of 6.8% over the previous rate. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.36 a share. This will mark the 16th consecutive year that our company will reward our shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We are smack dab in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now with details on our 2018 results and our outlook for 2019 is our famous CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thanks Gale. Our 2018 GAAP earnings were $3.34 per share compared to $3.79 per share in 2017. The 2017 results included the impact of tax reform on the company's non-utility assets and assets of the parent company. Excluding this deferred tax benefit, our 2017 adjusted earnings were $3.14 per share. Comparable results for 2018 were $3.34 per share with no adjustments. This represents an increase of $0.20 per share or 6.4% over adjusted earnings for 2017. For rest of my presentation, I will refer exclusively to adjusted earnings for 2017. Our solid 2018 results were largely driven by additional capital investment, effective cost control and higher sales volumes. Earnings benefited from both warmer than normal summer weather and colder than normal winter across all of our jurisdictions. The favorable weather coupled with economic growth drive energy use significantly above our forecasts. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of fourth quarter and full year 2018 and 2017 results. My focus will be on the full year, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 13 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2018 was $1,468 million as compared to operating income of $1,776 million in 2017, a decrease of $308 million. Excluding two tax items, operating income actually increased by $88 million. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on page 9 and 10 of the earnings package. Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. That plan continues to proceed as expected. We now project that the transmission escrow balance [AUDIO GAP] Excludes the impact of the tax items. Starting with the Wisconsin segment. The increase in operating income, net of tax adjustments was $53.1 million. Higher sales volumes drove a $92.1 million increase in margins. This was partially offset by $28.1 million increase in depreciation expense and a $7.4 million increase in operations and maintenance expense. The increase in O&M expense was largely driven by two items. The first item was a $7 million expense related to staff reductions as we continue to streamline process and reshape our generation portfolio. Second, we accrued $64.6 million more in 2018 related to the earnings sharing mechanism we have in place at our Wisconsin Utilities. This was a result of our strong performance in 2018. Excluding these two items, operations and maintenance expense actually decreased $64.2 million driven by the closing of coal plants and effective cost control across the business. In Illinois, operating income increased $5.4 million net of tax adjustments. The increase was primarily driven by our continued investment in the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at our other states segment increased $22.4 million. Higher sales volumes resulting from colder winter weather and customer growth drove a $10 million increase year-over-year. We also benefited from an increase in revenues to the Minnesota rate case. Recall that interim rates have been in place since January 1, 2018. The remaining increase of $4.8 million was attributable to a favorable judgment received on a property tax matter. Turning now to our energy infrastructure segment. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at this segment was up $15.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30, 2017, contributed $13.6 million to the increase in operating income. The remaining increase was driven by additional investments at our Power the Future plan. The results also reflect the acquisition of our interest in Bishop Hill in the fall 2018. Recall that a portion of the earnings from this facility come in the form of production tax credits and is recognized as an offset to income tax expense. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased by $8.3 million. The change is primarily due to impairment recorded on some nonregulated assets that we inherited from the Integrys acquisition. Combining these changes and excluding the two tax items I discussed, operating income increased $88 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $136.7 million, a decrease of $17.6 million as compared to 2017. Excluding the impact from the tax reform, our equity earnings increased by $16.7 million. Higher earnings were driven by continued capital investment and the absence of a FERC audit expense that was recorded in 2017. Other income net decreased by $3.4 million year-over-year. Our net interest expense increased $29.4 million, primarily driven by higher debt balances related to our continued capital investment and slightly higher interest rates. Our adjusted consolidated income tax expense decreased $420 million. As previously discussed, lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow through of tax repairs. The effective tax rate was 13.8% in 2018. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, our effective tax rate would have been 24%. Looking forward to 2019, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5%. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, we expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. We are projecting a lower rate in 2019 because of production tax credits from our infrastructure investments. We now expect to be a partial taxpayer in 2020. Looking now at the cash flow statement at page 8 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $367 million during 2018. Stronger earnings contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures were actually $2.1 billion for 2018, $156 million increase from 2017, reflecting continued investment in our core business. In 2018, our FFO to debt was 20.7% due to strong cash flow as previously discussed. Looking forward, we continue to expect FFO to debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $697 million in common dividends during 2018, an increase of $41 million over 2017 which reflect the increase to the annualized dividend level in 2018. Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2018, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 19,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on pages 16 and 17 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% from 2017 and on a weather normalized basis, retail deliveries were up 1.2%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 9.1% versus 2017. This excludes gas used for power generation. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 4.3% on a weather normalized basis. Overall electric and natural gas volumes were above our expectations for 2018. And I will briefly touch on our 2019 sales forecast for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. We are forecasting a slight increase of 0.3% in weather normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine. We project Wisconsin weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.8%. And finally, let's look at the first quarter of 2019 guidance. In the first quarter last year, we earned $1.23 per share. The first quarter of 2018 was helped by approximately $0.04 of positive fuel recoveries related to market conditions. Taking this factor into account, we project first quarter 2019 earnings to be in a range of the $1.23 per share to $1.25 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. With that, I will turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. I might add, the Milwaukee Bucks have the best record in the NBA. So, operator, we are ready to rock and open it up now for the question-and-answer portion of our call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Praful. How are you? How are you today? Praful Mehta : Good. Thank you for taking the question. And I appreciate your comments on Foxconn. I wouldn't get into that because you have already addressed it on the call. I wanted to get a little bit more specific in terms of that cash tax comment that you made earlier and the fact that you will become partial cash taxpayer in 2020. I was looking at the cash flow statement and there is a meaningful deferred tax addback right now that is benefiting cash flows and operating cash flows. How does that cash flow get impacted as you move towards more of being a cash taxpayer? And does that mean any pressure on your credit metrics in that 2020, 2021 timeframe? Gale Klappa : Well, a great question and I will ask Scott to address it. First of all, though, just to kind of frame the answer in context for you. We are saying now that we are projecting to be a partial cash taxpayer in 2020, but that assumes no additional investments in the infrastructure segment that would provide in essence additional tax credits. So that's a snapshot in time today just taking into account the infrastructure investments that we have already announced. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. That's exactly it, Gale. And when you look at it, if you look at the cash flow statement, the cash flow statement is never as straightforward as you would hope. There is a lot of different pieces. The money we are saving on taxes, some of it is flowing against regulatory assets, et cetera. So we didn't pay cash taxes in 2017 or 2018 and right now we don't expect in 2019. And like Gale said, a partial in 2020. So, some of these cash taxes, the deferred taxes, that's a long unwind as we look across it as we work into a rate case. Gale Klappa : Some of that unwind goes out 15 to 20 years. Praful Mehta : Got it. So you don't foresee in the 2021 timeframe any pressure on credit that would, given your high growth and your investment, is there any kind of need for equity is what I am trying to get that, I guess, through the credit question? Scott Lauber : No. And that's why we are being very diligent on these infrastructure projects that pushes out to 2020 now. Gale Klappa : But no additional plans for equity. Period, end of story. Praful Mehta : Okay. Great. Always good to clarify. I guess, the other question I wanted to get was, you had this slide where you talked about load growth and this was in your January update. And you seemed to have like a higher load growth projection on slide 25 of that deck in that 2022, 2023 timeframe of 1.2% to 1.5%, both on the electric and gas side. Just wanted to understand what's driving that increase? Is it the industrial load that you are seeing? Or is it something else that is driving that load growth? And how would that correlate to the 5% to 7% growth that you are talking about more generally on the earnings side? Gale Klappa : Okay. Great question. Let me try to give the two or three pieces to the answer. And the first is that I mentioned that we are already seeing a significant amount of ripple effect economic development, partially from the Foxconn investments that are going on. But also, if you recall, we have had other major investments announced just in the last 24 months. In addition to Foxconn, the German candy manufacturer, Haribo is coming in with one of the largest confectionery plants in North America. They are going to be breaking ground later this year. So we will see some uptick from that development later on in our forecast period. I mentioned Amazon, which will be cranking up in late 2020. Milwaukee Electric Tool is just adding another huge expansion. And then in the fall this past year, we announced. Komatsu, a major mining manufacturing company is going to build a huge manufacturing complex just south of downtown Milwaukee in the Harbor District. When you put that together with the other economic development projects that some smaller also very meaningful that we are already seeing in the pipeline and have been announced and those factors are driving an uptick in our projection of sales growth for the latter part of this five-year forecast period. Scott, anything to add to that? Scott Lauber : No. That's exactly it. It takes a while because these are just starting construction. Gale Klappa : And all of that will still, we believe, keep us in that 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Praful Mehta : Got you. That's great. Much appreciated, guys. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Afternoon, Michael. How are you doing today? Michael Weinstein : Good. How are you doing? Gale Klappa : We are sitting here and stuck in a snow belt. Have got a foot of snow out there. Michael Weinstein : I had a question about the infrastructure business. I think in the past you said you wanted to grow that to about 3% of the total asset base. Could you just remind us what is the goal and timeframe for that goal and where you stand now versus that goal? Gale Klappa : Well, what we talked about really when we said about 3% of the asset base is that it's a small percentage of our total five-year capital plan. So in the five-year capital plan, in essence, we have got about just over $1 billion budgeted for this particular segment of capital spending. Basically, the one we just announced, the Coyote Ridge project, is the project that would have been a 2019 project, that's already done. We already have the contracts signed. The project will come in line. We come online, we believe, towards the end of 2019. So we are a good ways along with Bishop Hill, with the Upstream and with Coyote Ridge. We are, I would say, about 40% toward that goal, Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. Gale, you are exactly right. We have all the projects announced that we have in our capital spending through 2019 already. And right now, we are looking at 3% was really in the five-year plan that we were talking. And remember, we really look at that Bluewater Gas Storage as really extension of our Wisconsin business, because these are all Wisconsin utilities. Gale Klappa : And Michael, as I have mentioned to you, we can be, given our competitive advantage, with our tax appetite, with the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to use the production tax credits, we are in a very competitive position. So as we set future projects, we have a very really robust list of future projects to choose from. And as I mentioned, we will be very selective. We are only going to invest in this segment in projects that we have an incredibly high confidence level in terms of not changing our risk profile but with offtake agreements with some of the best, most robust companies in the country. Michael Weinstein : Right. Understood. In fact, I think if I recall, you had previously said as being non cash taxpayer through 2019 now through the end of 2019. This is a slightly extended period, right? But you are going to be a noncash taxpayer? Gale Klappa : That's exactly correct. So as soon as we announced the last deal here, that moved us to 2020. Michael Weinstein : Okay. So I mean, the lack of the ability of these projects to avoid equity reduces, as long as they are not harming the credit rating or putting pressure on the balance sheet in any kind of way, are really at a lower cost of capital, right? Gale Klappa : That actually, in an interesting way, they are helpful to our FFO to debt calculation because of the bonus depreciation. Obviously, the cash comes back from these investments very, very quickly. Michael Weinstein : Right, understood. All right. Thank you very that much. Gale Klappa : Great. Thank you Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats so far on your Milwaukee Bucks. We will see. Season has got a long way to go. Gale Klappa : We just got the big dude from your Pelicans. Michael Lapides : You know what. Let's not go there. As a Grizzlies fan originally and turned into a Pelicans fan, I am just in depression land when it comes to the NBA right now. And I live in New York, which makes it even worse. Real quick, where do you think you are tracking for the next one or two years on your CapEx plan original target that you laid out around the EEI timeframe? Do you think you are tracking ahead? Do you think you are tracking in line? Do you think you are tracking below? And it's different than where you originally laid out. I know it's not been very long since you put that out there. But if it's different, where and how? Gale Klappa : No, I think it's a good question, Michael. And I think the honest answer is, we are exactly where we thought we would be in terms of the capital spending plan over the five-year period. We are on track. The projects we had identified for 2019, they are all underway. Again, remember we refreshed our capital plan back in October, November. Very little has changed. We are right on target where we want to be. Kevin? Scott? Scott Lauber : Probably the only one is our last announcement on the infrastructure which filled in our 2019 bucket. So we are going to be more selective as we go forward. Gale Klappa : Yes. But in terms of all of our regulated capital spending plans, right on target. Everything is exactly as we hope they would be. Michael Lapides : Got it. And another question. I know no one likes to litigate rate cases on earnings conference calls. But as we think about this year from a regulatory construct and past perspective, is there anything else to think about besides the Wisconsin rate cases? And do you see these rate cases as being significant items in the course of the company? Would you see these relative to historical trends or other companies in the state or the region as being kind of less urgent or less impactful relative to what you see elsewhere around the U.S.? Gale Klappa : Oh gosh. compared what we see elsewhere around the U.S., rate cases in Wisconsin are generally more genteel, if you will. And as we have said, we would expect the rate filings in Wisconsin this year and I will ask Kevin to comment in a second, the rate filings this year to be pretty modest in their asks. So I don't see a ton of drama surrounding these particular rate cases. Kevin? Kevin Fletcher : Gale, I would say you summed it very well. We are on the process of evaluating our rate case and our options now. And as you said, I think it would be in line with inflation and nothing major there. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated. Gale Klappa : You are welcome, Michael. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings Michael. How are you doing today? Michael Sullivan : I am doing great. How are guys all doing? Gale Klappa : We are doing well. Michael Sullivan : Great. Maybe just one quick follow-up to start on the rate case side of things. I just wanted to clarify the reason you are filing in Wisconsin is because you were required per the last settlement agreement? Or is there actually is a need would you have filed otherwise anyways? Gale Klappa : Well, to directly answer your question, there is a specific order point in the last rate agreement, the last rate settlement that requires us to file a rate case, I believe, by the April 2 of 2019. So there is a regulatory requirement. Would we have filed anyway? Maybe, maybe not. But clearly it will be a good time to really, I mean there a number of tweaks that we think will be helpful in terms of rate design, in terms of a number of other accounting issues, et cetera, et cetera. So I don't know that we wouldn't have filed anyway. But it really is a moot point in that there is an order requiring us to file by April. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then just a separate one on the O&M side of things, obviously, a pretty big driver again in 2018 for you all. Just curious how we should think about that maybe on a normalized percentage basis? And then maybe what you are targeting for this year on the cost cutting side? Gale Klappa : Sure. I would be happy to. Let me first explain the backdrop and that is in 2019, we will reap a full year worth of savings from the closure of the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. Remember, a large coal-fired plant of that kind requires very significant amount of annual operating and maintenance costs. Wisconsin Public Service closed the Pulliam Power Plant. There was a jointly owned unit called Edgewater, a jointly owned with other Wisconsin utilities that closed in the fall as well. And then we expect as and Kevin mentioned the new power supply, the RICE units that should go commercial in the spring of this year and that will allow us to retire the Presque Isle power plant up in the upper Peninsula of Michigan, way up north. You put all of those O&M savings together and we expect another leg down in operation and maintenance costs in 2019 compared to 2018. And Kevin, I am thinking in the 3% to 4% range. Kevin Fletcher : That's correct. Yes. The ballpark that we are looking at. Very similar to what we did this year. Gale Klappa : Fine. That's exactly it. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. I appreciate the color. Gale Klappa : You are welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. your next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Rock 'n roll, Vedula. Vedula Murti : Hi Gale. How are you? Gale Klappa : I am good. How are you doing? Vedula Murti : I am okay. Gale Klappa : Vedula, I always ask you that and I never get wonderful and award-winning. Vedula Murti : Okay. Wonderful and award-winning, aye. Gale Klappa : Excellent. Vedula Murti : Anyway. Let's see, a few things. One, if I am not mistaken, I think I saw something relating to the Illinois gas utilities with the main replacement program that you have been discussing and that the ICC staff may have some issues in terms of some investments or expenses that they have some questions about. Can you just kind of elaborate on that a little bit? Gale Klappa : Sure. I would be happy to, Vedula. The matter you are referring to relates to the capital investment that was made for the system modernization during calendar year 2015. And if you recall, our acquisition of Integrys, which included the Peoples Gas Company, took place, I think we closed on June 29, 2015. So as the Commission looks at retrospectively the prudency of the program and how it was run, how the investment program was run in 2015, remember we have the company for six months, the prior management had the company for six months. And essentially what the Commission staff is saying is that they don't think the program was run as efficiently as it should have been certainly prior to the acquisition. And that's what the issue is. So we will work our way through that. I am not overly alarmed. It's just a matter of getting through this particular process. And this is an annual review, which is part of the regulatory compact there. So it's something we are very familiar with. But it really relates to the 2015 investment in which we only had six months of operation of Peoples Gas. Vedula Murti : Does that mean that has 2016 and 2017 already been reviewed and has basically been resolved? Or is there going to be reviewed going forward? Gale Klappa : It will be reviewed in the future. Right now they are focused on 2015. Vedula Murti : Okay. Gale Klappa : But remember, Vedula, we have made very significant improvements in the management of that program. Vedula Murti : Okay. No, I understand that. My second question kind of ties to what Praful was asking about in terms of the uptick on the sales forecast. To the extent, I understand that it seems to tie into when you would expect a lot of Foxconn and all the ancillaries to basically be pretty much up and running or at a position where they are fully deployed or mature, whatever term you want to use. When I think look at my math, it was about roughly a little over $4 billion, I think, at that time of gross margin between Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, a 1.2% uptick versus underlying is about $40 million to $50 million in terms of gross margin or almost $0.10 a share compounding. So to the extent, just wondering about that potential variability of that sales forecast, given the leverage that it would show in the backend and as it ties into being able to continue the 5% to 7% that you have been able to do? Gale Klappa : Well, let me take a shot at that and I will also ask Scott to chime in and Kevin, if you have anything as well. First of all, let me reemphasize that the economic growth we are seeing, yes, Foxconn is a significant piece of it but it's a lot more than Foxconn. When you see the growth in the corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago, it is significant, with or without Foxconn. In fact, for example the polar vortex days we had here, just this last week, clearly are pointing to the need for some additional capital in that corridor just for natural gas consumption and reliability without Foxconn consuming one firm today. So my sense is, yes, we are ramping up just a bit our sales forecast for the outer years of the five-year plan. But recall that that will all get factored into rates. So I think you may be and Scott if you will comment on this, I think you may be thinking a little more granularly than you should be about the gross margin impact. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes, when you look at the volumes in that sales forecast, I think when we talked at EEI, these are the larger industrial customers that have come in, the Amazons, the Foxconns, the Haribos that the lower margin when you look at industrial classes, those are the lower margin classes. So the margin isn't quite there. But what we did put in the forecast is really put known projects out there. So we don't know where the additional jobs, that will be additional housing or the secondary suppliers. So we did not add that into the forecast whether it be the capital to put those in or the volumes associated with it. But the volumes here are really shown more in that industrial segment and I would expect in a few years after that would start seeing them in smaller groups, those volumes coming in. But it all does get worked into rate cases that allow us to continue to keep rates where they are at. Kevin Fletcher : Gale, I would just add that that certainly has been a growth part of our service territory and with that in any economic development project, like you mentioned the multiplier effect is going to be there. So that also is what's factored in as we look forward into the future. Vedula Murti : Go ahead. Gale Klappa : I am sorry. And Vedula, to Kevin's point, we have already seen two big announcements about healthcare facilities, hospitals and medical complexes being built within miles of the Foxconn campus. Just last week there was an announcement of a new hotel and a new distribution center and a new brew pub, by the way. So you know, you need to get out here. Vedula Murti : I will definitely do that in the summertime. One last thing. When you referred to the utility-scale solar, my recollection is that the new Governor is particularly interested in utility-scale solar as part of renewables and I presume that the filing that you are going to have asking for approval is simply step one of a more developed program going forward. I am wondering if you can tell us what your sense is how do you think that program was developed in terms of further utility-scale by rate base solar development? Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, as you know, one step at the time. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we should receive a Commission decision on the utility-scale solar projects that we have put in front of the Commission for approval. We expect a decision certainly by end of March or early April. Then as we have developed our internal plans, depending upon that approval and I am very optimistic about that, you could see us, as a next step, submitting a request for utility-scale solar for Wisconsin Electric as the one that's in front of the Commission today is for our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary based in Green Bay. And then I mentioned, we just received approval for a couple of pilot programs that are pretty sizable and it could bring up to 185 megawatts of additional wind and solar to our regulated portfolio. So one step at a time. Wisconsin Public Service approval, up and coming. We trust then we are going to work hard on these two pilot projects that the Commission approved before the end of last year. And, potentially, you will see a filing also for Wisconsin Electric for utility-scale solar. Vedula Murti : And those are reflected in the five-year forecast for capital and growth? Gale Klappa : That is absolutely right. Vedula Murti : Thank can very much. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Afternoon, Andrew. How are you? Andrew Weisel : Hi. Very good. Thank you. Just a few questions on the regulatory front to elaborate on your comments. You mentioned a little bit of the rate design and tariff things that you may want to reconsider with this upcoming rate case in addition to the revenue increase. Can you elaborate what specifically, as far as rate design, might you be looking to improve? And well, I will leave it there for now. What rate design issues are on your mind? Gale Klappa : I would just say, watch this space. We are obviously putting final touches together on our plans. But for example, there is a real-time pricing program that the Commission approved couple of years ago that has to get reviewed again. We think that's something that the Commission will take a hard look at and we will have some ideas. So that's one good example. And that's been a very popular program with our larger industrial customers. So that's just one example of a rate design type of an issue that we will have a good discussion with the Commission. But watch this space. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Fair enough. Then, any changes to the Commission you have seen? It's only not even halfway through February, but with the new Governor and potential changes to the Commission, the staff policies, mentality, anything that you foresee coming up in the rate case that might be a little different than the last few times you have gone through? Gale Klappa : Well, I think it's pretty clear what areas of emphasis we will be looking at in the rate case and the staff and the Commissioners would be looking at. I think my honest thought at this point is essentially steady as she goes. Andrew Weisel : Great. Then just last one. I am sorry? Gale Klappa : No. I was just asking Kevin or Scott if they had any other thoughts. Kevin Fletcher : No. I agree with that, Gale. Nothing else to add. Andrew Weisel : Good. Consistent with that will be a good thing in your state. My last question is you have been on a pretty steady two-year cycle for the rate cases as far as filings. Should we see the big pickup in demand with industrial and the trickle down to residential and commercial? Might there be opportunity to have less frequent rate cases? Or do you think this two-year cycle is going to be continuing for the foreseeable future? Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, remember, we have had a rate freeze for four years. So we really have, in some ways, deviated from the every other year rate case cycle. I will say, historically, the Commission has wanted all of the Wisconsin utilities to file a case every two years. Whether that approach is still something the Commission wants, we will have to see. Because obviously, we will have a new Chair of the Commission here by March and there is a new staff director, et cetera. So I would guess, though, because the Wisconsin Commission has been so consistent in it's approach over the years, I would guess that we probably will continue on an every two-year cycle. Andrew Weisel : Very good. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hi Paul. Paul Ridzon : Gale, how are you? Gale Klappa : We are great. How are you doing? Paul Ridzon : Just a quick clarification question. You said O&M should be down 3% to 4%. What's the normalized number to bake into that? Gale Klappa : Well, let's see. I think the day-to-day O&N that we manage, if I remember correctly and Scott, if I am off here, please correct me, that's because it's an easy number to remember, I think, for 2018, our day-to-day O&M expenses totaled $1,234 million, 1-2-3-4. So that's the base on which we are talking about to reduce maybe 3% to 4%. Scott, am I correct? Scott Lauber : Yes. You are exactly correct. And we break down the O&M when the 10-K comes out and we break it out into more detail there because there is other items that are regulatory in nature that are amortizations that come to the total number. So what Gale is quoting is that day-to-day O&M. Paul Ridzon : And I think earlier, can you just review some of the things you said were unusual in the 2018 O&M? Gale Klappa : Unusual in the 2018 O&M. Well, you have got to think about, there is some confusion about where tax repairs are impacting, that's a biggie. Scott Lauber : So when you look at the O&M in the earnings packet, you try a breakout how the tax repairs are pulled out of those ahead of it. I think what you are talking about is, we really only had a part of a year of our retirement of the one coal plant in 2018 and now the Pleasant Prairie Coal Plant will have a full year next year. And this year, in the second quarter, we expect that that coal plant in the upper Peninsula, Presque Isle, to close and there should be savings for that. So those are the two unique items we talked about earlier in the call. Paul Ridzon : There was nothing in sharing? Scott Lauber : The sharing is a separate line item, correct, the $67 million of sharing this year. Gale Klappa : Very significant customer benefit to come in 2019 because of the company's performance last year. Paul Ridzon : Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Thank you so much. Well, it looks like that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any questions, feel free to call Beth Straka, 414-221-4639. Thanks everybody. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2019 results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the opening quarter of 2019. First, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our Management Team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO of WEC Energy Group, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Guc, our Controller, Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Scott will discuss our financial results in detail a bit later in the call, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2019 earnings of $1.33 a share. Our performance was driven by colder than normal weather, the strong economy and a continuing focus on operating efficiency across our system of companies. I might add that our people and our technology performed exceptionally well during the polar vortex cold snap that grip the region during January. As wind chills in late January dropped to near 50 degrees below zero. Customer demand for natural gas hit new all-time records across our service areas in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. Our gas distribution networks were truly put to the test. And when it counted most we delivered. We've also made real progress on a number of other important initiatives during the quarter, we completed our new natural gas-fired power plants in Michigan's Upper Peninsula on-time and on-budget. With the new units online, we were able to retire our older, less efficient coal-fired plant at Presque Isle. And here in Wisconsin, we received approval from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for two major solar farms. These facilities will be among the largest solar installations in the Midwest and will support our effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining reliable and cost effective infrastructure. You can learn more about our generation reshaping plan in the climate report that we just published just this last week. In addition, our regulatory calendar is on track with rate filings in Wisconsin during the quarter. Kevin will provide you with an update on that front in just a moment. And as I mentioned earlier, we're benefiting from a thriving economy here in Wisconsin, the state's unemployment rate came in at 3% or less during each month of this year's first quarter. And new proposed investments are promising additional development and jobs. For example Global Healthcare from Fresenius Kabi recently announced that it will build a flagship facility for its U.S. distribution operations in the southeastern corner of our state. Closer to Milwaukee Foxconn plans to restart construction as planned after the winter break on Phase I of its high-tech, manufacturing and research campus in Racine County. Foxconn announced during the quarter, the centerpiece of Phase I will be a Gen 6 fabrication plant. That Gen 6 plant will produce liquid crystal display panels in various sizes up to perhaps 90 hedges. Production is expected to begin by the end of 2020. And in the matter of weeks, the Company plans to issue initial bid packages for about Gen 6 facility and for construction of the new data center as well as research and development labs. We\u2019re already seeing the positive ripple effect of Foxconn's commitment to Wisconsin. More than 30 additional investment projects have been announced in the vicinity of the Foxconn campus. Including hotels, medical centers and more than 2,700 housing units. These 30-plus projects should result in more than $900 million of new private capital investment. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for details on our operations and our regulatory calendar for 2019. Kevin, all yours. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by highlighting the work our employees are doing to provide excellent customer care and reliable service. Just last month, our WEC Energy Group companies placed in the top quartile in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for energy utilities. And as Gale mentioned, we're making progress across our Company is on key initiatives. I'll review where we stand in our four-state jurisdictions. Here in Wisconsin, we're now on track to add utility-scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets. You'll recall that on May 31 of last year, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations. Earlier this moth, Commission approved our proposal and we received a written order on April 18. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in the South Western part of state in Iowa County and will be developed and constructed by Invenergy. The Two Creek solar project is being developed and constructed by next era in Northeastern Wisconsin. Wisconsin Public Service will own a total of 200 megawatts, 100 megawatt at each site with an expected investment of approximately $260 million. We expect these projects to enter commercial service by the end of 2020. Now I'll touch on our rate filings. On March 28, we filed a proposal with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to set customer rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The request comes after a four-year base rate freeze, a freeze that has resulted in lower customer bills while maintaining world-class reliability and shaping a cleaner energy future. First, I'll discuss the request we making to set. We introduce customer\u2019s rates for electricity for 2020 and 2021. You can refer to the last two pages of the earnings packet for details on our natural gas and steam filings. Using savings from tax reform, we are targeting an increase in the typical monthly electric bill of approximately 2.9% in 2020 and an additional 2.9% in 2021. There are three primary cost drivers for our proposed we introduced electric increases. Number one, our transmission charges. Remember, the amounts collected in rates have been kept since 2010. Number two, revenue, the Commission assume that we introduced would receive from MISO starting in 2015 that was not received. And number three, increased cost associated with the agreement to purchase energy from the Point Beach Nuclear Plant. This agreement was approved by the Commission in 2007 when we sold Point Beach, and credited customers a total of $670 million over a three-year period. Now onto Wisconsin Public Service, the rate proposal includes our acquisition of approximately 60 megawatts of the Forward Wind Energy Center in 2018, as well as our investment in the two solar facilities. It also includes ongoing modernization of the electric system by upgrading and moving underground 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines. We've already seen higher reliability in Northern Wisconsin as a result of these upgrades. With the tax savings and other credits applied, the typical electric bill would increase by approximately 4.9% in 2020 and an additional 4.9% in 2021. Even with the increases Wisconsin Public Service average deals would remain well below the current state and national averages. To support our strong balance sheet, we are seeking a slightly higher equity component in these rate reviews consistent with Wisconsin Commission's prior decisions. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January of 2020. Turning to Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources has begun commercial operations of this new gas power generation stations on March 31. We've invested approximately $255 million in these new facilities. After the investment will be covered by a 20-year agreement with Cliffs Natural Resources and the other half will be covered in retail rates. This generation solution is expected to save customers nearly $600 million over the next 30 years. Looking to Illinois, the Peoples Gas system modernization program is roughly a quarter complete. As we improve safety and reliability, we continue to focus on efficiency and excellent customer care. Earlier this month, a national customer study found Peoples Gas to be one of the energy companies that's easier to do business with in America. And finally, an update on Minnesota Energy Resources. As you may remember from our last call, the Minnesota attorney general requested a review of the return on equity that the Public Utilities Commission had approved in December. The Commission has chosen not to take up this request, so our Minnesota ROE stands at 9.7%. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you very much. The Company continues to perform at a high level and as we look to the remainder of the year, we're on track to meet the upper end of our 2019 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance range is $3.48 a share to $3.52 a share and again we're guiding to the upper end. This translates to a growth rate between 6.1% and 7.3% of the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance. And finally a reminder about our dividend, as January meeting our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 a share. That's an increase of 6.8% over the previous rate. I hope this marks the 16th consecutive year that our shareholders will enjoy higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're in the middle of that range right now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now with details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here is our trusty CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our 2019, first quarter earnings of $1.33 per share increased $0.10 per share compared to the first quarter of 2018. Higher earnings were largely driven by the colder than normal winter weather. Additional capital investment and their continued emphasis on cost control also had favorable impact on earnings. Earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2019 and 2018 results. I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 8 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $542.8 million compared to operating income of $545.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $2.3 million. Adjusting for the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules, operating income actually increased by $2.4 million. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on Page 8 of the earnings packet, neither of these items impacted our net income. Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances, plan continues and our expectation remains at the transmission Escrow balance at Wisconsin Electric will be reduced to zero by the end of this year. In January, we adopted the new lease accounting standards, while it had no impact on our net income, it does affect our segment reporting. Two separate items affect year-over-year comparability. First, the presentation of our intercompany lease related to the power the future assets were impacted. The leases are fully eliminated in consolidation, however, the contracts are treated differently in 2019 across our business segments. The second item is a smaller purchase power agreement, which had an impact of approximately $1 million, reclassified between operating income and interest. We have adjusted of these items in a separate column on Page 8 of the earnings packet. By segment update we will focus on the remaining $2.4 million increase in operating income, which excludes the impact of tax repairs in the new lease accounting rules. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the increase in operating income, net of these adjustments was $5.6 million. Higher sales volumes drove a $20.7 million increase in margins. This was partially offset by $11.6 million negative fuel impact and a $7.7 million increase in depreciation expense. In Illinois, operating income decreased $9.7 million driven by a $16 million increase in operations and maintenance expense. This is due to higher weather related work repair, benefit costs and timing between quarters. Margins increased $11 million as a result of our continued investment in the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Operating income in our other state segments, increased $5.3 million driven by an increase in margin due to colder weather. Turning now to our Energy Infrastructure segment. Operating income in this segment was down $300,000, as expected Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind Farms did not have a material impact to operating income. However, a significant portion of the earnings for these facilities come in the form of production tax credits and are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits at approximately $0.02 per share. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment improved by $1.5 million. Combining these changes and excluding the impact of tax repairs and then new lease rules, operating income increased $2.4 million. Earnings from our investment to the American Transmission Company totaled $36.1 million, an increase of $3.3 million as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Higher earnings were driven by continued capital investment. Other income net increased by $23.4 million, driven by higher AFUDC related to the new generation Michigan's Upper Peninsula and an increase in investment gains associated with our benefit plans. Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense including in our operating segments. Excluding the impact of the new lease accounting, our net interest expense increased $16.8 million, primarily driven by our continued capital investment and slightly higher interest rates. Our consolidated income tax expense, net of tax repairs decreased $17.7 million. This was driven by wind production tax credits related to our recent acquisitions of the Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind generation facilities, in addition to various smaller tax items. We expect our effective income tax rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% this year. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, we expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a partial taxpayer in 2020. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings packet. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $158 million. The decrease was driven by higher working capital levels due to colder weather and tax reform refunds to customers. In the first quarter of 2018, we had not yet begun refunding amongst the customers related to tax reform. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $627 million for the first quarter of 2019, a $187 million increase from 2018. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and energy infrastructure business. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53% at the end of the first quarter, a decrease from the 53.4% at the end of 2018. Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group, 2007 subordinate notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We made $186.2 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2019, an increase of $12 million over the same period in 2018, which reflects the increase in the annualized dividend level that was effective in the first quarter. Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the first quarter of 2019, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 22,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year-ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volume are shown on a comparative basis on Page 10 of the earnings packet. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 7% versus the first quarter of 2018. This excludes gas used for power generation. Net gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.6% on a weather normal basis. Overall our retail deliveries of electricity excluding the iron ore mine, were up 0.5% from the first quarter of 2018 and on a weather normal basis, retail deliveries were down 0.4%. Finally, a quick reminder on earnings guidance. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.48 to $3.52 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal rather for the remainder of the year. Now looking at the guidance for the second quarter. In the second quarter last year, we earned $0.73 per share, which included approximately $0.04 from weather, taking the weather into account, we expect our second quarter 2019 earnings to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. This takes into account April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And just a brief side note, for those of you listening in from Boston, I just want to let you know, the Milwaukee Bucks are ready to rumble. So fear the beer folks. And operator, we're ready to open it up now for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Rock and Roll, Greg, how are you today? Gregory Gordon : I'll tell you tomorrow after the draft, okay, Gale. We need to\u2026 Gale Klappa : All right. Gregory Gordon : Just a few questions. And I can take this offline if Scott doesn't have this handy, but when you look at the investment gains and other income, net of the increased expense, overall do you know what the net contribution was off hand and if not, I'll take it offline? Gale Klappa : Scott? Scott Lauber : I think the investment gains was probably is the ballpark of about $15 million to $16 million, but remember those investment gains are really offset expenses that are up in the operating segments. So there kind of a \u2013 it's just really how we\u2019re reporting the information that are required to reported by segments down there, but it's really offset to the operating above. Kevin Fletcher : Yes, Greg, in the Scott's point you really have to look at the two different pieces together to really get a good picture\u2026 Gregory Gordon : That's why I asked. Yes. Kevin Fletcher : Okay, terrific. Thank you, Greg. What else was on your mind today? Gregory Gordon : I guess the second thing on my mind was taking into account the tax repairs agreement and the way you're flowing that through, how much have you reduced the regulatory asset balance that's impacting and what's the trajectory expected to look like? Kevin Fletcher : Well, considerably on the \u2013 and, Scott can fill us in as well. But the big one, the transmission escrow balance, which was over $200 million. We've more than cut that in half and we're expecting it to be zero. In terms of the remaining escrow balance by the end of 2019, it's a great story. Gregory Gordon : And then once that's at zero, does the agreement sort of complete or what happens then? Kevin Fletcher : Well, all of that will be decided in the rate case with new rates effective January 1 of 2020. Gregory Gordon : Perfect. Great. That's a great answer. And then forgive me if \u2013 I don't know the answer because I haven't read it thoroughly, but looking in the rate case, what are some of the other key second level things that you're looking to try to achieve. Are there any significant incremental changes in your generation portfolio that you're asking for in terms of deployment of new capital or retirement of incremental existing coal plants, and what are some of the big drivers there underneath the surface? Scott Lauber : Greg, I think Kevin covered the three big drivers in the Wisconsin Electric rate case in his prepared remarks. Couple of things that might be responsive to your question, first of all in the Wisconsin Public Service rate case, part of the driver for that rate case is really two renewable projects. One is the acquisition of a portion of the Forward Wind Energy Center that Kevin mentioned. And then the other would be included in our rate case would be the investment in the two new solar projects that we covered during the prepared remarks, the Two Creeks in the Badger Hollow Solar Projects. That's a pretty sizable investment, Kevin that would be a part of our rate ask at Wisconsin Public Service. Kevin Fletcher : And the other one that I would add, Gale, which I mentioned is our SMRP project, the renewable project where we under grounding a couple of thousand miles of overhead distribution to underground, we'll be looking to put that into our rate base as well. Scott Lauber : In addition, the low higher equity layer that we highlighted in there. That's about 1% and they've done it for other cases. And I'll just support our balance sheet better. Gale Klappa : Right. So we are asking for an increase in the upper end. We have a range now as you know for the equity layer, but the commission has approved, we're looking for a bit of an increase in the equity layer itself. And again, as Scott said, this has been approved in prior cases here in the state. I hope that helps, Greg. Gregory Gordon : It does. Thank you very much. Take care. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hi, Shahriar, how are today? Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Yes, it's not Friday yet. Gale Klappa : Okay. Shahriar Pourreza : So, Gale thanks for the sort of the updated around Foxconn. But maybe you could just touch a little bit about sort of the noise we are seeing in the headlines around the Governor and potentially looking to revise terms of the state contracts. I think you sort of highlights changes with the business plan hiring and this is obviously Gale, this is your baby \u2013 you're very close to the situation. How difficult would it be for the Governor to reopen the contract legislatively especially, but you've got a Republican-controlled legislature, is this just noise? How should we think about this? Gale Klappa : Well, great question, Shahriar. I appreciate it. Three observations to directly answer your question. First of all, we have now for the first time in almost a decade and Wisconsin divided government. So one can expect, I think a fair amount of rhetoric, newspaper headlines, political discussions that we haven't been overly used to over the course of the last decade. I would characterize much of that as just the normal back and forth in a divided government \u2013 in a political climate of a divided government. And my suggestion to all of you would be kind of ignore the rhetoric and look precisely and what's happening on the ground. Interestingly enough, as I mentioned during our prepared remarks, Foxconn is moving forward. It is now clearly define what they want to accomplish over the next 18 months in Phase I of the projects. It's significant, including the addition of a major data center. And as you recall, there still standing by their longer-term projection of creating 13,000 jobs. But to put a finer point on it, we have been as you know very conservative in our projections. If I don't think Scott had any significant ramp up in demand from the Foxconn campus until the last year of our five-year plan and we only had a very small amount of ripple effect, if you will \u2013 of additional economic development and additional jobs and additional demand. What we're seeing so far already as far surpassed in terms of the ripple effect what we have planned in our projections for the fifth year. So my view is kind of steady as you goes a lot of political talk let's focus on really what's happening on the ground. I hope that helps, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : No, it doesn't. And then I appreciate you addressing that because I know it's been a topic a little bit with investors. So I appreciate that. And then just, I know Gale, you've highlighted shifting to infrastructure you've highlighted more than a dozen sort of wind opportunities that are under evaluation very similar to the South Dakota deal with Google. It's you've hit 40% of your spending of \u2013 would you bucket it for about $1 billion. Are you seeing sort of enough opportunities that could be incremental to plan or as we're modeling this, should we just think about this is being more front end loaded growth? And then just secondarily to that question is trustee Scott said you guys are going to be in a tax position by 2020. But if some of these projects sort of hit fruition, how should we think about your current cash tax position post these projects? Gale Klappa : Well, Shahriar, we still have \u2013 great question. We still have a robust pipeline of projects that were doing a fair amount, as you can imagine of diligence on right now, it wouldn't surprise me in the least if you saw over the next four to six months another major announcement. So we still have plenty of opportunity here and as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks. Right now, we did nothing else. We would be a partial cash taxpayer in 2020. Another announcement would push us out into 2021. So we are continuing to work on basically filling that bucket in that segment that Infrastructure segment that you see in our five-year plan, and I'm very optimistic about it. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. That's great. And I'll echo Greg's comments around the draft, but with better New York Team. Thanks guys. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Shahriar. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Scott Lauber : Afternoon Michael, how are you doing today? Michael Weinstein : All right, doing good. Hey, on the wind tax credits, you notice that the operating income from the infrastructure businesses kind of flat for the year-over-year and understood the new projects aren't going to contribute that much that's understood. But with the new projects in service over the next year. How will that affect future quarters net operating income line. And just wanted to confirm that the tax credit line will \u2013 the $17 million increase should be persistent throughout the year, right? Gale Klappa : We will ask Scott to give you more detail. My view would be pretty much got to ignore in this instance you pretty much got to ignore the operating income line and look at where the earnings are flowing from and it's largely the production tax credits. Scott Lauber : Yes, that's exactly right. So the production tax credits, like I said it added about $0.02 to the wins when he looked at it. Now there's a few other items in net tax line for the settlement of the previous items and just some quarterly spreading that's required by the GAAP accounting that we planned in our forecast, but I think the key here is that $0.02 that we got that relates production to tax rate, that's about will get expect assuming normal wind. Michael Weinstein : Right. And also I mean we are hearing a lot about how it's been a pretty bad year for wind in general is that affected the projects at all or it affected the output, affected any of this or all just tax credit driven? Gale Klappa : Well, it would have I mean because these are production tax credits, the level of wind obviously is going to affect your income from the tax credits themselves. I will say though when we looked that \u2013 and we looked at pretty great detail, Kevin Scott and Rick Kuester and when we looked at the results of the first quarter and remember the Upstream Wind Farm was not in service during all of the first quarter, I think it came in second week of January, Scott, or third week of January? So we have Bishop Hill in service for the whole quarter and we had upstream in service for a portion of the quarter and we were very pleased. Overall, it was very close to budget. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And one last question for me is the weather versus normal. Can you provide any kind of impact versus normal instead of just year-over-year? Gale Klappa : Mike, you probably heard me say this a million times. The weather normalization techniques in our industry are just not very good. I mean, it's the best we've got but they're just not very good and looking at one quarter is really can really be misleading. So I'm not sure frankly as good as work is our folks do. I just don't believe the weather normalization numbers. I don't think our retail was down, but just think about one in fact, Kevin and I were talking about this just a few minutes ago, I think about one side impact of the polar vortex couple of days that we had. Well, most schools, many commercial businesses actually closed. So weather normalization can't possibly factor in that kind of extreme closure and so I'm not overly worried, in fact, I mean, we did see the huge spike in gas, obviously, and I would expect that. We are up in residential usage of electricity weather normal well everybody stayed home. So I wouldn't be overly concerned about one quarter and I still have, I think you have to look at a very long period of time to get any kind of normal results from our weather normalization effort. I don\u2019t know Kevin, if you've got any to add to that. Kevin Fletcher : I would agree with exactly what you said and not really anything to add so. Scott Lauber : So I think it's general weather was probably $0.04 to $0.05 just the pure weather effect that helped us in the quarter when you look at it by really Wisconsin has that weather because there's decoupling Illinois \u2013 has decoupling but between Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. It's probably about $0.04 to $0.05. Gale Klappa : The thing I'm most happy about is our system delivered, I mean, when you look at some of the shortages and some of the please for conservation when it was 50 degrees below zero with the Windchill I mean we really held up some other states did not. And I'm very pleased with how our company perform. Kevin Fletcher : Yes, I was going to say the same thing to if you look at just our neighboring states that was a request for conservation in that standpoint. We did extremely well, not only to our system but our employees as well, weathered through that the polar vortex very effectively. Very proud of that. Michael Weinstein : Great. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Gale Klappa : How are doing, Julien? Julien Dumoulin : Good, excellent, thank you. So perhaps the pickup on a slightly different thread, little bit tricky, but curious how do you think about settlement prospects here at this point. Clearly your peers in the state, we are pretty proud to getting something together. What are some of the important nuances to consider in a given case you've already kind of talked about the key capital items. What are the other variables when you think about it and obviously given this would be the inaugural effort to use the new legislation and any other considerations that we should just be aware of as we move through this for the first half? Gale Klappa : Well, good question, Julien. Let me just say this, we are very early in the process right now. I can imagine there would be any meaningful settlement discussions until after the staff completes its normal audit of our data and we're going through the garden variety, normal data responses right now in terms of just verifying their numbers, clarifying their questions on our numbers, etcetera. So when you say others did something in terms of settlements fairly early in the process maybe they were three, four, five months into the process, but it's simply Julien too early to tell. Obviously, we will have, what we hope will be productive discussions with the other parties in the case with the staff itself, but at this stage of the game is just way too early to tell. And again, I just wouldn't imagine any productive or meaningful discussions on settlement until after the normal audit is complete, and we're still going through the data requests as per normal schedule right now. Julien Dumoulin : Got it. All right, understood. And then moving back to state politics a little bit, can you explain a little bit of the back and forth and sort of your expectations for what is to come around. I would know and sort of intriguing back and forth between the courts and legislature is going on. As best you understand it? Gale Klappa : Sure. Well, I would just say this, obviously, we all would like the issues surrounding the Governor's appointments to be resolved as soon as possible. I think the encouraging thing here is the Wisconsin Supreme Court has now taken up the case, not just from the standpoint of whether or not a stay is appropriate, but they are taking up the case on its merits and the Wisconsin Supreme Court has already established a briefing and hearing schedule and my best guesstimate is that the Wisconsin Supreme Court will resolve this in the relatively near future. I'm guessing in the second quarter, early third quarter. So I think that's good news. Wisconsin Supreme Court now has this in this jurisdiction and they're taking it seriously and they've set a scheduled to move forward pretty expeditiously, Julien. Julien Dumoulin : And to be extra clear about this, is that would in theory depending on the outcome there could be an outcome that actually puts your back, back in the rule effective immediately. Gale Klappa : There are certainly could be up. Yes. Julien Dumoulin : Okay, excellent. Well, I will leave it there. Thank you all very much. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Julien. Appreciate your time. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hi, Gale. Hi, guys. Gale Klappa : Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides : Yes, sir. Gale Klappa : Michael, for Kevin's benefit, could you explain the difference between Miz and Beat? Michael Lapides : Miz is for all the Auburn fans on the line. What they're going to do when we think about the SEC title gain, Beat is what all of us, Alabama fans are going to do when we think about what happens in the third or fourth weekend of November every year. Gale Klappa : I am yours to take time, but I got that analogy. Thanks. Michael Lapides : I figured you would. I have an easy question for you guys, real quickly. Is there, when you're looking at your coal generation fleet, not only in the power the future units, but the rest of the fleet? Is there a given what's happened in both renewable costs and with natural gas and gas generation? Is there an opportunity in the next three to five years or so for you to retire incremental coal units and potentially save customers money as well as having an environmental impact and if so which potential units would you see as where the biggest opportunity for that could emerge? Gale Klappa : Even a Georgia Tech grant probably wouldn't answer that entire question, Michael. But certainly, I mean, we review our fleet on an ongoing basis. We look at our costs, we looked at the additional capital that might have to be put into these units to keep them running. Well, I think the short answer, Kevin that is there a potential opportunity over the next five years to retire additional coal units. I think the potential answer is, yes. We've done a lot already, Kevin. Kevin Fletcher : Well, as Gale is going to stay the same deal, if you look at what we've done since 2017, we retired 840 megawatts and we've done it based on the bay way in the criteria did you just mentioned. And as technology continues to change, we will continue that evaluation and assuming that things work out and the decisions that was made evident by our analysis, we would continue to look at it, but certainly do not have any specific ones that we're looking at right now that I want to talk about. Gale Klappa : And I will say Michael, to your question, we are already \u2013 remember we set a goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by the year 2030. We are now thinking based on what we've accomplished and what we're seeing that we may hit that goal by as early as the end of 2023 and seen that progress, we then set a longer-term goal of an 80% reduction by the year 2050. And if you have the time, I think just perusing our climate report that we just published might be helpful to you to kind of show you the various pathways that we think might work to get us to that 80% reduction, Michael. Scott Lauber : Our report shows different options and technologies that are needed to help us to advance to reach that 80% goal. Michael Lapides : No, and that was honestly one of the better versions of a report like that I've seen because unlike some of the others, it would be easy to understand and easy to make through. I just taken myself if you keep adding renewables and if the gas output and the state continues to rise, utilization rates or capacity factors. It will weigh on coal capacity factors and at some point you hit a tipping point where because it's a heavy fixed cost business meaning running a coal plant. That's just the economics don't work like they used to. And that's kind of what I was actually thinking about that report and going through it when I asked that question a little bit of, this is still a state that uses a lot of coal generation and just trying to think about how that will significantly change and one of the ways it does is clearly through the retirements and the other way it does is through asset additions of different fuel types, but those tend to be a little bit of a circular reference. Gale Klappa : Right, and Michael, one of the thought along those lines, that might be useful. You are correct, the economics are very different than they were even five years ago, but you still have to have and what we experienced in late January in the polar vortex is a great example of this. You still have to have a backbone system that you can dispatch to keep the lights on. In one of the things that was amazing to us is on the morning of the coldest day in January, remember I mentioned, wind chills near minus 50. In the Midwest based on MISO data, 6,000 megawatts of wind did not operate. It wasn't because it wasn't wind. It was because in some cases at minus 20, the designs of the steel towers are such that the units have to shut down. The wind turbines have to shut down. So this is a complicated complex subject in the lessons that Kevin and Scott and others, and I have learned from it is the idea of having a balanced portfolio, while continuing to improve your environmental performance is just \u2013 Kevin, is just essential. Kevin Fletcher : But as certainly as Gale and I'd like to correct the number as I spoke to a minute ago, I believe us at 800 megawatts of cold \u2013 units have been retired 1,840. So I have little misspoke there, but you're exactly right Gale and your summary that we have to have the balanced approach for the first conditions because we have to have the consistent and reliable energy at all times for our customers. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hi, Praful. How are you? Praful Mehta : Thank you so much. Good and thank you for all the Q&A. It's really appreciate all the color and input so far. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Praful Mehta : So I wanted to touch on the ripple effects point that you brought up, clearly, you're seeing a lot going on and maybe even more than what you originally kind of thought about. How would that fit in with the growth profile that you've kind of laid out longer-term? You clearly hitting the upper end of this year, but as you think about the five to seven and I guess some of this, you kind of addressed in previous questions as well, but wanted to get at how we should think about that range going forward and what are the pushes and pulls that could help us kind of triangulate what you kind of hit in the out years? Gale Klappa : Well, good question, and I think Scott and Kevin, please feel free to add your thoughts as well. I think the first two things that come to mind are we have obviously a very modest rate ask in front of the Wisconsin Commission for our two largest companies. So the outcome of that rate case obviously will have an impact going forward. We are very optimistic about it. And then secondly, remember that we have in place and I suspect that will stay in place an earnings sharing mechanism, such that customers get benefit if we earn above or allowed rate of return. So for now, Scott, I think probably our best advice might be think about our continuing a 5% to 7% growth range. Kevin Fletcher : Yes, absolutely and the other item will be watching closely as where the ROEs end up for our transmission assets \u2013 in transmission investment. Gale Klappa : Very good point. If you remember, Praful, the Regulatory Energy Commission has had a number of cases in front of it and is still deciding the ROE question what the appropriate band of ROE should be for transmission investments, really many of them in the past, these case has been around for almost five years and going forward as well. There I think we have been, I hope conservative in our future projections, but time will tell. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. That's very helpful. And then just in terms of the ask itself around the higher equity and the ROE, is the base case 5% to 7% based on the ask or is it based on somewhere in between, how should we think about depending on what the outcome is how that kind of fit into the 5% to 7%? Gale Klappa : Well, I think the honest answer to that is we just have to see the outcome. We have to see what type of additional investments, the commission is comfortable with us making. I think our plan is very solid. But a number of a significant amount of the rate asked is tied to the capital investments that we're planning to make like the solar farms for example. So it's like Ragu it's all in there. And but I continue to believe with any kind of a reasonable outcome of the rate case that we will continue to be able to deliver the kind of returns that you're costumed to us \u2013 if your costumed to is delivering and the customers will continue to see the kind of reliability we've been delivering. Kevin Fletcher : Gale now, just to add for my prepared remarks to the request for both Wisconsin Public Service and we introduced a very straightforward from that perspective, so from that then we should be okay as we move forward. Gale Klappa : I think so too, Kevin. Thank you. Hope that answers your question, Praful. Praful Mehta : It does, I appreciate that. And just one final thing, more broadly and this is more industry, just on the M&A side, there has been quite a quietening down at the corporate M&A level or kind of M&A in general around the conversations has that something, is that something that you've seen as well in terms of just more focused on the organic growth, clearly the stories are quite strong for a lot of companies like yourselves. Is there a reduce conversation around the M&A team or do you just think that it's just we don't hear about it? Gale Klappa : Well, I can only give you my perspective, I would say, to be candid with you. You haven't seen a lot of movement in M&A in the last 12 or 18 months. I think in part because many of the companies had to issue equity and don't have the balance sheets to make significant acquisitions. On the other hand, we have a strong balance sheet, but we would continue to apply the three criteria that you probably are very familiar with that we've applied to any kind of review of any potential acquisition and that's very simply threefold. Number one, we would have to believe after a lot of due diligence that we could make the acquisition accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Number two, that we would want it to be largely credit neutral, and by that we mean \u2013 we're not going to trash our balance sheet, simply to get bigger because acquisitions in our industry in my mind are all about getting better as well as bigger. So we wouldn't rush the balance sheet, would we take a small one notch downgrade for the right deal maybe would we take a full category downgrade, no. And then thirdly, we would want the organic growth rate of anything that we would acquire to be at least as strong as our own organic growth rate. I think if you apply those three criteria, first of all, not much meets those three criteria. But if you do apply those criteria and we will and do rigorously then I think if there was something that met those criteria, you actually be doing something both for your customers and your shareholders. Praful Mehta : That's very thoughtful and appreciate the diligence and the discipline around the M&A. Thank you for that. Gale Klappa : You're more than welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hi, Paul. How are you today? Paul Patterson : All right, how you doing? Gale Klappa : Good and fine. Paul Patterson : So just a quick follow-up on Julien\u2019s question on the Supreme Court proceeding, when do you guys expect to Supreme Court to act on the PSC issue. And if you are willing to \u2013 you guys have any sense as to how they might \u2013 have you guys handicapped how they might actually rule? Gale Klappa : Well, they have, as I said right now the Supreme Court just recently took up the case. They have set a briefing and hearing schedule. They have not set a timeframe for a final decision. But the speed with which they took up the case would indicate to us that and I'm guessing here but then the second quarter, early third quarter is when we might get a decision. My sense is they will act as quickly as a Supreme Court would normally act with a sense of urgency in this particular case. And no, we don't have any particular insight into how they will make a final decision, but again I think it's encouraging that the Supreme Court stepped in without being asked to say this is important enough to make a decision in a timely manner. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then what happens to know in the meantime, is you still \u2013 is you lot again entered the building or what? Gale Klappa : To my knowledge, she has been asked not to return to our office until all of this is resolved. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just with respect to Illinois, I guess this week, I think the Chicago City Council surpassed the resolution, I guess voicing some concern about the infrastructure planned obviously they don't have any direct authority over people's, but just in general I mean, any thoughts about that. I mean clearly there \u2013 it's pretty much the service territory of people. How should we think about that or do you \u2013 what would you say about that? Gale Klappa : Sure, couple of things, first of all, the City Council did not pass the resolution. It was a Committee of the City Council. Then it was simply \u2013 the hearing, which took place \u2013 I think yesterday, we had an opportunity to present the compelling facts behind this program. There were a significant number of labor and other groups they testified during open testimony maybe wrong word, but appeared and talk in the open mic period about the importance of this program. So I mean we are not overly concerned. There have been as you know, a number of articles in cranes and I hate to use the word fake news, but that's about what it is with cranes. But I think we've responded to those very well in the compelling piece here is just how important from a safety and efficiency standpoint this program is. And I think that message is beginning to carry the day. So we are not overly concerned it's business as usual. And we're doing this as quickly and as effectively as we possibly can. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Operator : And your last question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Vedula. Vedula Murti : Hi Gale, how are you? Gale Klappa : We are good. How you doing? Vedula Murti : I'm doing fine. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Good. Vedula Murti : A few things, when we are taking the look at the quarter-over-quarter changes and you've mentioned, particularly on the income tax expense line, the wind credits that were favorable by $17.7 million on Page 8 of the earnings packet. I guess I'm wondering if we were to think about this within your annual guidance of $3.48 to $3.52, the $17.7 million variance in 1Q. What would that end up being annualized at the end of the year? I'm just don't know \u2013 I doubt you can just take $17.7 times or something like that? Gale Klappa : If we could, you wouldn't be asking the question, Vedula. Vedula Murti : Yes, exactly. Kevin Fletcher : The tax line, it's pretty unique this quarter and a lot of it, we had factored already into our guidance all of it had basically factored into our guidance. The true wind piece as it relates to actual production was that $0.02, a little over $6.5 million. There's other items that relate to some accounting rules for some verification of miscellaneous various other items that pull through that line which I call a little unique in this first quarter. So you can take that and multiply by that. The true production tax credit that we anticipate is about $6 to $7 million a quarter going forward. Vedula Murti : I missed the very last part, $6 million to $7 million a quarter as opposed\u2026 Gale Klappa : All the production tax credits for our infrastructure wins. Kevin Fletcher : Yes. Vedula Murti : I want to make sure, thinking about this properly such that if I look at the same table and the same line item in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q in terms of the benefits. What is the run rate that under the purchases, the $3.48 to $3.52 if generally speaking with some type of range for that line item? Scott Lauber : And we are still comfortable. I guess the way to look at is, we're still comfortable with our overall effective tax rate is that 10.5% to 11.5%. I think that would be the best, you to put in your models, if you exclude the tax repairs in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s 20% to 21%. I think that's probably the best way to look at it, because those are still good as our forecast. Gale Klappa : There's a lot of ins and outs to Scott's point in that line. So I think Scott is right. If I were in your shoes, I would model the \u2013 what we say, we expect our effective tax rate to be for the year. Vedula Murti : But is it fair to say that this quarter in particular was somewhat elevated and concentrated as opposed to normal? Scott Lauber : Yes, I think it was somewhat elevated. I don't have the tax rate straight in front of me, I think it\u2019s in there. So our tax rate came in about 20.1%. So again, it\u2019s factored all and it is going to be a little higher, but it's particularly little higher than this quarter. So this is unique accounting and I think, the key is we look at the overall tax rate. Vedula Murti : Okay. In terms of the five-year capital plan, the energy infrastructure pile that\u2019s always been like maybe 9% or as I recall, or something like that. Gale Klappa : I think it\u2019s 11% in our five-year plan. Vedula Murti : Okay. Clearly you're running way ahead on a pro rata run rate and you alluded to the menu of prospects that you're looking at. Why is it not reasonable for us to expect that number that's currently within the five-year plan will end up having to be elevated at some point in time, either next year when you update CapEx or some other time in between now and then? Gale Klappa : Well, couple of things, first of all we have \u2013 as I mentioned a pretty robust pipeline of opportunity, but we also need to look at a number of other factors including our tax appetite. So we're being very particular and cherry picking only the very best projects that we think have really solid business cases behind them, really solid off-takers for all the win. So there are a number of factors here that we take a look at. The best projects, the tax appetite, essentially what other investment opportunities we might have. So I wouldn't, yes we're way ahead of schedule. We're pleased about that the projects, I think our first rate, but I wouldn't necessarily assume that we're going to blow the doors off just because we've had some early success here. At same time, I'm optimistic that we can fill up that portion of our capital plan with very high quality projects. Vedula Murti : Okay. And I guess maybe one last thing regarding Peoples Gas obviously Paul asked about some of the current \u2013 press and activity? Can you update us on the audit that is going on with regards to I think the period where I think it was partially pre your ownership and partially your ownership for the first year and where the status is of that. And then, when that's concluded then remind me how the next audit gets initiated in terms of review? Gale Klappa : Sure. But what you're referring to in terms of the current audit in the year end which we were partial owner for the second half of the year, that's the 2015 reconciliation audit that and I would just point out that under the way this program works. There is basically a reconciliation and audit review after the fact every year. So we can expect every year that the commission will exercise its proper oversight over how the program was managed in the prior year. It just so happens that 2015 is still outstanding there is now a proposed from the administrative law judge proposed resolution very modest amount of change that the administrative law recommending and again we weren't in that company for the first half of the year. So we didn't have an opportunity when we didn't own the company to make some of the improvements we've already made. But you can expect an annual audit as normal, that's just how the program works. And I think it's certainly appropriate for there to be an annual audit. Vedula Murti : So the 16 audit for full-year where \u2013 first full-year where you owned it, that will commence upon the completion of the current audit. Correct? Gale Klappa : I suspect that right, schedule as yet been set, but I suspect. That's right. Vedula Murti : Okay, thank you very much. And hey good luck for the bucks, okay. Gale Klappa : Go bucks, thank you Vedula. Vedula Murti : All right, thank you. Gale Klappa : All right, folks, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. It's always a blast. If you have any more information or questions free to contact Beth Straka, our direct line 414-221-4639. Thanks everybody. Good bye.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Second Quarter 2019 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode, at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our second quarter 2019 results. First as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now before we dive into our quarter, I'd like to take just a moment to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our field personnel and support staff in the wake of the most severe storms that hit Central and Northern Wisconsin in at least 20 years. On July 19 and 20, eight confirmed tornadoes wrecked havoc across the area, and literally tore apart portions of our system. Both Kevin and I want to thank Governor Evers and his staff, the National Guard and the local emergency management teams for their outstanding support and cooperation. This was a textbook example of the public and private sectors pulling together for the common good. And now, onto the quarter. Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a few minutes. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.74 a share. During the quarter, we continue to see the benefit of operating efficiencies across our system and the infrastructure investments we've made outside our traditional footprint also had a positive impact. These factors helped us to overcome an unusually cool start to summer in the Midwest. Turning now to our power generation portfolio in Wisconsin. As we look ahead, we've identified the need for additional capacity at We Energies, capacity that can deliver carbon-free energy. So, just last week we filed with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for approval to invest in the Badger Hollow II solar park, which will be located in the Southwestern part of the state. As you may recall, we've already received approval for Wisconsin Public Service to invest in Badger Hollow I. We expect this next phase of development of Badger Hollow to expand our solar capacity by approximately 100 megawatts. This investment will support our effort to reduce CO2 emissions and maintain reliable affordable service for our customers. In the meantime, we continue to see a very healthy economy here in Wisconsin. The unemployment rate for June came in at 2.9%. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has stood at 3% or lower since July of last year. This marks the longest period on record in the state with unemployment at or below 3%. And based on data just released literally last week, more people are working in the Milwaukee region that at any time in history. Also, we see continued momentum with a wide range of economic development projects. In May for example, site and operational plans were approved for Haribo\u2019s first North American plant. Haribo is moving forward here in Wisconsin and what will be one of America's largest confectionery plants. Groundbreaking is scheduled for Phase I of construction by spring 2020. At full build-out, the Haribo manufacturing campus can employ as many as 1,250 workers. So folks the gummy bears are coming Well, last quarter, I also mentioned that international healthcare firm Fresenius Kabi announced plans for a production facility in the region. Now Fresenius will be joined by another pharmaceutical company Nexus Pharmaceuticals. A few weeks ago, Nexus unveiled plans to develop a therapeutic drug manufacturing facility in multiple phases over the next 10 years. Nexus expects to invest $250 million in the project. First phase of commercial production is slated to begin in 2022. The decision by Nexus to invest here highlights our ongoing success in attracting companies that require skilled knowledge and production workers. And I know all of you are interested in an update on Foxconn. In June, Foxconn began pouring the footings and the concrete foundations for its Gen 6 LCD fabrication plant. Initial production is expected to begin late next year. Foxconn has also announced plans to diversify its Wisconsin output, potentially including servers, networking products and automotive controls, in addition to display panels for a range of industries, and a high capacity data center is being designed to support Foxconn's research activities as its campus expands in Wisconsin. This kind of growth in manufacturing in our region is spawning a very significant ripple effect, nearly $1 billion of additional private investment has already been announced in the vicinity of the Foxconn campus. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some key details on our operations and an update on our regulatory calendar. Kevin, all yours. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by reviewing where we stand in Wisconsin. As Gale mentioned, on July 19, more than 290,000 customers in our Wisconsin service area were impacted as winds in excess of 80 miles per hour caused extensive damage to our network. Despite very difficult conditions, we were able to restore service to nearly all customers within a week. We also appreciate the patience and support of our customers in the wake of this historic weather event. Now I'll fill in a few details on the solar investment Gale mentioned. Just last week, on August 1, We Energies partnered with Madison Gas and Electric in filing for approval to purchase an additional 150 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. We Energies would own 100 megawatts of the solar park with an estimated investment of $130 million. Subject to approval by the Wisconsin Commission, we expect the second phase of development at Badger Hollow to be completed by the end of 2021. Now an update on the rate review process. You may recall, on March 28, we filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The request follows a four-year freeze of base rates, a freeze that has resulted in lower customer bills, while maintaining world-class reliability. After applying savings from tax reform, we have filed for an increase in a typical We Energies monthly electric bill of approximately 2.9% in 2020, and an additional 2.9% in 2021. There are three primary cost drivers for our proposed We Energies electric increases. Number one, higher transmission charges. Remember the amounts collected in rates have been capped since 2010. Number 2, revenue the Commission assumed We Energies would receive from the Midwest grid operator that was not received. And number 3, increased cost associated with the agreement to purchase energy from the Point Beach nuclear plant. This agreement was approved by the Commission in 2007, when we sold Point Beach and credited customers a total of $670 million. Of course, there will also be discussion during the case about the recovery of the remaining investment balance at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant, which we retired last year. Moving to Wisconsin Public Service, our rate proposal includes our investment in the Forward Wind Energy Center and the two Wisconsin solar facilities. It also includes ongoing modernization of our electric system to improve reliability in Northeastern Wisconsin. With the tax savings and other credits applied, the typical Wisconsin Public Service Electric bill would increase by approximately 4.9% in 2020, and an additional 4.9% in 2021. Even with these increases, typical bills by Wisconsin Public Service customers would remain well below the current state and national averages. To support our strong balance sheet, we are seeking a slightly higher equity component in these rate reviews consistent with recent decisions made by Wisconsin Commission. We received a procedural schedule on the Commission on June 10. The first key date in the process is August 23, when Commission staff and intervenors will file their direct testimony. We expect a Commission decision in the fourth quarter for new rates effective January 1, 2020. Turning now to Illinois, the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program is progressing well. We just retired Chicago's oldest natural gas main, a cast iron pipe that was placed into service in 1859, before the Civil War. This long-term effort to provide Chicago with a safe modern natural gas delivery network is approximately 26% complete. On a final note, others are recognizing our focus on safety and reliability at Peoples Gas. Escalent, an analytics firm recently surveyed more than 50,000 residential customers across the country about their energy companies. Through this survey, Peoples Gas was ranked among the top 10 most trusted natural gas utility brands in the nation, and number one in the Midwest. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Thank you very much, Kevin. With our strong performance through the first half of this year, we are raising our 2019 full-year guidance to a range of $3.50 a share to $3.53 a share, the expectation of reaching the top-end of the range. This translates folks into a growth rate between 6.7% and 7.6% of the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance. And for the longer-term, we continue to project that our earnings per share will grow at a rate of 5% to 7% a year. And finally, a reminder about our dividend. In the January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.59 a share, increase of 6.8% over the previous rate. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Now with details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here is our CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our 2019 second quarter earnings grew $0.74 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our favorable results were largely driven by additional capital investment and our continued emphasis on cost control. Weather accounted for a $0.07 decrease in the quarter compared to last year. Compared to normal, weather is a $0.03 drag in the quarter. In fact, June was the 10th coolest in the past 70 years. The good news is the weather headwind was fully offset by fuel recovery, which was positive by approximately $0.02 per share and by additional O&M savings. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date results. My main focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 9 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2019 was $314.6 million compared to operating income of $330.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, a decrease of $16.2 million. Adjusting for the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules, operating income decreased by $6 million. Remember that in January, we adapted the new lease accounting standard, which had no impact on our net income but does affect our segment reporting. For your reference, we have a breakout of these items for both the second and the first six months of 2019 on Page 9 and 10 of the earnings packet. Neither of these items impacted our net income. Recall that as part of our previous rate settlement Wisconsin, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. The plan continues and our expectation remains that the transmission escrow balance that We Energies will be reduced to zero by the end of this year. My segment update will focus on the remaining $6 million decrease in operating income, which excludes the impact of tax repairs and the new lease accounting rules. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the decrease in operating income, net of these adjustments, was $1.7 million. Lower sales volume, primarily related to weather, drove a $34.8 million decrease in operating income, depreciation expense also increased by $8.4 million. This was substantially offset by $38.1 million reduction in operating and maintenance expense, largely driven by our plant retirements. Additionally, we saw a positive impact from fuel. In Illinois, operating income increased by $900,000. Margins rose as a result of our continued investments. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation and operating and maintenance expense. The higher expense was due to repair work related to a much colder than normal first quarter and higher benefit costs. Operating income in our Other State segment decreased $3.5 million. We saw a $2.5 million decrease in margin related to the timing of interim rates at our Minnesota utility in 2018. Turning now to our Energy Infrastructure segment, operating income at this segment was down $1.1 million. As expected, Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind investments did not have a material impact on operating income. However, a significant portion of earnings from these facilities come in the form of production tax credits and are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits added approximately $0.02 per share to our earnings for the quarter. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased by $600,000. Combining these changes and excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules, operating income decreased $6 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $36.9 million, an increase of $8.2 million as compared to the second quarter of 2018. Approximately, $5.2 million of the increase was driven by continued capital investment. The remainder was driven by 2018 charge related to the final resolution of a FERC audit. Other income net decreased by $7.8 million largely related to a prior year item, which was fully offset in operation and maintenance expense. There is no impact to quarterly net income. Additionally, a portion of the decrease was driven by lower investment gains associated with our benefit plans. Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense, including in our operating segments. Excluding the impact of the new lease guidance, our net interest expense increased by $14.7 million, primarily driven by our continued capital investment and slightly higher interest costs. Our consolidated income tax expense, net of tax repairs decreased by $24.8 million. The major factors were lower income before income taxes, production tax credits related to our infrastructure investments, and a 2018 tax reform item. We expect our effective income tax rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% this year. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, we expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a partial taxpayer in 2020. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings packet. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $222 million. The decrease was driven by tax reform refunds to customers and a higher working capital. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions grew $1.1 billion for the first half of 2019, a $130.8 million increase from the same period in 2018. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and energy infrastructure business. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53.2% at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from the 53.4% at the end of 2018. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinate notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $372.3 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2019, an increase of $23.6 million over the same period in 2018, which reflects the increase in the dividend level that was effective in the first quarter of this year. Turning now to sales, we continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the second quarter of 2019, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year-ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volume were shown on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings packet. Overall retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were down 2.7% compared to the first half of 2018 and on a weather normal basis, deliveries were down 1%. Excluding gas used for power generation, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.8% versus the first half of 2018. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2% on a weather normal basis. Again, this excludes gas used for power generation. Keep in mind that the weather in the second quarter of 2019 was dramatically different than the second quarter of 2018. As a result, We Energies experienced a 65% decrease in cooling degree days. I think it's important to point out that the dramatic swing really limits our effectiveness of our normalization calculations. Finally, a quick reminder on earnings guidance. As Gale mentioned, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance range to $3.50 to $3.53 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Now looking at the guidance for the third quarter. In the third quarter last year, we earned $0.74 per share, which included a $0.05 pickup from warmer than normal weather. We expect our third quarter 2019 earnings to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.71 per share. This takes into account the July weather in the expense from the recent storms. As usual, we are assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And for those of you who would like to learn more about our environmental and social performance, I'll direct you to our latest corporate responsibility report available on our website, which we published just last month. Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gregory Gordon : Good morning, Gale. Gale Klappa : Greg, how are you? Gregory Gordon : Hi, can't complain. So Gale, great quarter, considering the uncontrollable things that you had to manage, namely that the huge swing in the weather. And I think I understand exactly where the offsets were, but it's not 100% clear because of the \u2013 all the flow through impacts of the change in accounting for tax repairs. What were the two or three key items in the quarter that allowed you to effectively offset the headwind from weather this year and put you in a position to raise the guidance range, if you could just simplify for us? Gale Klappa : Sure. I'll be happy to take a shot at it. Will ask Scott or Kevin to add their view as well. To me, there were two big factors. I mean, there are many small factors, but two big ones. One, I mentioned continuing operating efficiency across our system. The second quarter of this year was really the first quarter, where we're seeing the full benefit of the retirement of our older, less efficient coal-fired power plants. Remember, over the course of the last year or so, we've retired three older coal-fired power plants, our Pleasant Prairie plant near the state line of \u2013 near Illinois, our Pulliam Plant near Green Bay, and the Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The closure of those three plants is delivering as we expected significant O&M cost reductions. So I think that was a big factor. The second is, again we expected it. But we're seeing the benefit of our infrastructure investments that we've made and that was a $0.02 a share pickup compared to last year, as we roll in more of these infrastructure investments. So those I think were two very big factors. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. And I think the third item, as sales were down a little bit. We saw the benefit in fuel by a $0.02 that came in a little bit better that offset. Remember the quarter was about $0.03 down compared to normal between the fuel and the O&M and infrastructure that all contributed to us getting above our original guidance. Gale Klappa : Greg, does that help? Gregory Gordon : Yes, it does. My second question is just you guys are really good in putting out some of your monthly slide deck updates on where the business stands. You don't do them specifically for the earnings calls, but I'm looking at slide 10 of the July investor presentation where you talk about the Badger Hollow Solar Farm and the Two Creeks Solar Project. So specifically what on the margin has improved there in terms of visibility on megawatts and dollars? And is that all accretive to the overall CapEx plan that you laid out in the presentation? Gale Klappa : Well, Greg, first of all, should point out those are regulated investments. So that's different from the infrastructure segment that we talk about. So these basically the Badger Hollow investments, the Badger Hollow I just in the quarter, we got approval from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to proceed with Badger Hollow I. That is capacity for Wisconsin Public Service in the Northern part of the state. And then as I mentioned on the call, we just filed a week ago for approval to invest in Badger Hollow II, which would be capacity for We Energies. In essence, the WPS, Wisconsin Public Service investment would be about $260 million because that also includes the Two Creeks Solar Farm in the northeastern part of the state. So about $260 million of solar investment for Wisconsin Public Service. Kevin, about $130 million of investment for We Energies. Kevin Fletcher : That's correct, Gale. As you said, the Badger Hollow and the Two Creeks were both for Wisconsin Public Service. Gale Klappa : And Greg, all of that was in our five-year plan. Gregory Gordon : Excellent. Thank you, Gale. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, guys. How are you doing? Gale Klappa : Good. I'm just thrilled to both you and Greg are working on the same day. I mean this is a red letter day for us. Shahriar Pourreza : We know that. That's the pinnacle of my career, I appreciate it. Gale, let me just touch a little bit on sort of the Energy Infrastructure segment. I know, can you comment on whether you're still seeing sort of robust interest around the wind investments? I know the last time you and I spoke, you were evaluating maybe a dozen or so sites. Maybe just a quick status there. And then Scott, with your cash tax status that you kind of highlighted around 2020. How does sort of some of these incremental investments around the infrastructure segment, could you see it pushing off of those cash tax\u2026? Gale Klappa : Okay. I'll tackle the first half. Will let Scott tackle the second half. First of all, yes, we continue to look at a range of projects for the Infrastructure segment. We are in heavy due diligence right now on a couple of projects. So we'll see where that turns, but again we're in heavy due diligence, kind of final stages of due diligence on a couple of projects right now. We do see continued opportunity there, and we're being incredibly selective because we can be. I mean, we're only going to pick what we think are the absolute cream of the crop. Right now, without any additional infrastructure investments, I expect some more to come, but without any Scott, we would be a partial tax cash payer. [indiscernible] next year. Scott Lauber : Yes, so in 2020 and then anything additional would help us continue to take advantage of our cash position at the end of 2020 and 2021. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And it seems like you guys are filling up this bucket, the $1.1 billion that's in your sort of your plan, somewhat ahead of schedule. Is that something you look to update at EEI? Gale Klappa : Well, we always update at EEI. We will have a whole refresh of our five-year capital plan \u2013 spinning out another year, it will probably introduce that on our earnings call next time and then go into great detail with you and everyone else who is interested at the EEI session. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And Gale, just I know, I probably ask you this on a weekly basis, but is there a point in time with the Foxconn project that you could, sort of given assessment on sort of the rooftop solar opportunities and just remind us if you do announce a rooftop solar project on Foxconn, is that incremental to sort of your plan? Gale Klappa : Well to answer the first part of your question, obviously, in the first quarter, Foxconn substantially reworked their Phase 1 development. Based on and they are going full bore now on Phase 1 construction. Kevin was telling me, he drove by there yesterday, and I mean it's, the construction is rocking on the Foxconn campus right now. So even though they've redone Phase 1 with the addition of a data center, which was not in their original Phase 1 plan, we don't see at the moment a lot of change in demand from Foxconn for Phase 1. So now that they are putting all the final designs in place for Phase 1, letting construction projects and letting construction contracts, we will be in a lot better position to talk with them about how we're going to meet their energy need. I think solar is still a possibility and we'll see where we go, but they really have not been in a position as they've redesigned Phase 1 to really talk about that kind of detail at this stage of the game. So our plan really didn't really identify specific solar project for Foxconn. So we would just see how \u2013 we'll see how all that shapes out. But I would expect by the end of this year, we'll have a much better feel for exactly how we're going to serve their need and I expect the Phase 1 needs still to be very significant [Audio Gap]. Shahriar Pourreza : \u2026in the quarter. Very helpful. Congrats again, guys. Gale Klappa : Thank you very much Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin : Hey, good afternoon. Gale Klappa : How are you, Julien? Julien Dumoulin : Excellent. Well, I'm just going to pick it up where Shar left it off a little bit, but on the infrastructure side of the equation and admittedly this little bit of a blend. When you think about the gas storage opportunity, I believe the first go around in Bluewater was about a third of your overall needs. How do you think about owning relative to just procuring relative to your total needs on storage? What are the frameworks, the metrics that you might think about in that debate, if you will? And then I've got a follow-up. Gale Klappa : Okay. Sure. Well, first of all, we would very much like from a strategy standpoint to own more storage. Again, they take volatility out for our retail customers. These would strictly be storage for our retail gas customers. And Bluewater is a great example. Bluewater is actually delivering better customer savings than we even thought it would. So certainly we would be interested in procuring more gas storage, but it has to be gas storage that fits our need, it has to be gas storage that on which we can earn a predictable reasonable rate of return. But again overall, we would like to own more gas storage. We'd love to get up to 65% or 70% of our expected retail customer peak demand to be able to be supplied out of storage, but slower she goes and we continue to look at various opportunities. But right now the nearest term opportunities for us in that Infrastructure segment have really been in wind. Julien Dumoulin : Absolutely, understood. And then perhaps related, if you can, I suppose there was a lot of conversation about the impact of last winter's extreme weather and low cold conditions. We saw recently out of Michigan some draft commentary. As a follow-up to last winter and certainly related to the gas storage conversation, what's the debate and conversation in Wisconsin both within your company and at the PSC? Gale Klappa : Well, a couple of things. First of all, I would say no debate at the PSC, and there is a reason for that. We came through the polar vortex event at the end of January. I mean it was tight, but we came through that event with incredible reliability for our customers. And Kevin and I are both very proud of that. That didn't happen in every Midwestern state. So the Commission asked for report every utility in Wisconsin on their performance during the polar vortex, and we got nothing but praise as I think we should have for the reliability that we delivered. However, whenever you have an event like that that distresses your system to the max. It shows you where weak points are and where you need additional capacity. One of the things I think Kevin will see as we update our five-year plan is the network particularly, our gas distribution network, particularly in the southeastern part of between Milwaukee and the State Line need some reinforcement. Kevin Fletcher : You said exactly correct, Gale. As you look at Foxconn, all the developments that we've talked about from an economic development perspective, and that's part of the state. We had already identified the need for additional gas capacity there. But with the polar vortex it showed us that the need that we had identified was certainly one that's something that we need to address very quickly, and we do have proposals before the Commission now for us to strengthen that particular gas infrastructure. Gale Klappa : And that's really important. I mean, if you think about Julien, the life and death situation of a day where it's minus 26 Fahrenheit with a minus 50 windchill this isn't something to fool around with. And I think one of the things I'm very pleased about is our Wisconsin Commission has always understood the need for reliability and they've always been very supportive of the kind of extensions and expansions that we show, we really need. Julien Dumoulin : To clarify that's just an acceleration of just your capital budget, and timing of getting the things? Gale Klappa : Well, we have identified a potential need, five, six, seven, eight years down the road, it's here. Julien Dumoulin : Okay. Excellent. Gale Klappa : Very good. Thank you, Julien. Julien Dumoulin : Thank you, guys. Cheers. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hey, Michael. How are you today? Michael Weinstein : I'm doing great. Hey Kevin, I'm just curious when you guys, when you were taking a look at Foxconn, are they still planning a glass facility with Corning that would draw significant gas demand? Is that still part of the plan there? Kevin Fletcher : That is not currently a part of their revised plan to my knowledge. Gale Klappa : I think Kevin is correct. That is not \u2013 part of the reason for that is their original plan have the Gen10.6 LCD fabrication plant, which produces very large-sized panels, glass panels and that would require an organization like Corning to be on-site. With the Gen 6 plant, the one that they're now building and construction is underway as we mentioned, produces much smaller panels for a range of industries but much smaller in size and doesn't require an on-site plant like Corning would deliver. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And separately, Scott In terms of infrastructure investments are you planning at some point to get into more some solar investments on that side of it? I mean, especially with the Safe Harbor window that will close at the end of the year, you might have to get some inventory in place at this point. Scott Lauber : Yes. When we look at the infrastructure investments right now, the ones that are readily available that we are looking at is in the wind side of the business. Not that we would look at solar, but the opportunities we're seeing is more in the wind. And the solar that we talked about in the call, that's all in the utility, and we are working to get all the tax benefits there. Gale Klappa : Mike, it\u2019s Gale. I'm sorry, to echo Scott's point, right now, the economy, we've looked at solar. In fact, we looked at the big solar opportunity six months ago or something like that for the infrastructure bucket. But when we compared the economics that project would have been available to us. When we looked at the economics, the wind projects that we're looking at for the Infrastructure segment actually had more enhanced returns. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Even with the Safe Harbor tax credit. Gale Klappa : Even with the Safe Harbor tax credit. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And one last question. Are you, I guess in terms of being on track for carbon reduction and de-carbonization over the long haul, just confirm that the PTC, Power the Future Plans if they can continue to operate over a long period of time without and you can still achieve your goals. I just want to make sure that that's true. Gale Klappa : Yes. In fact, just to put some numbers around it. Our original goal was a 40% reduction in CO2 by 2030. We've made tremendous progress and internally, Kevin and I think we're going to hit that goal by maybe 2023. Kevin Fletcher : That's correct. Gale Klappa : So we're ahead of target on the initial goal and then the longer-term goal is an 80% reduction by 2050. And we have a roadmap that's going to require some technology improvement to get to 80% by 2050, but we think we know how to do that and it would remain \u2013 and the Power the Future Plans remain operational. Michael Weinstein : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Gale Klappa : Hi, Michael. How are you doing? Michael Lapides : I'm okay, Gale. Thank you as always for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and start to the year, first half of the year. Gale Klappa : Thank you, sir. Michael Lapides : I have two questions for you guys. One, the cost savings that have been a big driver so far of year-to-date performance, how should we think about the read through that has for 2020 and beyond? And especially since a lot of that is for the coal plant retirements. That's my first question. My second one is an easy one, if I look at your CapEx plan in the July slide deck and I thought it was like page 31 or page 32 it showed by function, and by geography. It always tends to show a roll down starting in 2021 in the Wisconsin and Illinois distribution CapEx. And just curious, do you really see CapEx starting to come down that dramatically in kind of 2021, 2022 and 2023? Or is it simply because you just don't have line of sight of what the specific projects might be this far out to be able to kind of forecast out that far? Gale Klappa : I'll handle your \u2013 if you don't mind your second question first. And that's the traditional roll down that we see in years four and five or three, four and five in our five-year capital plan. And really I think the easiest, most honest answer to that is, we don't believe in giving you a five-year plan with a lot of white space in it. And clearly, our plans can change, demand can change, lots of stuff can change three, four and five years out. So we tend to show you in our five-year plan only what we really, really have mailed in terms of what we think is going to have to happen, particularly in the regulated side of the business over that five-year period. So I wouldn't put too much stock into the roll down. If you look back over the last \u2013 I guess I've been around here about 16 years. Scott's been here longer. If you look back at our five-year plans for over all those years, you'll probably see very much the same cadence. So I wouldn't put too much stock in that. Let me say this. We continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth for the longer-term. And we believe we have a long runway of capital projects that will support that earnings growth. Michael Lapides : Got it. And that first question about \u2013 yes, the O&M benefits due to the coal plant retirements. I guess I'm going to break this in to two questions. How much of the O&M savings have the coal plant retirements been for this year? And how should we think about whether that impacts 2020 and beyond in terms of your earnings power? Gale Klappa : All right. Let me give you two specific responses to that. First of all, our estimate of annual cost savings associated with the retirement of those three plants is approximately $100 million on an annual basis. I don't think we have in the room here the specific number for the savings for Q2, but we are on target to achieve \u2013 on an annual basis, the $100 million worth of savings. And then secondly, think about it this way, our operational day-to-day O&M starting this year, system-wide, it was about $1,234 billion and I thank Scott for giving me one, two, three, four. We said at the beginning of the year that we thought our O&M could come in 3% to 4%, that was our goal, 3% to 4% below that $1,234 billion for 2019. And Scott, how we are doing? Scott Lauber : We are right on target with that. So we are through the second quarter, I mean the first quarter is a little bit higher O&M, the second quarter is a little lower, but we're right on pace to get that 3% to 4% out and all these plant closings are factored into our Wisconsin rate filings, which is part of the reason we were able to sale for so many years. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then when you guys think about 2020 and beyond, how should we \u2013 like will you give guidance based off of the original 2019 midpoint? Will you give guidance based off of whatever the higher 2019 guidance level, you just provided on today's call? I'm just trying to think about what the baseline is going to be? Gale Klappa : For earnings growth projection, Michael? Michael Lapides : Yes. And I'm just thinking about the starting point, not necessarily the range or the ending point. Gale Klappa : Well, our historical approach has been to give you a new earnings per share range, so say in the beginning of 2020, we'll tell you what we think our earnings guidance is going to be in a pretty tight range for 2020 and then we will let you \u2013 we will show you what that is off 2019 earnings, but also will show you a growth rate of the midpoint of our original 2019 guidance. Michael Lapides : Got it, okay. I appreciate it guys. Thank you much. Thank you very much, Gale. Gale Klappa : You're welcome, Michael. Take care. Michael Lapides : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta : Thank you so much. Hi, guys. Gale Klappa : Hello, Praful. How are you, sir? Praful Mehta : Very good. Hi. So maybe on the Page 13 of the release package where you have the volume and load growth because when we look at that, I know you mentioned a little bit in your initial remarks as well. It seems like load growth was pretty low even when you look at normalized for weather? So I just wanted to understand what specifically about the weather makes you feel that the normalization process wasn't complete? And then secondly, how confident are you about load growth by the end of the year given Q1, Q2 performance? Gale Klappa : We're chuckling because you probably heard me say this a gazillion times. I will say it again. The weather normalization techniques that are available to our industry are simply flawed. They're just not that accurate. And Scott mentioned during his prepared remarks, a huge \u2013 I mean a dramatic swing between in weather conditions, between Q2 of this year and Q2 of a year-ago. Scott, you just might want to repeat a couple of those stats. Scott Lauber : Yes. So we are looking at for the month of June, it was the 10th coolest this last June in the last 70 years, and then 60% cooler compared to normal in the quarter. And the other thing that made it really challenging in Wisconsin here, it was extremely wet. So whenever you had a day that would get even above normal temperatures, it was cool. But even if you had a normal temperature, the next day you would expect the load to be there. It would rain and actually cool everything off. So it's really hard to normalize when you have intermediate rains during the month and I think this is one of the wettest Junes we had on record. So that made it very challenging, but we are very happy when you still look at our customer growth. We're seeing about 0.7% growth in new customers or overall customer count year-over-year and both the gas a little bit higher in the electric and a little bit higher on the gas, so still seeing a good customer growth come through. Gale Klappa : In fact to Scott's point, our customer growth, both on the electric and gas side of our businesses, it's actually a bit stronger in the first half of this year than it was even in the first half of last year. One other thought and actually Kevin and Scott and I were talking about this earlier today. When you look at particularly weather normalization for gas delivery, Q2 is just problematic to begin with because the volumes of gas deliveries are generally so low given that it's spring time and there's not a lot of heat required. I think we have to be very careful about putting too much stock in one quarter's weather normalization. Now longer-term and you asked a very good question. Longer-term, we have projected a bit of an uptick, particularly in electric demand in the 2021, 2022 timeframe and we're still quite confident of that because of all of these economic development projects that I mentioned earlier and more that I didn't have a chance to mention. I mean we have a very robust pipeline of industrial economic development and expansion projects that are coming on stream largely Scott in that 2021, 2022 timeframe. Scott Lauber : Yes, exactly right, Gale. And we just took a look at it as we are preparing specifically in those outer years and just coming on our hands, we found about 14 projects that were significant size that's going to get us to the growth we projected when we were at EEI last fall. So we'll be continuing to review our forecast but feel very good where we're at. Gale Klappa : Amazon is going to use even more robots in their brand new facility and that requires more electricity, Praful. Praful Mehta : Well that's great and great to hear the confidence on that. So I guess the second question was more on your rate review \u2013 the ongoing rate review. In terms of the \u2013 I guess, you mentioned that you have a request for a higher equity ratio apart from other factors that you've kind of talked about. Could you give us a sense for where that equity ratio is in terms of the ask versus what's currently in the plan, just so when we see the outcome we can compare against what you kind of had forecast in your plan as well? Scott Lauber : Yes. So what we looked at the equity ratio on \u2013 and it's a little bit different at all the companies, but basically the equity ratio was about it. Wisconsin, our We Energies is the largest subsidiary at 51% and we're moving that in the rate case to 52%, which when you look at our numbers and the effects of tax reform, it really, really helps with the cash flow and the benefits there. When we looked at our \u2013 in our guidance, we assuming what our current rates are, we will put our long five year plan together at the 51 an attempt to Wisconsin Electric and there's a lot of stuff that will go through the rate case, but we really looked at that 52% is not only more beneficial actually to the cash flow and the benefits we've been taking all the credit ratings at the utilities. Gale Klappa : And 52% equity ratio is very consistent with the last decision made for a major Wisconsin utility by the Wisconsin Commission, so nothing out of the ordinary here. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. So just to be clear, if you did get 52% that would be accretive to the current forecast of your growth? Gale Klappa : I don't think you can look at that in isolation. You've got to look at that \u2013 you've got to look at the revenue decision. You've got to look at the return on equity. So it's like Ragu, it's all in there. So I wouldn't try to isolate that and come to just that one item and come to a conclusion, Scott. Scott Lauber : No, I agree. There's a lot of factors. We always look at it with ROE and equity percentage in combination. So we get through the rate case that then we'll look at where we are by most likely, the first quarter of next year for our guidance. Gale Klappa : And I stand correctly, this is no Ragu, it's Prego. It is like Prego, isn't there? Praful Mehta : All right. Well, I really appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Thank you. Vedula? Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open. Vedula Murti : Good afternoon. Gale Klappa : Hi Vedula, how you doing? Vedula Murti : I am doing okay. Gale Klappa : Wait a minute. Not wonderful on award winning, Vedula? Vedula Murti : Okay, fine wonderful on award winning. Okay. Couple of things, you mentioned about the tax rate and that you expect it to be 10% to 11% of balance of the rest of this year. Should we be thinking for the forward years 2020 and 2021 that with the some of the projects you have in the pipeline and whatever that the effective tax rate would be in a similar zone? Scott Lauber : No, I think when you look at the effective tax rate, you have to take out the tax repairs, and put it closer to that 20% and 21%. Tax repairs are really unique for our Company in 2018 and 2019. So we haven't come out with the range and the production tax credits will of course \u2013 will help us, but that 20% to 21% is a good reasonable number. Vedula Murti : Okay. And then I guess within say, your $3.53 upper end for this year, how should I think about what the earnings contribution tax credits are from here from wind production on other types of things as part of that aggregate? Gale Klappa : Vedula, we're expecting in terms of the impact of the tax credits from our infrastructure investments. We're expecting about $0.02 a quarter of earnings. And that's exactly what we delivered this quarter. Vedula Murti : Okay. So in terms of the forecast going forward on the 5% to 7%, tax rates kind of normalize back towards the 20% area versus the 10% this year. That clearly is already accounted for in terms of that lack of better term headwind, which will be filled in through other investments and rate recoveries et cetera? Scott Lauber : It is accounted for \u2013 in our growth projections, but it all gets some reset in this rate case here, because it's really a unique Wisconsin item that kept reduce that transmission balance to zero now by the end of the year. So those unique tax repair items will all get we said in this rate case to get back to that 20% to 21%. Vedula Murti : Okay. Gale Klappa : And again, because the use of the tax repairs during this year is to get that transmission escrow balance down to zero. Once it's down to zero, and as Scott said it gets reset or rates that are effective January 2020. Vedula Murti : All right, thank you very much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Gale Klappa : All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating. It's always good to be with you. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka, her direct line 414-221-4639. So long everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Third Quarter 2019 Results. Today's call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]. Before the conference call begins, I'll remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2019 results. First, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I'm also pleased to introduce Tony Reese, our new Treasurer. Tony joined our finance group back in 2006 and most recently, he served as the Controller for our Illinois utilities. Welcome, Tony. Anthony Reese : Thanks, Gale. Gale Klappa : Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter of $0.74 a share. During the quarter, we continued our focus on financial discipline and operating efficiency. That focus, which is embedded deeply in our culture, helped us to deliver solid results despite severe July storms that caused extensive damage to our system. Rebuild, repair and recovery from 9 tornadoes and 120-mile an hour straight-line winds resulted in a drag of the $0.03 a share for the quarter. Also during the summer quarter, temperatures were slightly above normal but milder than the third quarter last year.  So when you shake it up and put it altogether, we're pleased with the consistency of the company's financial and operating performance. Scott will provide you with more details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a quick look at the economic conditions here in Wisconsin. Unemployment remains at or near record lows of the state, and we continue to see positive news on the economic development front as well. For example, Foxconn announced plans to begin construction on its high-performance computing center later this year as it builds out Phase 1 of its advanced manufacturing campus south of Milwaukee where it also continues on Foxconn's Gen 6 fabrication plant. Crews began installing the roof on the nearly 1 million square foot facility last month. As you may know this will be the first LCD display plant to be built in North America. Then we saw another positive announcement just a few days ago. Molson Coors, the beverage company, confirmed it will base its major support functions, including finance, IT, legal and human resources here in Milwaukee. You can hear more about the economic growth in our region when you join us at the EEI conference next week. And more growth is on the horizon for our company as well. In the earnings packet we released this morning, you will find a snapshot of our capital plan for the 5-year period 2020 through 2024. We expect to invest $15 billion in infrastructure projects during the next 5 years. This represents an increase of $900 million or 6.3% over our current 5-year plan. Now folks, we've identified 3 key areas for increased investment. First, we plan to expand our regulated natural gas infrastructure to meet growing customer demand. In particular, Wisconsin needs more natural gas peaking capacity at the highest demand times on the coldest days. This became especially clear during the polar vortex event back in January when the windshields dropped to near 50 degrees below 0. To address the demand, we plan to develop 2 liquefied natural gas facilities in our service area. In fact just last week, our We Energies subsidiary filed an application to the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for approval to build the LNG facilities. We believe these projects are the most cost-effective way to serve our customers natural gas needs during the winter peak. Building LNG plants will differ costly and lengthy projects to expand pipeline capacity into the state. We're also increasing our 5-year spending target for our electric distribution network across Wisconsin. As you know, we consistently been named the most reliable utility in the Midwest. But to maintain the high levels of service that our customers deserve and expect, we need to replace aging poles, aging transformers and modernize hundreds of miles of overhead and underground lines.  And finally, we plan to deploy additional capital in our energy infrastructure business outside of our traditional footprint. We see excellent opportunities to leverage our tax position and continue to optimize our earnings growth. We expect this segment of our business to grow to approximately 6% of our total asset base by the end of the 5-year period.  Overall, our new capital plan should grow our asset base by 7% annually over the 5-year period, and I would emphasize this with no need to issue additional equity. And the investment plan continues to support our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. This projection comes off a new base of $3.50 a share, and that's the midpoint of our original 2019 guidance. We look forward to sharing more details with you at the upcoming EEI conference. And now I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on our regulatory calendar and more details on our operations. Kevin, all yours. Joseph Fletcher : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by reviewing where we stand in Wisconsin. First, an update on the rate review process. If you recall, in March of this year, we filed a proposal to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates that we introduced on Wisconsin Public Service. This August, we entered into settlement agreements with the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Clean Wisconsin. Hearings concluded in October, and I'm pleased to say that we received a unanimous decision from the commission approving the settlement agreements just last week. Rate design will be determined by the commission in mid-November, and we expect the written order in December with new rates effective January 1. Now turning to our solar projects. You may recall that in Wisconsin, we have a total of 300 megawatts of utility-scale solar capacity plant. We've broken ground on 2 solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, Two Creeks and Badger Hollow I. As a reminder, these projects will be the first utility scale solar facilities in Wisconsin. Our share will total 200 megawatts with an investment of approximately $260 million. We expect both projects to begin producing energy by the end of next year. We also have plans for more renewable generation at We Energies. This past August, we filed with the Public Service Commission for approval to acquire 100 megawatts of capacity at the Badger Hollow II solar park. The projected investment would be $130 million, and we expect to receive the commission's decision in spring of 2020. Meanwhile, on the natural gas side of our business, we're taking steps to maintain reliable and affordable service for our customers. As Gale mentioned, We Energies just filed an application to construct 2 liquefied natural gas facilities here in Wisconsin. We expect to invest approximately $370 million in these projects. We are now evaluating site plans and, subject to approval, we would begin construction in the summer of 2021. Turning to Illinois. Our People's Gas subsidiary continues to modernize Chicago's natural gas system. This program is critical to the long-term safety and reliability in America's third-largest city. As we replace the cities aging iron pipes and facilities, we are following rigorous protocols to keep our employees and the public safe. The program will be approximately 28% complete by year-end and has created more than 2,000 jobs so far.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you. Now folks, considering our strong performance so far this year, we're tightening our 2019 full year guidance to a range of $3.51 a share to $3.53 a share with an expectation of hitting the top of the range. This translates to a growth rate between 7% and 7.6% of the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance.  And now for a quick reminder about our dividend. As usual, our board will assess our dividend plans for next year in our scheduled meeting in early December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.  And now, with details on the third quarter results and our outlook for the future, here's our CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our third quarter earnings of $0.74 per share were level with last year's results. We benefited from additional capital investment, reduction tax credits and a continued emphasis on cost control. However, as Gale mentioned, July's severe weather significantly impacted portions of our electric system. We estimate that the storm restoration expenses resulted in a $0.03 hit in the quarter. In addition, comparatively mild temperatures accounted for a $0.02 drag in the quarter, and we did not book any sharing in our Wisconsin companies in 2019. We posted the earnings packet to our website this morning, and it includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date results. I plan to focus on the quarter beginning with operating income and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 9 of the earnings packet. We reported $310.9 million in consolidated operating income for the quarter. This compares to $302.7 million in 2018, reflecting an increase of $8.2 million. Adjusting for the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules, operating income was flat quarter-over-quarter.  Recall that as part of our previous rate settlement in Wisconsin, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset. That plan continues through year-end, and our expectation remains that the transmission escrow balance at We Energies will be reduced to 0 by the end of this year. My update will focus on changes in operating income by segment, excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease accounting rules. Starting with the Wisconsin segment. Operating income decreased $5.6 million net of these adjustments. Lower sales volume due in part to less favorable weather resulted in a $22.4 million decrease in operating income. Depreciation expense increased by $9.7 million. These items were substantially offset by a $23.5 million reduction in operating and maintenance expense. This was largely driven by a couple of items. Recall that the July storm resulted in a $12 million drag on the quarter. However, we have recognized about a $20 million cost reduction driven in part by our recent plant closings. In addition, last year, we accrued $15 million in the third quarter of earnings sharing mechanism we have in place at our Wisconsin utilities. No sharing was recorded this quarter. In Illinois, operating income increased by $9.3 million as a result of our continued investment in the safety and reliability of the People's Gas System. Operating income at our Other States segment increased $3.2 million driven by higher volumes related to customer growth in capital investment in gas utility infrastructure. Turning now to our energy infrastructure segment. Operating income at this segment was down $1.3 million. As expected, the Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind farm did not have a material impact on operating income. However, recall that a portion of earnings from these facilities come in the form of production tax credits, which are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits added approximately $0.02 per share to our earnings for the quarter. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased by $5.6 million. The variance reflects a $5.3 million gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2018 related to the sale of a legacy business. Combining these variances and excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules, consolidated operating income was unchanged. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.7 million, an increase of $5 million as compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase was driven by a ATC's continued capital investment.  Other income net decreased by $4.3 million as a result of lower investment gains associated with our benefit plans. Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expenses included in our operating segments. Our net interest expense increased by $13 million, primarily due to higher long-term that balances to fund capital investment. This excludes the impact of the new lease accounting guidance. Our consolidated income tax expense, net of tax repairs, decreased by $13.1 million. Drivers include production tax credits related to our infrastructure wind investments and the 2018 tax reform item. We expect our effective income tax rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% this year. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, we expect our 2019 effective tax rate would be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a partial taxpayer in 2020. Our projection show that we should be able to continue to efficiently utilize our tax position with our updated capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings packet. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $167.5 million. The decrease was largely driven by higher working capital balances. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.8 billion for the first 9 months of 2019, a $68.6 million increase from the same period in 2018. This reflects our continued investment focus on our regulated utility and energy infrastructure businesses. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53.8% at the end of the third quarter compared to 53.4% at the end of 2018. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinated notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $558.4 million in common dividends during the first 9 months of 2019, an increase of $35.4 million over the same period in 2018. This reflects the 6.8% increase in the dividend level that was effective in the first quarter of this year. Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the third quarter 2019, our utilities were serving approximately 10,000 more electric and 21,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings packet. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 3.2% compared to the first 9 months of 2018. And on a weather-normal basis, deliveries were down 1.8%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 2.7% versus the first 9 months of 2018. Natural gas and deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 1.3% on a weather-normalized basis. And this excludes use for power generation. Finally, a quick reminder on earnings guidance. As Gale mentioned, we are tightening our full year earnings guidance to $3.51 to $3.53 per share with an expectation of reaching the top of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.  And with that, I turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Thanks, Scott. Thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for some jive talking, better known as the question-and-answer portion of our call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Gregory Gordon : I have two actual real questions now. The first is, your weather normal sales growth is down. It's not a terrible number, but it is couple hundred basis points off of what you're assuming your longer term, economic normal economic growth forecast is going to be. Can you chuck that up to the near-term uncertainty with regard to the trade issues or other factors that are also weighing on sales? Gale Klappa : Good question, Greg. I think the biggest factor is clearly is the decline that we saw in the industrial energy consumption. I may have mentioned that to you on our previous call that about 20% to 25% of all the industrial production that takes place among the various industries across Wisconsin is designed for export. So if you look at economic conditions in Europe, the trade tensions with China, I think you see those as the reasons why we're down in terms of industrial sales. Having looked, though, Scott and Kevin and I just looked at the latest data thinking that you might ask this question actually, and while we're down in the last quarter or the last few weeks, we're roughly 4.5% to 5% compared to a year ago. The various industries seemed to have stabilized at that level. So we're not seeing any further deterioration as we enter Q4, but I really think what's going on is an industrial pause associated with the trade war tensions and with the soft economy in Europe. I would remind everybody, though, that our margins from industrial energy use particularly those customers that are on the real time pricing, our margins are very slim. So a slight downturn or even a 4.5% or 5% downturn in industrial demand does not translate into a major earnings hit at this stage of the game. Gregory Gordon : Okay. Thanks. My second question is on the capital plan, up from $14.1 billion to $15 billion, and the energy infrastructure component is also up. But it's up a little bit more on a percentage basis than the overall increase. I think your infrastructure spend as a percentage of the $14 billion was around 10%. Your infrastructure spend as a portion of the $15 billion is closer to 12%. Not a big increase but where are you seeing those opportunities? And do you still think that the risk profile at that level of capital spending is commensurate with what you're doing in the core utilities? Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, Greg, I thought we're going to let Shar ask all the multiple questions. Gregory Gordon : Got me. You got me. Gale Klappa : Shar will be back here in a moment, I'm sure. Yes, we saw -- you're seeing in the new 5-year plan a slight uptick in the percentage of capital spend going to our energy infrastructure business outside of our footprint. Two reasons driving that. One, again, we're looking and seeing a significant number of really good projects that fit our risk profile. And when I say fit our risk profile, meaning high-quality projects with high-quality, long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy customers, number one. And number two, this level, as we continue to refine our projections, this level of spending not only meets the kind of opportunities we think we have, but don't change our risk profile, but also maximizes our tax position. So we think that this is a really good deployment of our capital. Operator : Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Just real quick on -- two quick questions here. First, on the utility side. We did see one of your Wisconsin peers propose a 1-gigawatt solar proposal by '23. I'm kind of curious, like you guys are doing Badger Hollow, you're doing Two Creeks. How do we sort of think about sort of incremental opportunities here especially since your generation CapEx looks like it modestly decreased in your new plan, and the governor's obviously can't afford this. So I'm kind of curious on how you're thinking about that. Gale Klappa : I'll give you my take on it. We'll also ask Kevin to give you his view on this well. First of all, as you know, our generation planning really tracks what we think our capacity needs really are. So at the moment, we've got 200 megawatts of solar already approved. Then for our We Energies subsidiary, we just went in for another 100-megawatt approval, what we call Badger Hollow II, which should be immediately adjacent obviously to Badger Hollow I. So absent retirements of additional other generating capacity, that type of solar investment fits our capacity need, which is really, Kevin, a peaking right now. Now having said that, the governor has formed a task force related to trying to figure out what is the most cost-effective way to get to net zero-carbon generation by 2050. I'm pleased that the governor has asked our company to be a member of the task force. And we'll see where we'll go in terms of if there's any acceleration coming out of the task force. Kevin, any other thoughts? Joseph Fletcher : Gale, I'll just add, as you mentioned the governor has announced his plan and I've had an opportunity, and some of our folks, to talk about his plan. And I'll tell you he's comfortable with where we are and what we've laid out. As you said, we've retired, well, since 2014 about 40-plus percent of coal-fired plants. As you mentioned, the solar capacity meets our peaking needs for now. But we're starting to take a look at what our peers are doing as time moves on. But I feel good about where we're at and what we've announced so far. Gale Klappa : Amen. Shahriar Pourreza : Good. That's perfect. And then just on your remaining coal assets. Obviously the PFC that we've sounded pretty cautious around kind of approving the partial securitization at Pleasant Prairie. Any sort of thoughts or guidance on how we should think about the balance of your fleet as we look at sort of the generation transition, i.e., was sort of the securitization a one-off? Or was it to be assumed that could be a template as we move forward? Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, Shar, I guess, we read the reaction of the commission and the discussion of the commissioners. The securitization of $100 million of our remaining book balance at Pleasant Prairie, we read that all differently than what you may have read it. In fact my sense is, from their conversation and from the feedback we've gotten from staff that they thought this is a very positive solution that worked in this instance. I think that the -- perhaps the one note of caution that you might have picked up on is that I think everyone of the commissioners said publicly that these works, and this was a good solution for this particular situation, the retirement of that particular plant. But they were open to whether or not this is a template, and they weren't saying by being positive about this approach this time that it was necessarily a template. But I think, overall, in the settlement and the process I think was very well received by all of our stakeholders. In terms of going forward, we don't have any plan to retire any additional capacity in the next 12 months or during 2020. But obviously, we continue to look at our portfolio, look at the demand, look at economics, and see where we're at. But right now, for the next 1.5 years or so, we're going to be focused on getting that solar capacity in and operating well. Joseph Fletcher : And I would just add to, that as we look at the decisions, moving forward on what the right generation mix is for us, as you mentioned in your comments, we don't have to look far back. In January, we had our polar vortex. We had extremely cold weather. And the balance of having a mix portfolio of generation, including the coal assets, was something that we needed to keep people's lives on and keep the gas flowing. So in addition to the economics and from a technological standpoint making the decisions, we'll balance that into our decision-making also as we move forward. Gale Klappa : Yes, Kevin. And Shar, that's a great point. And truth of the matter is, if we haven't had the full array of capacity, solar, wind, natural gas, coal and nuclear, if we haven't had that full complement of capacity back at the end of January, it would have been a life-and-death situation. So there's nothing to fool around with. But obviously, we'll continue to refine our plans. We'll continue to look at what makes the most economic sense. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Two quick points, if I can. Your peers regionally in the MISO footprint have generally been revising upwards there, sort of, 5-year CapEx outlooks. Can you comment if there's anything specific in the ATC context? Obviously, the MVP stuff rolling off still, so there could be some discrete items there. How do you think about that rolling into the longer term? And then separately, if I get the second part in here now, on the infrastructure bucket, I think I heard that you largely are not a cash taxpayer through the forecast period. And I presume that's tied to the infrastructure spend. How do you think about your ability to continue scaling infrastructure through the forecast period, given what I presume to be, largely tax producing assets that you're going to be investing in? Or tax [indiscernible] assets. Gale Klappa : All right. Great. Great questions, Julien. If you don't mind, I'll tackle your second question first, on the tax position. What we wanted to say and should clarify for you is that today, if we don't have any more infrastructure investment coming, then we would be a partial cash taxpayer in 2020. However, with the infrastructure plan that we've laid out in our new 5-year capital budget, we expect that will optimize our tax position and allow us to efficiently add additional tax credit related capacity in that infrastructure segment and maximize our tax position. Scott, am I... Scott Lauber : No. That's exactly correct. We will be a cash taxpayer in the future. And the 1.8 just helps us that we're going to utilize that efficiently and we can make those purchases. Gale Klappa : In essence, this -- what we have put in the capital budget for the next 5 years essentially effectively takes advantage of our cash tax position and allows us to take full advantage of the production tax credits that would be available to us with the additional investments. I hope that clarifies that for you, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed. And the former? Gale Klappa : Yes. How about tell me again? I was so focused on your tax question that how about roll out that first question by us again? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So with respect to your peers on MISO, on transmission, is there anything we should know about ATC? Your friends at some of the adjacent utilities have seen positive revisions, and meaningful positive revisions at that. Anything we'd be aware of? Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question. Let me put it this way. Scott and Kevin and I don't like a lot of white space in our capital plan. And so in essence, we have pulled out of our capital plan any potential ATC investments outside of our footprint. So what you see and what you'll see in more detail at EEI and our 5-year capital plan, is really solid stuff that we know is going to have to be built by ATC in our footprint. But we deliberately pulled out anything outside of the footprint, because essentially, right now that would be white space. And we just don't like a lot of white space. We like to be able to show you exactly what we're going to do. Joseph Fletcher : And I think the potential exists as more and more renewable get into the system, that there may be more transmission projects that do come in the future. But we took out all the white space. Gale Klappa : That's what I was going to discuss just a little bit. But look, I'd have to study this from our peers, my suspicion is that a lot of that additional capital is for Wisconsin, for additional opportunities on the renewable side. If there is something there, it will be upside for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Just continuing on the tax question. Are you guys -- do you have any insight at all as to whether you think the PTCs might be extended beyond the current program? And then separately from that, if the PTCs or as things start to wind down, do you think that on the infrastructure bucket you might start focusing more on solar projects rather than wind at some point in the future? Gale Klappa : Mike, two things. First of all, and you probably picked this up. There had been some rumblings on one or two of the house committees in Washington about the potential extension of some of the tax credits associated with renewables. If that were to happen, our understanding is that it would occur in the tax extenders bill that will be likely to be voted on like at 11 :59 on New Year's Eve. So if that happens, great. But we are not counting on that. With the plan we've laid out and the additional investment we've put into the 5-year plan in our infrastructure business, we're assuming that the production tax credits roll down as they would roll down from the current law. So that's kind of the answer to the first part of your question. I think the second part, if they roll down at the current law stays in place and the production tax credits become less valuable, will that push us more to solar? Probably not. Although we continue to look at solar projects as well as wind, as well as other natural gas infrastructure that would fit our risk profiles. But everything we have seen so far would indicate that the better projects for us still stay with wind, even with a potential reduction in the value of the tax credits. Michael Weinstein : So, I mean, if there is an extension to 11 :59 on New Year's Eve, should I be expecting an update to the capital forecast toward the infrastructure bucket? Gale Klappa : No. Not necessarily. This is what we think -- we think what we've got in that plan is our sweet spot. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Real quickly. Does the change in the capital spend forecast change your expected kind of 5-year CAGR for rate-based growth? Or is law of big numbers kicking in because your rate base growth has grown so much that expectation takes this higher capital level at utility to maintain the same rate base growth percentage level? Gale Klappa : Well, what I can tell you, Michael, and thank you for the question, is that if you look at the whole Wheel of Fortune, as we call it, in terms of the breakdown of our capital spending, our asset base across our company, given this 5-year plan, will grow at 7% a year. Michael Lapides : Got it. And do you anticipate having to use holding company debt at all to fund the growth at the utility, so will the utilities be self-financing? I know holding company financing will be used to finance the wind projects outside of the utility. I'm just trying to think about financing the utilities themselves. Gale Klappa : Occasionally, we do use commercial paper to fund utility infrastructure growth. But by and large, given the equity in that situation, by and large, that will be a timing thing. Scott? Scott Lauber : Right. And for the most part, our utilities are doing dividend up to the parent to support the overall dividend of the corporation. And remember, that We Power also is a positive cash flow item that goes up to the parent. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then just last item, I noticed the spend on generation is down relative to the prior year forecast. Not a lot, just under $200 million. Just curious what's the driver of that? And where are you in the process about thinking about whether there could be incremental coal plant retirements and therefore a need for other forms of generation, incremental and developed, a couple hundred megawatts of solar you have coming? Gale Klappa : Well, when you look at the new 5-year plan compared to the 5-year plan that we rolled out at this time a year ago, probably the biggest difference in the generation piece is that we completed, actually what we call the rise units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. That was a fairly sizable capital expenditure. Those units are in service. They are working great. They are providing very cost-effective energy to the Upper Peninsula including the iron ore mine, which by the way, the iron ore mine demand for electricity is up considerably this year. But I think the big difference you see is that we essentially put into service a large capital project. What is really kind of replacing that, as you mentioned, is the solar capacity that we're now gotten an approval for, and the additional solar capacity that we're hoping to receive approval for in the spring of 2020. And then to answer your question about additional coal retirements. Our focus in the next 12 months -- next 15 months or so is going to be on getting those solar capacity in service and operating well. We don't have any immediate plans to retire any additional coal units in the next 12 to 15 months.  However, having said that, we will continue to collaborate and have good interactive discussions with our major customers, with the commission staff, as we continue to refine our generation plan going forward. And obviously MISO is a big factor in whether or not any units can be retired as well. So you never say never, but certainly our plan for the next 12 to 15 months is to focus on getting the capacity in, the solar capacity in an operating well and to continue to look at the economics in the future of our system. Operator : Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful Mehta : So maybe on the industrial growth point that you talked about earlier. If there is more trade uncertainty and industrial growth continues to be weak, do you see at some point going into 2020 that's starting to impact other factors? I know you mentioned the margins are thin, but obviously that supports helping spread the costs out on a larger base. How do you see that industrial growth weakness if it rolls into 2020? Gale Klappa : Well, and I think, there's a good possibility it will go into 2020. However, we have anticipated this. We have looked at this. It was part of our thinking in the rate case. So I don't see any change in our outlook even given continued weakness of the kind we have seen in the industrial sector. Scott? Scott Lauber : I agree completely. And we've been monitoring our industrial sales weekly in fact, and we've been factoring this into, like Gale said, our rate case settlement and what we are looking at for the future years. Praful Mehta : Got you. So what kind of growth would you assume for 2020, I guess, on the industrial side just to be more specific then? Gale Klappa : Well, we're right in the middle now of our updated assessment with our major industrial customers. We have a process that we've had in place for years where we actually interview our large industrial customers on their outlook for 2020, and then we update our plan. So nothing we're seeing right now would change the answer we've given you. But you'll see in either December or January, you'll see our updated forecast. I would remind you, though, that we're still seeing very significant economic development opportunities that are coming into service not next year. But as Kevin pointed out, I mean we've got Foxconn ramping up 2021, 2022. We've got HARIBO coming in. We've got Komatsu coming in. So I don't expect that you're going to see any change in our longer-term growth forecast. Kevin? Joseph Fletcher : I would add to that, Gale. If you look at, for example you mentioned Foxconn just from an economic development perspective, when you see businesses like that come to a region, and we've mentioned that at EEI we'll refresh it coming up here next week, there's a lot of industries that are there to support Foxconn but just peripheral industries and not buying customers that are being added as well. That happens when you have these areas that become very popular in the growth. And that's what we're seeing in that particular area of our state at this particular time. More to come when talk a little bit at EEI. Gale Klappa : So to summarize, Praful, I wouldn't get overly concerned about this bit of downturn that we're seeing in industrial. It's not something that we have not -- it is something that we had anticipated and planned for. Praful Mehta : Got you. Super helpful color. And then maybe just quickly on the equity side. You mentioned that you're going to become a cash taxpayer but you have all these investments in the renewable side that probably help you offset most of the cash taxes. Just wanted to understand, you also mentioned no equity need. Is there a push up in the credit metrics? As in, do the metrics get a little weaker over time? Or do you still have the ability to maintain the metrics but still don't need equity over this time period? Gale Klappa : We will maintain our metrics, and we do not need additional equity. So that's one of those, read my lips, no new equity. And the metrics stay in very good shape. Operator : Your next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Vedula Murti : A few things. When I was looking at the adjusted retail sales, your normalized or whatever. It seems like it's pretty seems fairly weak across the board in terms of residential/small commercial. If ever, I'm just wondering if you can maybe speak to kind of what you're seeing and whether, as we go forward, whether that's going to be something we continue to see? Or whether that -- just normalized whether there's any factors that are kind of distorting that? Gale Klappa : Vedula, you'll probably say, \"I've heard this before from you,\" and you have. Our weather normalization techniques in this industry are not great. And in fact, Scott and I were just talking about this as we saw the numbers come in. Everybody does their best at weather normalization. But frankly, the error margin or the margin of error in the weather normalization is pretty significant. So I think both Scott and I believe that the residential and commercial piece that looked a little bit weak is probably just because we didn't get the weather normalization right last year. The industrial, I talked about, you probably heard me say, it's down. I think we're in a pause. But we've taken this into account as we look forward, and we don't see any significant deterioration from that drop in our low-margin customers in terms of usage. Scott? Scott Lauber : No. You're exactly right, Gale. And the fact that pulled up last year's investors or the deck, and the residential customers actually normalized last year were about 2%, and we talked about that being a little high. Now we're showing 0.2 year-to-date. So we get -- average them together, it's right in that 1%. So I'm not really concerned. I really do agree there's most likely related more to last year than this year, but more of a trending -- it's not a trending issue. Joseph Fletcher : And there's going to be a lot of air conditioning next year, next summer, when somebody comes to town, given. Scott Lauber : That's right. Joseph Fletcher : If you look at next year, we're going to be hosting, as I am sure all of you know, the DNC. And as Gale mentioned, anything around downtown Milwaukee area would be residential, industrial commercial. All electricity will be flowing. All air conditions will be on. And it will be a great time for us. So we're looking forward to that. Vedula Murti : When I think -- one of the things that always was a hallmark that you guys have been able to do was talk about your competitive advantage in terms of rates. But in all residential commercial, industrial classes within the region and given the overall period of time and the investment, can you refresh us as to how you are viewing that? And because -- if I'm not mistaken, it seems like it's now -- that advantage has been compressed. Gale Klappa : I suspect during -- certainly, during the period when we were putting all of our Power the Future investment into place, investments that were badly needed, that advantage was somewhat compressed. But we've just come off of a 4-year freeze in rates. In fact, our base rates for our customers were lower in 2019 than they were in 2015. And then you look around the neighborhood and you see double-digit rate increases by many of the utilities in Michigan. I'm sure you saw Exelon in Minnesota and Northern States Power Minnesota just asked for a 15% rate increase over 3 years. We feel very good about our competitive position. And by the way, in our rate settlement, as you know, for our largest subsidiary, We Energies, customer rates are only going up 1.3%. Vedula Murti : I appreciate that. And one last thing. Given what you did with Pleasant Prairie in terms of your voluntary securitization on some of the investment, what -- how should -- can you give us a little thought as to -- I expect it's not simply a one-off. But this is an idea of how to use a tool going forward over the next few years. And can you give us some thoughts as to how, at least as of today, how we should be thinking about and how you're thinking about using that tool going forward? Gale Klappa : Well, let me start by saying there is a law in the State of Wisconsin, which allows companies like ours to request securitization for environmental -- the cost of environmental projects. So that's the law in the State of Wisconsin. It is a voluntary law. In other words, it can't be ordered. But it's a voluntary law. We actually supported the development and the vote on that law, oh my goodness, back about 15 years ago. So we thought it was a good tool for this instance. I think the commissioners in their public setting in their public discussion of our rate to review a couple of weeks ago agreed that for this particular case, this worked exceptionally well and benefited all of our constituents. But they also said, don't count on these being the full template going forward. And we certainly understand that. So I think there'll be a lot of discussions among all of the stakeholders and the commission staff going forward including, I suspect, the governor's office, because as you know he would like to get to a net zero-carbon by 2050. And that's going to require additional technology and retirements of existing units. So I think the short answer is, time will tell, but we have one good tool and equipment right now, and we'll see where we go. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : So let me ask you this. Just to follow up on Vedula's question on the sales growth forecast. Last I recall, you guys were looking at electric, I think, 0 to 0.5% through 2021, and then 1.2% to 1.5% in 2022 will be on? Gale Klappa : Yes. Paul Patterson : So is that still the case? And does that include industrial? Gale Klappa : Yes [indiscernible]. Paul Patterson : But what would it be without industrial, I guess. Without industrial, what would it be, I guess? And why does it go up again in 2022 and beyond? Gale Klappa : Well it goes up in 2022 and beyond because we have this, as I've mentioned, this very large pipeline of economic development projects that will be coming into operation, from Foxconn to HARIBO to Komatsu to Amazon to Milwaukee Tool. There's a very significant number. Yes, a very significant number of projects that are either in the groundbreaking stage right now or under construction, where they will be significant additional electric demand coming out in 2022, 2023 and 2024. So we'll obviously put together, as we finish up the year, our revised sales forecast. But as Scott mentioned, the downturn that we've seen, this pause that we've seen in industrial demand, we anticipated this. It was part of the discussions in the rate settlement. So I don't see this causing any kind of major change in our longer term forecast. Scott? Scott Lauber : No, I agree. And specifically, the longer-term forecast, we are still seeing the good construction projects are continuing here at Foxconn, Amazon, all the stuff that Gale and Kevin just mentioned. So that's positive. Unemployment is still at near record lows here in Wisconsin, so that's been positive. And on the gas side, we continue to see great customer growth. So I'm not really that concerned in our forecast. And remember, what we put into forecast are only announced projects. We really didn't put in that secondary effect of other smaller customers coming in on the secondary or the residential load. So we only put what we actually knew was out there and coming, and we're monitoring those literally on a monthly basis here. So I feel very comfortable with that forecast. Paul Patterson : Okay. So when we look at that forecast, we should be thinking about the increase being essentially sort of economic development large customers, which I would assume, again, to your comments earlier, sort of low margin customers, correct? Or because you're not really counting in sort of higher-margin ancillary effect. Is that correct? Gale Klappa : That is correct. That's exactly right. And I would just a remind you, because of kind of nailed it, but I would remind everyone, that the low-margin industrial customers, particularly those on real time pricing, really do not drive our earnings growth. Paul Patterson : I got you. Now just on Foxconn. There's been a lot of local press that they really are coming through with what was originally expected in terms of the original announcement, et cetera. There's been some, last month or so, a lot of press about that. I was just wondering if you could comment, since you made comments about Foxconn before, about how you're -- what you're seeing, I guess, on the ground or your expectations with respect to that. Gale Klappa : I'm glad you asked the question. My overall advice for what it's worth is, ignore the noise and look at what's actually going on in the ground. So what's actually going on in the ground is that they are following through in great detail on the revised plan that they announced in January. So remember, the plan was to have 3 phases of development, which eventually over a 10-year period would add 13,000 well-paying jobs. They have not backed away from the 13,000 over the longer period of time. They have redesigned Phase 1, and Phase 1 will be a bit smaller in terms of the footprint. But in their original Phase 1, they had 2 things that were changed. Originally, they were going to build Gen 10/5 LCD plant. They are now building a Gen 6. That is not inferior technology, but the difference is Gen 6 plant produces smaller-sized LCD screens. So there is a downsizing in terms of the footprint and the electricity demand from a Gen 10 to a Gen 6. However, they've add now to their Phase 1 plan and in fact they are going to be in construction later this year on a high-capacity data center.  So when we look at -- and our technical folks meet with Foxconn every single week, and I meet with the Foxconn folks every 6 weeks. When you look now at our projected demand for Phase 1, even though it has changed to some from their original thinking, the overall demand hasn't changed because of the addition of a very significant high-capacity data center. So I really have a different view than what you might be seeing in the press. They did revise their thinking in terms of Phase 1. But Phase 1 is rocking. And if you drove from Milwaukee to Chicago, you would see off the side of the freeway enormous amount of development going on, and they are following through to a T on their revised Phase 1 plan. Joseph Fletcher : Gale, let me just add too, in addition to the things you just mentioned that Foxconn are doing. They're also building a, they call the smart manufacturing center, where they're actually building the hardware from servers and things like that to offer for service for them, for their data centers and others. So in addition to what you mentioned, there is additional high tech facilities with the drawing board and the plan to build immediately. Gale Klappa : Amen. All right, folks. Well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, feel free to call Beth Straka, and she can be reached at 414-221-4639. Thanks, everybody. See you in about a week. Bye, bye.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year End 2019 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.  Before the conference call begins, I'll remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2019. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; Scott Lauber, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Tony Reese, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2019 earnings of $3.58 a share, and I'm pleased to report that we delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance. Our customer satisfaction was swift recovery from severe July storms that caused extensive damage to our system. As we review our financial results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. In fact, our ratio of holding company debt to total debt now stands at 28% that beats our 30% goal. In 2019, we also eliminated regulatory assets for transmission costs, and we continued to leverage the benefits of tax reform for both customers and shareholders. In addition, we worked effectively to settle our Wisconsin rate reviews, which represent approximately 70% of our regulated assets. We also took our environmental efforts a step further. We set a new goal in 2019 to reduce the rate of methane emissions from our natural gas distribution system by 30% per mile by the year 2030. Our ongoing work to modernize Chicago's natural gas delivery network is key to achieving this goal, and we continue to analyze our climate-related risks and opportunities. In fact, the recent Moody's report focused on the risk exposure of regulated utilities to heat stress, water stress and extreme rainfall. I'm pleased to note that WEC Energy ranks among the lowest risk companies in our sector. During 2019, we also reached a number of significant milestones in our Infrastructure segment. The Coyote Ridge Wind Farm is now in service in South Dakota and will contribute a full year of earnings in 2020. As you may recall Coyote Ridge consists of 39 turbines with a capacity of roughly 97 megawatts. We invested approximately $145 million for our 80% share of the windfarm and we\u2019re entitled to 99% of the tax benefits. As you know, a significant portion of our earnings from this facility come in the form of production tax credits. Project has a 12 year off-take agreement with Google Energy LLC for all of the energy produced. We also announced back in September that we will acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Thunderhead Wind Energy Center for $338 million. Invenergy is developing this project in Nebraska and we expect it to be in service at the end of 2020. The site will consist of 108 GE wind turbines with a combined capacity of 300 megawatts. The project has a long-term off-take agreement with AT&T for a 100% of the energy produced. We expect Thunderhead will qualify for production tax credits and a 100% bonus depreciation. Then earlier this week, folks, we announced plans for another new development. We've agreed to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Blooming Grove Wind Farm for $345 million. Invenergy is developing this project in Illinois with commercial operation expected to begin by the end of this year. The site will host 94 wind turbines with a total capacity of 250 megawatts. Blooming Grove has a 12 year off-take agreement with affiliates of two multinational companies with our investment grade. We expect that Blooming Grove will be eligible for a 100% bonus depreciation as well as production tax credits. Overall, we're very encouraged about these investments in renewable energy, which will serve strong businesses for years to come. We expect a return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns. Of course, we\u2019re being very selective as we vet future projects. We're only interested in projects that achieve our financial return metrics and do not change our risk profile. Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy that\u2019s supporting our company's longer-term growth. Wisconsin's unemployment remains near record lows for the state and we continue to see strong economic development projects in the pipeline. Foxconn is moving forward with its plan to create a high-tech campus in Racine County, South of Milwaukee. Work on a Generation 6 fabrication plant for liquid crystal display screens is progressing. The fab, which spans about 1 million square feet is now enclosed and work is beginning on the internal structures. Foundations are also in place for a high-capacity data center. In addition, Foxconn has announced plans for a smart manufacturing facility. Construction crews began lifting the exterior walls into place for the smart manufacturing plant earlier this week. Based on public data, we estimate that Foxconn's investment in Wisconsin over the past two years has risen to approximately $500 million. Turning a bit further South in the Kenosha area, Uline has announced plans to invest $130 million in two new facilities and bring approximately 350 new jobs to the area. Uline as you may know, is a leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging supplies with headquarters here in Wisconsin. In addition, Milwaukee Tool has announced another expansion. Milwaukee Tool will invest $100 million in a large multipurpose campus Northwest of the city in Menomonee Falls. The company also committed to adding 870 jobs in Wisconsin by the year 2025. These are exciting times. We look forward to more economic development and opportunity across the region. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more insight on our operations and our regulatory calendar. Kevin, all yours. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Gale. First, I'd like to share some good news. Our largest subsidiary, We Energies was named the most reliable electric utility in the Midwest for the ninth year running. Wisconsin Public Service also was recognized for the first time for outstanding reliability performance. Now, I'll briefly review where we stand in our four state jurisdictions. As you\u2019ll recall, in March of last year, we filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates for We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. And in August, we entered into settlement agreements with the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Clean Wisconsin. On December the 19th, the Commission issued its written order of firming those settlement agreements and setting rates for the next two years. New rates went into effect on January the 1st. During 2019, we also continued to make progress in developing solar generation for our regulated businesses in Wisconsin. You may recall that in Wisconsin we're planning a total of 300 megawatts of utility scale solar capacity, the first facilities of this size in the state. We\u2019ve broken ground on two solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, Two Creeks and Badger Hollow launch. Our share will total 200 megawatts for an expected investment of approximately $260 million. Both projects are scheduled to begin producing energy by the end of this year. And this past August, at We Energies we filed with the Wisconsin Commission for approval to acquire 100 megawatts of capacity at the Badger Hollow II Solar Farm. The projected investment would be $130 million. We expect to receive the Commission's decision this spring. We also see efficient natural gas storage, another important part of our regulated business strategy. In particular Wisconsin needs more natural gas peaking capacity at the highest demand times on the coldest days. We're continuing to evaluate site plans for two liquefied natural gas facilities to help to meet our customers\u2019 needs during the winter peak. We expect to invest approximately $370 million in these projects. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2021. Turning to Illinois, we continue making progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. This program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. We're approximately 28% complete with our replacement of outdated, corroded natural gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago. We continue to project an investment of $280 million to $300 million per year on average in this program. Now, let's turn to Michigan. In 2019, we completed our new natural gas-fired power plants in Michigan's Upper Peninsula on time and on budget. These plants are now providing a cost-effective, long-term power supply for our customers in the Upper Peninsula. With these new units operating, we were able to retire our older, less efficient coal-fired plant at Presque Isle. This resulted in significant operations and maintenance savings and reduced CO2 emissions. Taking a broader look across our business, we continue to focus on operating efficiency and financial discipline. As a whole, we exceeded our 2019 goal to reduce our day-to-day operation and maintenance costs. Our goal was a reduction of 4% and we actually achieved a 7% reduction. We have set a goal to further reduce our O&M by an incremental 2% to 3% in 2020 as well. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you very much. As you'll recall, ladies and gentlemen, our 2020 guidance is in a range of $3.71 a share to $3.75 a share. This translates to an earnings growth of between 6% and 7.1% of our 2019 base of $3.50 a share. Recall, $3.50 a share was the midpoint of our original guidance for 2019. And finally, a word about our dividend policy. At its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend of 63.25 cents a share for the first quarter of 2020. That's an increase of 7.2%. New quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.53 a share. This marks the 17th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We are right in the middle of that range now and so I expect our dividend growth will continues to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now, with details on our 2019 results and our outlook for 2020 is our CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our 2019 earnings for $3.58 per share increased $0.24 per share compared to 2018, a 7.2% increase. In 2019, we benefited from additional capital investment, reduction in tax credit and continued emphasis on cost control. While all of our utilities met their financial goals, our Wisconsin utilities earned their fully-allowed ROE and customers will see the benefit going forward through the sharing mechanism. We posted the earnings packet to our website this morning. It includes a comparison of fourth quarter and full-year results. My focus will be on the full year, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 10 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2019 was $1.530 billion as compared to operating income of $1.470 billion in 2018, an increase of $63 million. Recall that as part of our previous rate settlement in Wisconsin, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory assets. The plan continued through year-end. And as we expected, the transmission escrow asset balance at We Energies was eliminated. My update will focus on changes in operating income by segment excluding the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income increased $42 million net of these adjustments. Lower operation and maintenance expense resulted in approximately $105 million increase in operating income driven by efficiencies and effective cost control across the enterprise. This positive impact on operating income was largely offset by a few items. First, lower sales volume due to primarily cooler summer weather conditions accounted for approximately $26 million decrease in operating income. Second, depreciation and amortization increased $35 million as we continued to execute on our capital plan. And finally, operating income was reduced by a $22 million tax item that flow through operating. This was fully offset by a reduction in tax expense. In Illinois, operating income increased by $36 million, primarily as a result of our continued investment in the safety and reliability of the Peoples Gas System. Operating income at our other state segment decreased $3.5 million. Turning now to our Energy Infrastructure segment. Operating income at this segment was up $800,000 driven by additional investment in our Power the Future plans. As expected, the Bishop Hill, Upstream and Coyote Ridge Wind Farms did not have a material impact on operating income. Recall, a significant portion of earnings from these wind farms come in the form of production tax credits, which are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits contributed approximately $0.08 per share to our earnings for the year compared to $0.01 in 2018. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased by $12 million. This variance reflects a $5.3 million gain that we recorded in 2018 related to the sale of a legacy business, as well as an impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 on assets that we inherited from the Integrys acquisition. Combining these variances and excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules, consolidated operating income increased $62.8 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled over $128 million, a decrease of $9.1 million as compared to 2018. Our earnings from ATC decreased by $19 million as a result of a recent FERC order addressing the MISO complaints. Going forward, we're recording ATC earnings, assuming a 10.38% return on equity. This includes a 50 basis point added for our participation in MISO. Other income net increased by $32 million driven by investment gains associated with our benefit plans. Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense included in our operating segment. The remaining increase relates to the non-service cost component of our pension and benefit plans. Our net interest expense increased by $53 million, mostly due to higher long-term debt balances to fund the capital investment. This excludes the impact of the new lease guidance.  Our consolidated income tax expense, net of tax repairs, decreased by $42 million. The major drivers were production tax credits from our wind investments and the 2018 tax reform item that I mentioned earlier. Our 2019 effective tax rate was 9.9%. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 20.6%. Looking forward, we expect that 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%. This includes the effects of the unprotected tax benefits that are being refunded to customers following our recent Wisconsin rate decision. Excluding these benefits, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projection show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our capital plan. Turning to our cash flow statement. Our FFO-to-debt was 18.5% in 2019. Looking ahead, we expect FFO-to-debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(K) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.5 billion in 2019, a $112 million increase from 2018.  Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2019, our utilities were serving approximately 10,000 more electric and 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings packet. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were down 2.8% compared to 2018, and at a weather-normal basis, deliveries were down 1.7%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 2.6% versus 2018 and by 1.8% on a weather-normal basis. This excludes gas used for power generation.  And now I'll briefly touch on our 2020 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment. We are forecasting a slight decrease of one-half of 1% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine. We project the Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries to increase by seven-tenth of 1%. This excludes gas used for power generation, and of course, both of these projections are adjusted for leap year in 2020. Finally, let's look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2020. Last year, we earned $1.33 per share in the first quarter. As you recall, this included approximately $0.04 related to the colder-than-normal weather in 2019. Factoring in this and the 16% warmer-than-normal January, we project first quarter 2020 earnings to be in the range of $1.32 per share to a $1.34 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. And with that, I will turn the things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're continuing to perform at a high level, on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shahriar Pourreza : So let me -- just a couple questions here. You guys are backfilling this infrastructure capital budget relatively fast especially with last week's acquisition. What's the spending shape look like given sort of these recent opportunities i.e. is there any opportunities to provide upside to your current guide or is this just kind of an acceleration of that spend? And then Scott, I know you mentioned on the cash tax position being a partial payer. But does that include last week's acquisition? Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity there. Gale Klappa : Well, Shahriar, we will be happy to answer those questions. First, I would view our announcement this week on Blooming Grove, basically an acceleration of a five year plan. If you kind of looked at what we've accomplished so far with what we believe are very high quality projects, we're almost -- we're about 38% already in terms of the projects that we've agreed to acquire, right about 38% of the spending we projected at our five year plan. But I would view it as an acceleration and I will tell you why. Our five year plan, which projected about $1.8 billion in this particular segment of capital spending essentially was a happy marriage of the high quality projects that we saw, that we really had a strong interest in, coupled with our ability to utilize all of the tax benefits. If you put all that together, it kind of shook out at $1.8 billion. So Scott, I would view this as an acceleration. Scott Lauber : Right. It's just it's just the timing. And when you look at the tax position, and we see a very small taxpayer, it\u2019s going to be under $15 million, $20 million, because of the tax rules, there are still some tax payments that are made. But as you know, we're slowly starting with the PTC's work into 2021 1Q. So that'll not be a full taxpayer in 2021. But still when you look at our five year plan, a lot of capacity is on our tax side. Gale Klappa : And Shahriar remember, this particular wind farm doesn't come into service until the very end of 2020. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just on the regulated renewable, there's obviously a lot that you're doing there. Can I just get a sense on how this could impact your decision to exercise the West Riverside option to purchase maybe up to 200 megawatts of that plant? Is there sort of a read-through on that option, and whether you would exercise it? Gale Klappa : No, I wouldn't do any read-through on that. That is still something that we're analyzing, still something we're taking a look at. As we continue to review our demand forecasts, our needs, the impact of renewables, but that is still something that's on the tables Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just lastly, Gale, a little bit more of a policy question. I mean obviously we had a Commission announcement last -- a couple of weeks ago around resignation. So we're obviously likely going to see a bit of a democratic shift with Evers\u2019 appointment. Is there kind of any read-throughs that we should be thinking about from a policy standpoint as it looks like the majority may change, business as usual or could this kind of accelerate some of the solar decarbonization plans that are out there? Gale Klappa : My own sense is, I would look at any additional appointments of the Commission largely as business as usual. But I will say, and remind everyone that the Governor has appointed a climate task force. He has announced a aspirational goal late last year to basically have carbon-free electricity by 2050. In this task force in which our company is represented, had its actual first meeting just a week or so ago. So, during this year, I think you will see some policy recommendations related to decarbonization coming out of this task force. In many ways the Public Service Commission would in all probability need to implement some of those policy changes that they were adopted. But the policy shift that I would see coming, if there is one, would really come through the Governor's task force on climate change, if that makes sense to you. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon : Can we unpack the O&M performance a little bit because it really is quite impressive? If I look at Page 8 of your release, I think you\u2019re telling me I should be looking at the O&M as adjusted for impact of the flow-through of tax repairs, right? That's like the clean number. Scott Lauber : Yes. That's right. Greg Gordon : And it\u2019s down dramatically. And although more so I think because when I look at the rabbi trust activity, that's basically offset in O&M by an offsetting adjustment in O&M. So, if I adjust it for the rabbi trust activity, the O&M comparison would be even better than it looks, is that -- I think that's correct. And if so, can you unpack for us what the sort of structural savings are that are now flowing through on a full year basis from the activities you pursued or sort of permanent benefits? And I think there's more to come with the investments you've made in technology and things like that. So, I am just wondering, A, what's the structural improvement in O&M and where they do come from? And B, what the follow-on from continued activities on that front? Gale Klappa : Would be happy to. Let me frame all of this for you and then we're going to let Scott and Kevin weigh in on some of details. But we did have an exceptional quarter in terms of continued efficiencies across the business and there are a couple of factors that I think are important here. The first is that, during 2019, we saw essentially pretty much a full-year benefit of the implementation of our ERP system across the entire enterprise. So, that was helpful. And we're continuing -- as people get used to that new system, we're continuing to see efficiencies and benefits that we thought we would. And then compared to Q4 of a year ago, compared to Q4 of 2018 for example, there were there were significant O&M savings related to the closer of coal fired power plants. Remember in -- we've basically over the last several months, in year and a half or so, we've retired three old or less efficient coal fired power plants, units at Presque Isle, up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where the latest to be retired in the spring of 2019. We have the Pulliam plant near Green Bay retired and we had Pleasant Prairie retired. So we're seeing -- in the fourth quarter we saw O&M benefits flow through from no longer having to incur O&M for the operation of those plants.  Then we had some of our technology investments continue to kick in. And as Kevin said, we're projecting additional O&M savings that we think we're going to gain here. And we're on track to gain in 2020. So Scott, Kevin, anything you\u2019d like to add. Kevin Fletcher : You already mentioned the ERP. If you look at common platforms across our system in the fourth quarter of this year, we will complete our customer information system to have that across all of our companies. We have already seen even this past year some savings from what we had in place already. But in addition to that, through last year and focusing on the future, just looking at process improvement, so as we look across like the jurisdictions, do benchmarking, we're looking at common standards and where it makes sense, so to have a proactive and the similar approaches across our system. That has produced some positive results for us on our O&M reduction, and it will continue to. Gale Klappa : Scott? Scott Lauber : I don't think there is anything else. It is across the enterprise, though. Everyone has a O&M takeout, opportunities and efficiencies to gain. Gale Klappa : And we're doing that Greg, which I'm very pleased about and I thought we would be able to. We're doing that while increasing customer satisfaction. So that's one of the reasons I mentioned earlier in my remarks. As we tracked our operational and financial performance, we had a record year across virtually every meaningful measure of performance. Greg Gordon : So there is an incremental improvement on run rate O&M as you get to the sort of fully baked savings from the coal plant closures. And then there's incremental O&M benefits but from the -- that you think you'll get from the ERP and also from the rollout of the CIS amongst other things. Gale Klappa : You nailed it. That's exactly right. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just following up on Greg's question here. I think that's really germane. Can we dig in a little bit further to the prospects to sustain these levels of cost reductions? I mean they're really quite dramatic. I mean I think Greg emphasized it enough. But the point being, how sustainable are these given how outsized they appear to be relative to the balance, not just on a trailing basis but prospectively for \u201820 here as you think through the balance of your playing period. And maybe even to push the point a bit further, how identified is it just -- not just in '20, but through the balance of the year financial period that you're forecasting in terms of these levels of reductions? Gale Klappa : Well, I'll take a stab at that, certainly Scott can add anything he would like to and Kevin as well. But let me say this, we believe and I think our track record demonstrates that the kind of cost savings that you saw, that we continue to believe we're going to continue on a downward path, those are very sustainable. We wouldn't be publicly committing to them if we didn't think we could absolutely sustain them. So again, we took 7% of the day-to-day O&M out of the business in 2019, 2% to 3% projected reduction in 2020. And again, we're doing this I think in a very highly planned and deliberate way. And a good chunk of it is coming really from two areas. One we mentioned before that we're getting the full benefit of now, and that's the O&M takeout from the closure of less efficient coal-fired power plants. The other is the investment in technology. So my view guys would be highly sustainable. Kevin Fletcher : Gale, I'd agree, we just mentioned a couple of things that we're doing, but let me add one more on the customer service side, though, we have and are investing in our AMI infrastructure and we've seen savings from having that in place to reduce the rolls of truck that will continue. And we'll see those opportunities ahead in the upcoming years. Also leveraging technology like mobile apps as an example, as we get that out into our customers we will be able to have more interaction with our customers and give them opportunities to pay their bills online, minimize paper billing, things of that nature. So I would agree that sustainability of that is built into a lot of what we're doing on customer service side, especially with the things that I just mentioned. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Let me if I can please, to jump a little further. What about the compounding nature of that trajectory right? 2% to 3% is impressive, but through your forecast, do you anticipate compounding of that trajectory? And then perhaps the really relevant second question is, you've done it before. How do we think about the cadence of rate cases? I know we're getting out a little bit but just given the scale of cost reductions here, certainly the question doesn't seem too early in terms of across any one of your jurisdictions given the enterprise wide cost reductions that are contemplated here? I mean, i.e., pushing them out. Gale Klappa : I'm chuckling because we just got through the rate reviews for 70% of our regulated assets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I know, I recognize it but then the cost reductions are incredible. Gale Klappa : Well, we appreciate that. Let me say this, historically, as you know, in Wisconsin, the Commission has liked and has really requested in every two year cadence for rate reviews. But that's not to say that set in concrete. We'll take a look at it as we go forward and see where we are, see where the Commission\u2019s sentiment is, et cetera. But long story short, we feel very good about our ability to execute. And again, do so in a way that maintains high reliability and high levels of customer satisfaction. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, too early to tell. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Michael Sullivan : Just one more on the O&M. What do you guys assume for earned ROEs now that you've got this kind of different sharing band where you can over earn a little bit before you get back to customers. Where does this -- these O&M savings targets put you on a earned ROE basis? Gale Klappa : We're assuming as we have in the past that we earn the allowed rates of return in each one of our retail jurisdictions. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Sorry, just to clarify, is that like at the electric utilities, is it 10%, or up to the 10.25% that you can do before sharing? Gale Klappa : Right now we're assuming 10%. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And then over to the sales growth. So, I think for 2020, electric, you're forecasting down a little bit and if we go back to some of your EEI slides, there\u2019s supposed to be a tick up in the next couple years and more so as you get into \u201822, \u201823. Can you just give us some color around key milestones that we should be looking for on economic growth that that's going to reach that from down a little bit to up close to overall percent? Gale Klappa : Yes. Happy to, Michael. First of all, the uptick that we continue to project -- and it\u2019s a pretty slight uptick, the uptick that we're projecting in the 2022, 2023 timeframe is really driven by the amazing economic development projects that I talked about a little earlier in our remarks. We have not seen any slowdown in terms of the number of economic development projects, the amount of new construction, just the continuing economic growth or the pipeline of projects that are being announced here in Southeastern Wisconsin in particular. So, we still feel pretty confident about the uptick in the longer-term. The shorter-term meaning for 2020, is really driven by like for example, the large industrial segment. It's really driven by the interviews that our people have with our key account customers and feedback into our projections. It's also driven a bit by weather normalization. Remember, we had two warmer-than-normal summers back-to-back. So you look at weather normalization, you look at conservation, you look at real-time feedback from our major industrial customers and you put it all together and it's like it's in there, that's what comes out. So, in total, a very modest decline, I believe Scott one-half of 1% is what we're projecting on retail absent the mines. Scott Lauber : Correct. So, a very modest decline. And once again, the projections that we have in the investor book are really the only projects that we know. It doesn't include the residential and secondary that we expect to come from it. It's just the known projects that have actually started turning curve already. So, it just takes a while to build a building and start using it. So, we expect those -- those are still on track to become. And like Gale said, our forecast is really out there talking to our customers and really fine-tuning it and the information we have, it\u2019s the best information we have. Gale Klappa : And we are still projecting -- even with the modest 0.5% decline, we're still projecting 6% to 7% EPS growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta : So, maybe just I guess the O&M point has been already debated and answered. So, appreciate that. I think on the energy infrastructure side, the $1.8 billion that was planned, you said you accelerated it with this latest acquisition. Do you expect with the tax appetite being what it is further down the road, do you expect that size increase through the 2024 timeframe, or do you expect the 1.8% to still will be the cap? Gale Klappa : At the moment, again, we will continue to look at this. But at the moment, I would view this as an acceleration and the $1.8 billion for the 5 years is still what we're looking at. Praful Mehta : And then, when we think about the tax appetite and you said that you would be small tax payer, how should we think about that taxpaying capacity in the '22, '24 timeframe? Is that you\u2019re still a small tax payer at that point or is that capacity increasing over time? Gale Klappa : Well, when you still look and you work everything in, we would still be a small taxpayer getting into that, being in that frame of time if we execute on all these capital projects, largely because of some of the tax rules that are out there, you still have to be a minimal taxpayer for some of the reasons. But we need to execute on all these capital projects to get to that level. Kevin Fletcher : Given the tax rules as Scott said, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will ever in a sustained period of time get to absolute zero. So when we say modest taxpayer, for example, I think Scott mentioned $15 million to $20 million this year. So I hope that puts things in context for you. Praful Mehta : Yes, no, it does and I appreciate that. And then just finally, in terms of credit, and the holdco debt side, I think you started by saying you've got improving credit, and your holdco debt is now down to 28%. Is there any target we should be thinking about around the holdco debt level and also the FFO-to-debt kind of credit that we should be thinking more longer term? Gale Klappa : We\u2019ll let Scott answer that. We do have an internal an internal cap on where we want to go or where we don't want to go with holdco credit -- holdco debt. Scott Lauber : So we look at that holdco, that holdco debt, it's down to 28%. Our target is to keep it below 30%. Now, if there's an opportunity, one year it may pop up or down, but -- and we feel comfortable of those ranges in our forecast here. And the FFO-to-debt in that 16 to 18 range. Now, last year, we had 18.5 but remember we were at in a sharing opportunity at Wisconsin utilities, that money will go back eventually to customers. So, next year may be on the lower end of that range, but still within that 16 to 18 range. Gale Klappa : And that range as you know, well supports our current credit ratings. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Just want to elaborate on the contracted infrastructure projects. So as of now what percent of 2020 EPS will come from that segment? And let's assume the five year plan stays at 1.8, it seems like the bias might be to the upside, what percent of earnings would be coming from that segment in five years? Gale Klappa : Well I can give you the number for this year. And obviously, well, we can do a little bit of public math here. But long story short, we got in 2019 about $0.02 a quarter of earnings from our infrastructure investments. Given the addition this year, a full year earnings for Coyote Ridge which went into service at the end of 2019, I would expect about $0.03 a quarter, Scott? Scott Lauber : About $0.03 a quarter. And remember the other projects we announced here in December of next year. So some impact but not a lot. Andrew Weisel : And then bigger picture, how big are you willing to let that segment be? Obviously they're high quality contracted assets. But they're not the regulated rate base contracts. So do you have sort of a mental ceiling of how big that could be as far as earnings mix? Gale Klappa : Yes, we do. At the moment, I would say that our internal plan would hold that segment of our business down to about 10% of our earnings. Andrew Weisel : Okay, very good. Then just one last one on that same topic. You said you've accelerated the spending, but you're not increasing it. What's the limiting factor of why you're not increasing it? Is it balance sheet opportunity for specific projects? Is it that 10% ceiling you just mentioned? How do you balance those? Gale Klappa : It's the happy marriage between the quality projects that we see in the pipeline that we are very interested in, and our tax appetite. If you put it all together and the $1.8 billion shakes out to something that we can -- we think we can both add quality projects to achieve and maximize our tax position. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Just on the last round of questioning, is there a reason why you won't -- or you aren't considering tax equity for continued expansion, considering the tax upside? Gale Klappa : No, I mean certainly we would be open to something like that in the future if the economics worked out. Right now the economics favor exactly what we're doing. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And on ATC, has there been any impact on long-term planning from the FERC's action on ROE in MISO. Gale Klappa : Short answer is no. And I think that\u2026 Michael Weinstein : You don\u2019t think that had an effect? Gale Klappa : Not yet because, as you know, it's now all up in the air again. So, these are -- as you know very well, transmission projects have a long gestation period. So, I wouldn't expect there to be some kind of a knee-jerk reaction in the first 30 or 60 days, particularly with all the appeals going on and the uncertainty of what the final result will be. Kevin Fletcher : Exactly Gale, and we're recording a 10.38, remember that long-term plan, we were assuming 10.2. So, 10.38 is a little north of that. Michael Weinstein : And I may have missed this before, but where do you guys stand in terms of dividend payout ratio targets? And what's the future growth rate for dividends, is it just going to track along with EPS at this point? Kevin Fletcher : Our policy is to pay out in a range of 65% to 70% of earnings. So a dividend payout ratio that is 65% to 70% of earnings. As I mentioned earlier, we right smacked that in the middle of that range right now. So we would project that dividend growth would be in-line with the growth in earnings per share. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with GS. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hey, Gale, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. I actually have several, they're all gas related, and I'll just kind of rattle them off. First of all, your gas demand forecast of, I think, it's 0.7%. Can you remind me when the last time you did sub-1% gas demand growth in Wisconsin? That's the first question. The second question is, where do you stand on the permitting and regulatory approval for their gas LNG facility at Wisconsin that you talked about a couple of months ago or a while ago? And then finally, any incremental thoughts on the need for new gas fired generation, either as partly transformation we're just meet demand part? Kevin Fletcher : All right, we'll be happy to try to take those up one by one. I think weather-normal, we were at 1.8 on retail gas. So we had a 1.8% growth in retail gas consumption on a weather-normal basis in 2019. You could probably go back in terms of when were we last below 1%. Whatever year that gas -- natural gas prices got to double-digits, I think we did not grow meaningfully at all in terms of natural gas demand from the retail side of the business. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes, exactly. When you think about it, yes, we've had 3% to 4% growth last year it was 1.8%. But now what we're really forecasting is really the customer growth aspect, not assuming any more conservation, but also assuming that people don't turn their houses from 69 to 74. People are going to stay comfortable. And we've also seen a lot of conversions the last couple of years from industrial for their own environmental goals to go convert from coal and oil to natural gas, so you only convert only once. So basically our forecast now is based on customer growth. Gale Klappa : And Michael on the LNG as far as the approval process, it's underway. And as I said in my prepared comments, we expect approval and we would begin construction in the summer of 2021 for operations in 2023. Michael Lapides : And then on the gas intervention side and kind of thinking about the mix of gas versus coal fired generation? Gale Klappa : Mix of gas versus coal fired? Michael Lapides : In terms of thinking about new gas generation needs\u2026 Gale Klappa : Well, as you know, we have an option with Alliant to buy into some point between now and say 2024 a portion of their new gas-fired combined cycle that's being built right now. That option is still on the table. We haven't made a final decision. Beyond that, we don't have any plans to propose any construction of new gas-fired generation. And of course, regardless of whether we add gas-fired generation or not, the percentage of gas-fired generation in our total mix will be going up and coal will be coming down as we've already retired about 40% of our existing coal-fired generating capacity. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon :  I just wanted to go back to the comment on what your expectations are as they sort of bake into your earnings growth aspiration, the 5 to 7. You said that you're targeting the authorized ROE without and not assuming that you maximize your opportunity to get into the higher end of the range. Should we assume that the midpoint of your guidance represents earning the authorized return and sort of like the high-end represents the ability to achieve other factors like earning that extra 25 basis points? Or if I'm not thinking about it correctly, can you give us some guidance as how you're thinking about that opportunity and what it might mean for your earnings outlook? Gale Klappa : Great question, Greg. Everyone in the room is nodding their head, you've got it. If we were modeling it, as we know you would be, we would assume fully authorized rate of return gets us to the midpoint of the guidance and then upside from there if we were to get into sharing. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : One last question I forgot to ask this. This is more of a strategic question. But around the country, you are seeing some cities ban improvements on natural gas distribution systems and pulling through full electrification of heating and everything else. And obviously the views from the Upper Midwest winter is little bit different than place like California. But do you have any view on where this all is going in terms of natural gas infrastructure, spending and you guys are -- you're kind of the experts of the turnaround business there. Gale Klappa : Well, it's a very good question, and I think you are correct. In the less -- in the warmer climate and the more tempered climates, there's clearly a push by some of the more active environmentalists, not only move away from coal but now we have a beyond gas campaign that we're seeing. For us, I think Michael it comes back to pure practicality and the recognition that if it's 40 below in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a heat pump is simply not going to keep your house warm, or even if it did, it would be so incredibly expensive that you simply couldn't deal with it. So for our Upper Midwest area and with the market share that we have for home and commercial heating with natural gas, I just don't see a major turn away from that for many, many years to come. I think the other piece of it is natural gas heating, natural gas furnaces continue to get even more efficient. And there are better ways, I think in terms of running the economy and continuing to reduce CO2 emissions. And if you look now at across the U.S. and in the upper Midwest, the number one contributor to CO2 emissions is no longer power generation, for example, it's transportation. I think the low hanging fruit here in terms of continuing to de-carbonize the economy, particularly in a region like the one we serve, is not moving away from natural gas home heating, it's actually electrification for vehicles. Kevin, I don't know if you have any view on that. Kevin Fletcher : Gale, I think you summed it up very well. The other thing that I just will add is as technology continues to evolve on the gas side we'll continue to be in a part of that and looking at it. But I think you summarized our position and our philosophy very well. Gale Klappa : Hope that responds to your question, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Great, thank you very much. Talk to you soon. Operator : You next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open. Vedula Murti : I wanted to make sure I understood, because there's a line item and I just want to make sure you can explain it to me. Can you explain to me what kind of how the rabbi trust works kind of how its funded, it's duration and kind of how it replicate itself over supplies? Gale Klappa : Sure. We'll be happy to take a stab at it. I'm going to let Scott do that. I will say this we have to make sure that all of you don't look at the rabbi trust in isolation. As in many ways, the rabbi trust is -- the earnings in the rabbi trust offset the cost of some of our benefit plans. And I think conceptually that's an important point to remember. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes, that's exactly right Gale. So the rabbi trust is really set up by Integrys and we inherited that investment vehicle. And that is related to some of the deferred compensation that individuals from Integrys have earned through the years. So what's a rabbi trust does is what we do is we try to match the best we can, the expense of deferred comp that's in the utilities with the investments in this rabbi trust. So if the rabbi trust goes up $1, usually the deferred comp expense goes up $1 or vice versa. So it's really trying to match that. We have those funds. They're tied up specifically for the deferred comp, so there's nothing else we can use for them. So we have to do it and we thought the best thing to do was try to mirror and match the hedging as much as possible. Like Gail said though, you can't look at it in isolation. Just for accounting purposes, it has to be on this line how it\u2019s recorded. Gale Klappa : And Vedula, so far and again we've inherited that in 2015 with the Integrys acquisition. So far our strategies, our matching strategy, if you will, has our matching strategy, if you will, is worked exceptionally well. Vedula Murti : So as I think about this, is the variance here tied to stock market performance, performance of Wisconsin Equity, Wisconsin Energy, the equity specifically? Or what creates the variances, both up and down in this? Gale Klappa : And again, we'll let Scott give you more detail. But long story short, we know what investment options are people who've got the deferred comp are in. In other words, we know what investment options they have selected. We can blend that with our investment options in the rabbi trust. Scott Lauber : And a lot of the investment options are dealing with equities in the deferred comp, and that's what we're trying to match it the best we can. It's not perfect. But the best we can with equities in the rabbi trust. And so far the correlation has been pretty high\u2026 Gale Klappa : 99% and really good\u2026 Vedula Murti : And so this is a static thing going forward, there's no new participants or incremental? Gale Klappa : No new participant\u2026 Scott Lauber : It's static and it slowly goes down as participants withdraw from the old Integrys deferred comp. So it's slowly going down. Vedula Murti : And I guess also I guess then the other thing, obviously, this is clearly part of strategies in terms of the income tax expense line in terms of the wind credits and everything like that. Clearly, if we take a look at Page 10, say major, that's a very important positive factor and year-over-year is very large increase. How should we be thinking about that in terms of within the earnings guidance range variance going forward there? Gale Klappa : We can certainly give you the comparison of what we achieved in terms of the infrastructure segment earnings in 2019 versus our projection in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the infrastructure segment gave us about $0.02 a share uptick in earnings each quarter during 2019. And with the addition of Coyote Ridge Wind Farm in South Dakota, which went commercial at the end of last year and will give us a full year this year, we would expect $0.03 a quarter from the infrastructure investments in wind. Scott Lauber : Yes. And I think overall when you look at it, including the unprotected we're giving back in the credits to our customers, that effective tax rate is in that 16% to 17% range. Gale Klappa : And to clarify, what's going to be an incremental penny a quarter in 2020 in terms of the earnings. Vedula Murti : So given the fully diluted share count, it would appear then that that variance should be something similar not as dramatic year-over-year? Gale Klappa : Yes, that's exactly right. Operator : And your next question comes from Andrew Levi with Exoduspoint. Andrew Levi : So just kind of following Michael Weinstein's question, and just on kind of natural gas, I guess -- and you kind of answered it already. But I would say just in the context of ESG and obviously, ESG is not to be favoring natural gas. So maybe just explain how you with that? And then separately, I agree with everything that you have said earlier about nat gas. Just kind of looking at kind of the last step and if you look at LDCs or companies that are very heavy natural gas, their stocks have not done as well of lately and the multiples have come down. And so I'm just wondering kind of where your head is at? And at the right price, would you add gas distribution customers to your mix beyond what you have already obviously in the large LDC in Illinois and the smaller ones in Wisconsin? Gale Klappa : Well, good question, Andy. You know you never say never, but let me put it this way. At the right price, obviously, hitting the free that we've talked about for acquisitions, and we would always take a hard look. I would go because you recognized if you're making an acquisition of any kind of company, LDC or not, you are basically making a very long-term bet. Our assets, as you know, are very long-lived assets. So would, and I'm saying this just theoretically. If an LDC in the Northern North Dakota came up for sale at the right price, we probably would be a lot more interested in that than if it was in the San Diego. Andrew Levi : And just as far as ESG and how you kind of think maybe, obviously, it's an evolving idea or investment basis. Do you think as far as natural gas, they've gone for an update but it may not be the right way to look at it and there are other things to focus on the ESG side? Gale Klappa : Well, again a good question, Andy. My sense and we've done dozens of ESG business. Right now, and I think for the foreseeable future, the ESG focus infrastructure companies like ours, seems to be heavily, heavily focused on CO2 emissions and what your plan is to basically decarbonize the generation fleet. That swamps any other kind of discussion that we have had with any ESG-oriented investor. And again, we have hundreds of these discussions over the course of the last couple years. In fact, everyone now, whether you are ESG focused or not, everyone is beginning to ask ESG questions. But I would say that in 99 out of 100 meetings, the real focus is really on CO2 emissions and there we've got a great story to tell. The other thing that I would point out, we're one of the first utilities in the country to set a methane reduction goal. And I think you are going to be seeing, because the climate scientists, as you know, really believe that methane emissions are far, far more potent perhaps 25 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, I think you are going to be seeing some increasing focus on methane emissions and they are the kind of upgrade work we're doing to modernize the natural gas distribution network, particularly in Chicago is really important. So those are the kinds of -- that's the flavor of what we're hearing in our ESG business today, Andy. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : So let me ask you something here, just to follow up on Vedula's question. The rabbi trust, if I understand your answers, basically is offset by deferred comp expense to do really isn't any net income benefit of any significance you see driving earnings going forward or in terms of results for 2019. Am I understanding it correctly? Gale Klappa : Correct. 2019 may have been an anomaly because we have so much O&M coming out of the utility that we're into the sharing. But for the most part, there's no benefit from that at all. But it would have been a small amount, and nothing Paul that we're planning on in terms of benefit for 2020. Paul Patterson : And then in terms of Foxconn, there's some local articles about the Foxconn administration, looking at renegotiating the tax benefits, because of I guess the way the Foxconn thing has been sort of rolling out. And I'm just wondering if you had anything to share on that, or what does that mean in terms of the outlook for the Foxconn economic development contributions that you guys have been expecting past this? Gale Klappa : And let me let me just reiterate first what I mentioned in our prepared remarks. In that over the past two years, Foxconn has invested already over $500 million in Wisconsin. I can tell you, again, I've said before focus on what's going on the campus rather than the media reports. But I can tell you, I was actually with the governor yesterday. He and I appeared together at an economic development conference here in Milwaukee. And he went out of his way to say that he believes his responsibility is to help make Foxconn successful in Wisconsin. So again, that's as of 9 :30 yesterday morning and a very definitive comment from the governor himself. Paul Patterson : And then finally the wind transaction with Google as the off-take, that's for the life of the project. Is that correct? Gale Klappa : So that would be a 12 year off-take agreement. Paul Patterson : That's 12 years, okay. And then just speaking, given the credit quality of Google and stuff, just to make sure I understand this, that's a better rate of return that you're getting. You guys perceived -- you guys expect to get a better return associated with that project than what you're getting in a regulated business. Do I understand you guys right in that? Gale Klappa : You understand this absolutely correctly. And the experience that we've had so far with the other infrastructure investments that are operational experienced in 2019 is proving that out. Paul Patterson : Okay, awesome. Thanks so much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Thanks for the call. All right. Well, folks, that concludes our long conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, we're always available. Please contact Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Take care everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference calls. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2020 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I'll remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for the opening quarter of 2020. I certainly hope that you and your families are all doing well and staying healthy. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are on the call with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO and Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer. Now, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $1.43 a share, a strong performance despite lower natural gas demand during a mild first quarter. The result underscores our focus on operating efficiently and executing our capital investment plan. Scott will discuss our metrics in more detail a bit later in the call. Of course, as we plan for the long-term success of our company, we're also focused on providing essential service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As you would expect the health of our employees and communities remains our top priority. We've adopted numerous measures to minimize health risks and instill in our employees the importance of following the CDC guidelines. Stay at home orders, as many of you know were issued across our four states in late-March. Keep in mind that the full effect of the virus hit Wisconsin and Illinois relatively late. And the hardest hit parts of Michigan are outside of our service area. Given that timing, we saw only a minimal impact from the pandemic on our first quarter results. I\u2019d also like to point out that we took action to further control costs even before the virus struck. The first quarter happened to be one of the warmest on record of the past century. When we saw mild weather at the beginning of January, we set the wheels in motion to reduce expenses in areas of our business that would not affect safety, reliability or customer satisfaction. Now stepping back, as we look more broadly at our business mix, approximately 38% of our pre-tax margin for the full year comes from our natural gas delivery business across our four state area. Also, a third of our earnings for the full year typically come in the first quarter. So with a strong start to the year, we're about as well-positioned as we can be to deal with the uncertainties ahead. Many of you have also asked about the status of the major economic development projects that have been announced in our region. The short answer is Rock On. A good example is the high-tech campus that Foxconn is building south of Milwaukee. The Gen 6 fabrication plant for LCD panels is fully enclosed now, and internal build out is underway. Smart manufacturing facility is also taking shape, with production of components for enterprise servers and racks expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, the external structure for Foxconn's Network Operation Center is being erected as we speak. And to help fight the pandemic, Foxconn and Medtronic have announced that Foxconn will produce a line of Medtronic ventilators in our state starting this summer. Obviously, we're keeping a close eye on local economic trends and customer demand for energy. Based on what we're seeing today, I do not expect any diminution in our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% a year. With minor adjustments our $15 billion capital plan remains on track. I'd like to highlight one area of that capital plan that is progressing well ahead of schedule. That's our Energy Infrastructure segment. You may have seen the announcement that we're increasing our ownership interest from 80% to 90% in the Blooming Grove, Thunderhead and Upstream Wind Farms. Pending all regulatory approvals, we plan to invest another $118 million for an additional 75 megawatts of capacity. A focus for our infrastructure segment, we've now committed over 40% of the total in our five year plan, and that plan just began in January. In short, our overall capital plan is low risk and highly executable. We have ample liquidity, no need to issue new equity. In fact, our available liquidity at the end of April has risen to $2.6 billion. And finally, I'd like to cover one other positive development from the first quarter. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the next important steps in our succession planning process. We're very pleased with Scott Lauber, will become our Chief Operating Officer effective June 1. In his new role, Scott will have senior oversight responsibility for power generation, like infrastructure and fuels, information technology, supply chain, supplier diversity and major projects. He also will be named President of Michigan Gas Utilities and Minnesota Energy Resources, and he will continue to serve as he has, as a member of the Office of the Chair. We're also welcoming, as you\u2019ve heard a new addition to the team, Xia Liu will be joining the company as our new Chief Financial Officer, effective June 1. So I'm sure, you know Xia most recently served in the same capacity at CenterPoint Energy. Xia brings a tremendous amount of depth and experience to the new role. She began her industry career at Southern Company as a financial analyst back in 1998. During her career, she also served as the Chief Financial Officer of two Southern Company subsidiaries, Golf Power, and Georgia Power, and as the Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer for Southern Company. Xia, will also be a member of our Office of the Chair. These new appointments will bring additional depth and experience to an already strong leadership team, a team that as you know, has delivered exceptional results over many, many years. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for details on our first quarter operations. Kevin, all yours. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by highlighting the work of our dedicated employees, who are providing safe and reliable service throughout this health crisis. We've sharply curtailed work inside customer\u2019s homes, and 80% of our employees are now working remotely or in the field. Our employees are adapting to these changes using technology, following health precautions and continuing to work efficiently. The remote work that's making our company safer would not have been possible without our recent technology investments. Although, we still have a long road ahead of us, I'm encouraged by the processes and procedures we have put in place across our companies. Our incident management team and occupational health and support services employees have been instrumental in executing our business continuity plans and developing new processes to address changing conditions. We\u2019re working hard to support our customers through this crisis, and I'm grateful that we've also been able to contribute through our foundations to organizations on the front lines, including Local [indiscernible], hospitals, domestic violence shelters, food pantries and youth programs. Through these donations and matching gifts, we're providing more than $2 million to COVID-19 relief efforts. It's our way of thanking the people and organizations that sustain our communities. Despite these challenges we continue to make progress on key initiatives. Importantly, we have no active rate cases at this time, which is a real positive in our current environment. As you may know, the pandemic has made it necessary to stop disconnections and place a moratorium on new late payment charges for customers. Our regulators have been supportive and we're working through the specific mechanisms for future recovery. In Wisconsin, the Public Service Commission has made it clear that we are authorized to defer foregone late payment charges, uncollectable expense and incremental pandemic related costs. To be clear, this covers all related expenses in our residential as well as our commercial and industrial sectors. Turning now to our projects, we're on track to add utility scale solar generation to our portfolio. You may recall that we\u2019ve already broken ground on two solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, which will provide us with 200 megawatts of capacity. Our Two Creeks Solar Project remains on time to begin producing energy by the end of this year. Our Badger Hollow I Solar project is experiencing a modest delay, but we'll continue to earn allowance for funds used during construction. And we expect it to be operational by the end of April, 2021 in time for the MISO capacity auction. In February, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved our investment in Badger Hollow II. Once complete, the solar park will provide We Energies with 100 megawatts of renewable capacity. We expect to invest $130 million in this project. And I'm sure that many of you\u2019ve heard that the Democratic National Convention has moved from July to August. We've completed a thorough review of our network in preparation for the potential influx of delegates, and overall, we're in very good shape. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you very much. As we look to the remainder of the year, our earnings guidance for 2020 stands at $3.71 to $3.75 a share. As I mentioned earlier, our actions today that put us in a very good position to achieve those results. So today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2020. Again our guidance stands at $3.71 to $3.75 a share. Also, a quick reminder about our dividend. In January, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $63.25 a share, that's an increase of 7.2% over the previous quarterly rate. We continue to target a payout ratio as we've mentioned often of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're in the middle of that range right now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now, with details on our first quarter results and more information on our outlook for the remainder of 2020, here is our CFO and about to be COO; Scott Lauber. Scott? Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Our 2020 first quarter earnings of $1.43 per share increased $0.10 per share compared to the first quarter of 2019. This result was driven by our continued emphasis on cost control, a modest rate increase at our Wisconsin utilities and additional capital investment. We estimate that the mild winter weather conditions accounted for a $0.10 drag on the first quarter earnings compared to last year. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of the first quarter 2020 and 2019 results. I\u2019ll first focus on operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 8 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2020 was $627 million, compared to operating income of $543 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of $84 million. After adjusting for the impact of the 2019 tax repairs, operating income increased by $43 million. My segment update will focus on the remaining $43 million increase in operating income, which excludes the 2019 tax repair benefit. At a Wisconsin segment, adjusted operating income increased $25 million. This was driven by several factors. First, operating and maintenance expense decreased $41 million, largely due to savings from the retirement of the Presque Isle power plant a year ago, additional cost control measures and lower benefit cost. Second, our Wisconsin segment margins were $5.8 million lower. This factored in our recent rate order as well as positive fuel recovery. These positive drivers were more than offset by $41.2 million negative weather variants. And finally, depreciation expense increased $8.1 million as we continue to execute on our capital plan. In Illinois, operating income increased $23.7 million, driven by $19.7 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense net of riders. This is driven by lower repair and maintenance work due to milder winter temperatures, lower benefit cost and cost control. Operating income at our other state segment decreased $4.1 million, due to the mild first quarter. Turning now to our energy infrastructure segment. Operating income at this segment was down $1.2 million. As expected, Bishop Hill, Upstream and Coyote Ridge did not provide a material impact on operating income. Recall, that a significant portion of earnings from these wind farms come in the form of production tax credits, which are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. With Coyote Ridge coming online late last year, these protection tax credits contributed approximately $0.03 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $0.02 in the first quarter of 2019. Combining these changes and excluding the impact of 2019 tax repairs, operating income increased $43 million. Earnings for our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.8 million, an increase of $3.7 million. Higher earnings were driven by continued capital investment. Recall, that our investment is now earning a return on equity of 10.38%. This is per the November 2019 FERC rule. Other income net decreased by $25.3 million, mainly driven by investment losses related to our deferred benefit plans. These investment losses were partially offset the lower benefit expense noted in our operating segments. Interest expense increased $5 million, primarily driven by incremental long-term debt issuances at the subsidiary level to fund our capital investment program. Our consolidated income tax expense net of -- the 2019 tax repairs decreased $15.7 million. Lower tax expense was driven by the positive tax effect of refunding, unprotected tax benefits following our recent Wisconsin rates decision. This year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Excluding the flow back of the unprotected benefits, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. Currently, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projection show that we'll be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. At this time, I'd like to address our sales and earnings forecast for the balance of 2020. Based upon what we have seen in April, we are adjusting our 2020 sales forecast. Specifically, on the electric side, our forecast now assumes a 4% increase in residential sales volumes in the second quarter, trending to an increase of 0.5% by the fourth quarter. For small commercial industrial customers, we are assuming an 8% reduction in the second quarter trending to a reduction of 3% for the fourth quarter. And finally, for our large commercial industrial customers, we are assuming an 18% reduction in the second quarter, trending to a reduction of 7% by the fourth quarter. Overall, based on these assumptions, we are forecasting the total retail electric volumes, excluding the iron ore mine to decrease by approximately 5% for the remaining nine months, compared to our original forecast. These revised volumes translate to a reduction of approximately $70 million to $80 million in pre-tax margin for the year. We believe that we have the ability to absorb this margin compression through temporary initiatives, as well as multiple cost savings and efficiency measures across the enterprise. As Gale stated earlier, these initiatives will not compromise our commitment to safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. So we are confident and reaffirming our annual guidance of $3.71 to $3.75 per share. Given that the stay at home orders are still in place in our region, we are providing second quarter 2020 guidance of $0.58 per share to $0.62 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. In last year's second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share. We've obviously projected declining sales volumes, and there are timing differences related to fuel cost recovery. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll, Shahriar. How are you today? Shahriar Pourreza : Oh, not too bad. How you doing? Gale Klappa : Yes. We're hunkered down doing well. Shahriar Pourreza : That's great to hear. So a couple of questions. You touched on this a bit in your prepared remarks Gale. But can you give us a little bit more color and a high-level, how you're sort of thinking about the duration of the downturn? How long are you thinking the recovery is going to take? And maybe just talk about, a little bit about the sustainability of your levers this downturn is more protracted, right? So any risks to the 5% growth, any CapEx opportunities that become maybe secondary in nature, if this downturn is more projected than your own internal planning assumptions? Gale Klappa : Well, great question Shahriar. Let me first say that I think we have been appropriately conservative in terms of our view of how quick recovery might take place, and what the extent of the recovery would be in the near-term. Scott covered with you our base assumptions in terms of sales declines. My sense is that if in the region, we can get the economy restarted by June, that things will evolve in fits and starts. As I mean, clearly as you know, two-thirds of the economy is driven by consumer demand. I think the real question for everybody is, how confident will the consumer be in going back to their semi-normal buying patterns. Having said all of that, I mean, I think we're appropriately conservative in terms of what we expect to happen to our electric and gas sales volumes. We're confident in our levers and in the dozens and dozens of initiatives that we have across the enterprise to become even more efficient. We're learning things here, as 80% of our workforces is operating remotely, if you will. So we feel very good about our ability to drive additional efficiency and cost reductions throughout the business. And we're prepared obviously to pivot either way, if the recovery is quicker then that\u2019s all to the benefit, but I think we have been appropriately conservative. In terms of the capital plan, when you think about the elements of our capital plan, they are really all about reliability. So, I don\u2019t see any really need or for that matter, I still see the need to continue of that capital plan focused on reliability and improved customer service. The infrastructure segment will be unaffected, as best I can tell. And so long story short, we really don\u2019t see any threat right now to our long-term earnings growth rate projection of 5% to 7% a year. I hope Shahriar that responds. Shahriar Pourreza : No, it does. And I just wanted to confirm then and your conservative bend does always comes to light. So thank you for that. Let me just -- since you touched on the infrastructure segment, are you seeing this economic dislocation short of -- is it driving any new opportunities in that segment? I mean you're well ahead of filling that capital budget. Are any developers facing any cash crunches, people looking to get out of projects, especially given you have an - obviously an advantage with your tax appetite? So can you have a [contra] [ph] effect where the -- what you're seeing in the economy actually play into the hands of your -- of that segment? Gale Klappa : I would say it's a little too early to give you a definitive answer, but the early indications are yes, that there will be some additional high-quality projects. And remember, we are very particular about the kind of projects we're willing to take on in the infrastructure segment. But I would say that, given the sharp contraction on the economy, given the fact that some folks obviously need cash, I think we're going to see more opportunity. We will be very selective, though, as we work through that opportunity. But I do think there will be additional projects that we will take a hard look at. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. And then just lastly, can you just remind us if ATC receives a Transco adder? And if so, do you have any thoughts yet on the recent FERC NOPR proposal to remove? As we kind of understand it, it would be kind of a wash if they increase the RTO membership added by 50 bps. So how - are we sort of thinking about this correctly? Gale Klappa : I think so. Although, I believe that one of the proposals and Scott and Kevin can echo me on this, I think one of the proposals is for there to be a 100 basis point adder for RTO participation. Right now, essentially ATC is getting a 50 basis point adder. So there's a possibility there, Scott, I think of another 50 basis points in the mix. Scott Lauber : Yes, that's exactly correct from what I'm reading right now. So there's potential there. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Well, thanks so much guys. And congrats, Scott and Xia on the new rolls, and I'm sure Xia will get a little bit more rest at night [indiscernible]. So congrats guys. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Scott Lauber : Hey Shahriar, I'm a night owl. So don't count on that. Shahriar Pourreza : I know that. You guys, congrats. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from our Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Durgesh. How you\u2019re doing? Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Gale. Doing great. Good afternoon, rather. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have a two into the weeds question, so I'll apologize upfront. The first one, as I understand, I see the $13.5 million in Wisconsin segment on Slide 8 that is, the $13.5 million decline in fuel savings. As I understand it, you were allowed to retain roughly $15 million versus your authorized demand, any fuel savings that you might have? Can you just comment on what of that $15 million, if any, have you utilized in the first quarter? Gale Klappa : I think virtually, all of it, because of the timing of fuel recovery, Scott? Scott Lauber : Correct. This is a $13.5 million better in the first quarter. And once again, it's a lot of it due to the timing of the fuel recoveries. As you recall historically, there's a pattern of the fuel recoveries at Wisconsin Electric, that you usually over collect in the first and second quarters, under collect in the third and then swings back in the fourth quarter. And we just really had some positive fuel recoveries with the price of natural gas and our operating fuel cost in the first quarter. So we are ahead of the plan in this first quarter, specifically, compared to last year and compared to our original guidance that we set. Gale Klappa : So Durgesh, what that really means is, you won't see as big a pickup in Q2, because we\u2019ve really eaten the full amount into Q1, because of again, of the timing and the collapse of oil and gas prices. Scott Lauber : Exactly. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's what I thought. And then just maybe, Scott, any additional color on the other O&M category, the $22.3 million, what is that made up off? And how is that tracking perhaps versus your original guidance? Scott Lauber : Yes. So the other O&M and what we did is we broke it out, because we've talked about this before, the offset of some of that deferred compensation is in the Rabbi Trust. So this O&M is really the day-to-day savings that we're seeing from the multitude of operating savings across the footprint. And this is specifically what's related to the majority of its what related to Wisconsin segment and there's more in Illinois and in the smaller utilities also. So that's the day-to-day stuff. Durgesh Chopra : Okay, perfect. Thank you, Scott, and congratulations. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good afternoon. I appreciate it, you guys taking the time. Perhaps, let me take this as a couple clarification commentary perhaps a little bit of step forward. When you're thinking about the cost reductions to offset, I think you talked about $70 million, $80 million of pre-tax here. How do you think about the sustainability that into '21? And then subsequently, how do you think about this meshing into the regulatory process at large in Wisconsin? I'll leave it open ended. There's a lot of ways you could interpret that. Gale Klappa : Okay. Well, in terms of sustainability, let me just go back and talk for a second about our track record. As you may recall, our day-to-day -- what we call our day-to-day operation and maintenance costs, we reduced those by 7.3% in 2019 over 2018. Our forecast and plan for this year was an additional 2% to 3% reduction over and above what we achieved in 2019. And now, we have put in, as we mentioned, I mean literally hundreds of measures across the enterprise. We're learning some things here in terms of additional possibilities for long-term sustainable cost reduction through what we've been forced to operate through the pandemic here. So costs I believe, are going to come down. I would just point to our track record of sustainable cost reductions to give you some confidence that a big chunk of what we're seeing here, I think will be sustainable. And of course, that not only benefits, the efficiency and the operation of the business, but also over the long-term benefits customers. Because it takes pressure off retail rates, and allows us to continue without pressure on retail rates, the kinds of important reliability investments that we're making in our $15 billion capital plan. Kevin, Scott, anything else you'd like to add? Kevin Fletcher : Gale, this is Kevin. Let me first say, I'm extremely proud of what our employees are doing and how they\u2019ve rallied during this COVID virus epidemic. But Gale, you just mentioned that we're looking at day-in and day-out what we can do to be more effective and more efficient, and we're finding a lot of those opportunities. And as you said, I believe they will be sustainable as we move forward. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Kevin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then if I can follow-up just quickly. Strategically, I know you talked about the infrastructure opportunities a moment ago. But how do you think about the landscape today as it stands? We've heard folks kind of backing away broadly from strategic opportunities, given the backdrop of late, but obviously, there's been a lot of valuations in relative valuations, et cetera. How do you think about the opportunity today more holistically and beyond that infrastructure? Gale Klappa : So, you're specifically asking about Julien, opportunities in the infrastructure segment. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I was thinking beyond that, really. I know you just made comments about robust set of opportunities on the infrastructure side. But I'm thinking strategically beyond that more corporate level? Gale Klappa : Well, good question. And I think the answer will be boringly repetitive, because we have a set of criteria, as you know, that we use to look at any potential strategic or acquisition opportunity. And I'll just repeat them quickly, so we put everybody to sleep. But these are important, at least in my judgment. Following these criteria, in our sector, in our industry, I think, if you can follow these criteria and actually execute on them, I think you create shareholder value. If you don't, then I think the story gets a little bit more muddy. So our really set in stone criteria are, we would have to believe that anything we would acquire, will be a creative in the first full year after closing. We're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it, we worked very hard to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we\u2019re not going to make something accretive by thrashing the balance sheet. And then thirdly, and I think Julien, this would be the gating question right now, as we look at the landscape, we\u2019d have to believe that the growth rate of anything that we would acquire would have to be as strong as our own organic growth rate or stronger. Read that 5% to 7% earnings per share growth a year, that right now, would be I think the biggest gating question for us, as we look at anything around the landscape. I hope that responds to your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Absolutely. Thank you for the time guys, and do well. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey, Gale. Good afternoon. Just maybe a little bit more color on sales, particularly if you have data for the month of April. If what it overall sales do and by class, so we have an idea? Gale Klappa : Let me -- yes, we do have April data, happy to share it with you. Last time we chatted, I mentioned to you that we're also looking day-to-day at the MISO Midwest operator data for the 14 States in the broad, middle swathe of the country. So if you look at from March 24th, which was the date of the announcement of the stay at home order in Wisconsin, through May 2, basically kilowatt hours send out in the MISO footprint was down just over 8%. We've consistently day-to-day done a little bit better than that. And I think through the same dates, March 24 through May 2, we're down right around 7%. So we've consistently done day-in, day-out, a bit better than what we're seeing across the MISO footprint. And we are seeing an uptick pretty significantly in residential usage. Scott, would you like to talk about that? Scott Lauber : Yes. So, we are looking at our residential usage. And like we've done before, we track our entire system and our large customers in residential, using our automatic meter reading. And really looking at the data, we are seeing anywhere to at least 5% plus and some weeks on the residential usage. So when we put our forecast together, looking at 4% is more of a realistic estimate to be a little conservative. And as you go through the customer classes, the large commercial and customers that we look at and we track as the 17 major segments that we're looking at in our area, and we get reports weekly on it. And we're seeing between 16% and 18% down there, and that's what we factored into our guidance here in the second quarter. And then the third segment is really that small commercial area that we're seeing down probably about 6% to 8%. So that's how we factored it in. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That was it for me. I appreciate it. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Scott Lauber : You're welcome, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings. Michael, how are you today? Michael Weinstein : I'm doing okay, Gale. Thank you very much. Congratulations Scott and Xia. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Michael Weinstein : On the $7 million to $8 million reduction in sales, now that's based on second quarter being the worst it is and things getting better throughout the year. Can you kind of ballpark where things might be if, let's say the second quarter turns out to be like the whole year, turns out to be in the second quarter, you know the third and fourth quarter as well same kind of reductions? Gale Klappa : We're doing a little meatball math here, as we think about responding appropriately to your question. Scott Lauber : Yes. So if you would take that second quarter trended out and carry the whole year, that may be another $10 million to $15 million. And that's, the ballpark number we've been thinking about here, if that would be the case scenario. I mean, once again, we're seeing things start up and then kind of go back down and we anticipate as the stay at home orders start to open up, we'll see some movement here. But we do have those kinds of bookends here and we're watching it every day. Gale Klappa : I think Scott is exactly right. As we've done our sensitivities, even if the second quarter became the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I think we're still under a $100 million in terms of pre-tax margin loss. Michael Weinstein : The summer time has already been factored in this? Gale Klappa : Yes. Yes, absolutely. Michael Weinstein : Right. And also, is it apply to both electric and gas customers now that gas would be much of a factor? I\u2019m curious if it's only electric. Gale Klappa : Yes. No, we factored in both gas and electric. I would remind you, though, that the second and third quarters for gas deliveries are very minimal. Our big quarters, obviously are the heating seasons, so, Q1 and Q4 for natural gas. But we have factored in. And again, I mean our natural gas deliveries were largely unaffected by the pandemic in Q1. But we have factored in some reduction in Q4, assuming the world is not back to total normal for gas deliveries. Kevin Fletcher : Gale, I\u2019d add too, in my prepared remarks, and we still are expecting the Democratic National Convention to come here. And if it does and the markets open up, then there will be a lot of kilowatt hour usage during that summer period as well which will help. Michael Weinstein : I think I missed this before, I heard something about regulatory treatments for COVID-19 expenses. Right now, you have residential escrow accounting in Wisconsin and a Rider in Illinois for at least for bad debt. Are there any other mechanisms being discussed or contemplated? Gale Klappa : Yes. First of all, the Wisconsin commission was the first in the country to basically set up a regulatory mechanism. We are being asked, all the Wisconsin utilities are being asked to track and defer direct additional expenses related to response to the COVID pandemic number, one. And number two, since we've all agreed not to disconnect any customers during the pandemic, we're going to be allowed to defer and track for future potential recovery, any late fees that we cannot levy and resulting bad debt. But as you say, for Wisconsin, we already have escrow accounting for residential bad debt. And then you pop to Illinois, there's a docket underway right now. In fact, there are dockets really underway in each of the four states. The next for this along would probably be Illinois, where again, no disconnects, no new late fee payments. And the commission there is going to ramp up that docket sometime in the next few weeks. But I\u2019d remind you, that we are decoupled in its natural gas delivery only in Illinois, and we are decoupled in Illinois. So that's obviously helpful as well. Scott, anything to add? Scott Lauber : And in Illinois also, there was already in place collection of bad debt expense for both residential and commercial industrial in Illinois. So that's already in place. Gale Klappa : There's a bill rider that's historically been in place there. Michael Weinstein : Just my curiosity, I know that Amazon Development Center and warehouse [ph] right, it just got started up recently, just time. Is that seeing any kind of maybe ramped up activity that beyond that you were expecting or any plans for doing something more there? Gale Klappa : Matter of fact, yes. There's another site that Amazon is looking at right now in one of the suburbs. That would be their site for same-day delivery. That's going through citing an approval process right now, but it's an existing warehouse. And my understanding is it's about 400,000 square feet. So yes, Amazon is actively looking at potential expansion here as well. Michael Weinstein : Thank you very much, guys. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Andrew. How are you today? Andrew Weisel : Hey, everyone. I\u2019m good. How are you guys? Gale Klappa : We're good. Andrew Weisel : First a question for Gale. What would you say the odds are of the NBA resuming the season? Gale Klappa : Great question. Here's what I can tell you. The league very much wants to resume. They've talked about even potentially restarting a part of the season as late as August. But I think there's a very strong desire on behalf of the league to in some way shape or form get to a meaningful playoff. Now, having said that, my own personal guess is if that does happen, it would be a broadcast only event without fans in the stands. But if I were a betting man, I would say odds are better than 50-50 that there will be some resumption of the current NBA season, even if it means a delay in starting the next season. Andrew Weisel : All right, I hope so, as much as I love reading about utilities, I do miss sports. Gale Klappa : Yes. And if you're a partial owner of the Bucks and they win the championship, you might get a ring. This would be pretty cool. Andrew Weisel : Alright. So, next question. On the first quarter weather, I see the earnings package shows a roughly $45 million hit year-over-year. What would that be versus normal? Scott Lauber : Oh, gosh, it is about $0.07, compared to normal. So about $28 million, $29 million. Gale Klappa : Yes. $28 million to $30 million. Scott Lauber : Yeah. Andrew Weisel : Okay. So, in terms of the cost savings you mentioned you're going to start to look for some stuff, or you started to look in January. You're saying roughly $70 million to $80 million from the coronavirus and roughly $30 million from weather versus normal. Is that right? And that compares to your guidance of 2% to 3%, which would be roughly $25 million to $35 million? Did I get those numbers about right? Gale Klappa : Yes, you're in the ballpark. Absolutely. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. Then can you -- going back as you guys have generally been there for quite some time. Can you go back to 2008, 2009 and remind us of how much you were able to identify as far as incremental cost savings during that downturn? Gale Klappa : Oh, good lord. Are you trying to say Andrew, we're old? Is that the question? Andrew Weisel : I'm saying you\u2019re consistent. Gale Klappa : Well, I don't remember the specific number on O&M savings, but I can tell you this. Industrial energy usage during 2009 dropped by 10% compared to 2008. And small commercial and industrial got devastated as well. There was no real uptick like we're seeing now in residential. So I would say actually, based on our '09 experience and my memory, what we had to accomplish in terms of cost reductions and additional efficiency in '09 was probably as great or greater than what we're looking at potentially today. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. No, Gale, you're exactly right. And '08, '09 was a little different period there. But, once again, we executed and we achieved our earnings guidance and we earned our returns on our utilities. Gale Klappa : I think a part of this is our general operating philosophy. I mean, when you focus as a mantra and as a management focus day-in day-out on the fundamentals and executing the fundamentals, as efficiently as you can, it really gives you good insight into where you can drive an additional reductions, additional cost control, additional efficiency, both short-term and long-term. I think one of the factors that I would cite for our success is really every day, we try to get better at the fundamentals of our business. And that's really the focus of what our operating teams do every day. So I think that's a big factor. Understanding exactly what's driving your costs and understanding exactly, not just top down bottom up as well on how we can get better every day. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. Then one last one, if I may. On liquidity, I believe you said $2.6 billion as of a few days ago. That's up quite a bit from the end of March or yearend. Can you remind us what you've done to bolster that? And the way you see the world today, do you think you're done in terms of capital raises for the year? Gale Klappa : Scott, I\u2019ll let you handle that one. Scott Lauber : So actually, the cash flow has been positive so far. And we did issue a small debt at our small utilities about $110 million that helps with the liquidity. Overall, MERC/MGU in total it was $110 million. So we will still have some issuances through remaining of the year, as we look at financing now that we have multiple items in the infrastructure segment, we'll be looking at that and also potentially some holding company debt. So we're evaluating it right now and looking at the timing, but the rates are coming down a little, so that looks good. But right now the additional liquidity was good cash flow and additional debt at the smaller utilities. Andrew Weisel : Great. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Jeremy, how are you? Jeremy Tonet : Good. Thanks for having me. I think you've touched on industrial and specifically Foxconn activity at the start of the call here. But just wondering, if you could share anymore color on current and expected industrial activity going forward here? And I guess if you see the potential for any lingering impacts from the whole COVID-19 situation on post-2020 industrial level? Gale Klappa : Well, the honest answer is, we don't know. I mean, until we see how the consumer comes out of this shutdown of the economy, it's really almost impossible to tell overall. But, having said that, every one of the major economic development expansion projects that we've announced in the last two years are as I mentioned, as Foxconn is a good example, are rocking and rolling and going forward with the same commitment. In fact, one of the -- and I won't mention their name because it's not public yet, but one of the major announcements we've made in the economic development front about a year and a half ago, we've just learned the footprint is going to be even larger. So that's one of the reasons why I don't see a diminution in our long-term growth rate. We've got major capital projects on the way, and I will tell you in terms of customer growth, customer expansion. The other thing I will tell you on the more optimistic or even more optimistic side, I already believe that we're going to see a reshaping of the supply chains, with much more productivity and much more production coming into the U.S. I think one of the lessons that everybody has learned is nothing against China, but we can't be dependent on Chinese production for all of the antibiotics that are prescribed in the U.S. or the great majority of them. I think you're going to see a reshaping of the supply chain. Again, with more production coming in the U.S. over the next few years, and Wisconsin will be particularly well suited to take advantage of that in my view. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. Thanks. And just one more if I could. I'm just wondering if you see COVID impacting the timing of pipe replacement in Illinois, kind of both from a rate increase perspective and an economic development perspective. Gale Klappa : Well, I will say this, given the stay at home orders, we have shifted a little bit in Illinois some of the pipe replacement work and actually to very much to our benefit and customers' benefit. So the plan was to really upgrade the piping systems in a number of neighborhoods starting in the first quarter. Now, though, the Chicago loop is deserted, and we were able to get some permits to do work we would have done at a later time, but was on the schedule in the Chicago loop. We are far more productive with that work than you can possibly imagine, because there's simply no traffic and nothing to disrupt the timing of the work. So from the standpoint of actually being even more efficient and getting some work done that eventually, absolutely, had to be done in the Chicago loop, the pandemic has actually been helpful to us in terms of shifting that work. It is slowing down, obviously some of the work in the neighborhoods, but we're really pleased that we've been able to get a real leg up on work in the loop. Kevin, Scott, anything to add to that? Kevin Fletcher : Yes. Gale, I would add, it makes sense, excuse me, Scott, for doing so because as you just mentioned, moving away from the neighborhood. So I'm allowed us to not have as much interaction with going inside the homes, because in addition to the pipe replacement we're also moving meters from inside to outside. So with the COVID-19, we made a decision to minimize that and focus attention where we could be more productive, as you just mentioned. Jeremy Tonet : That's a very helpful color. Thank you. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hey, Gale, glad to hear you and your family are all well. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats to Scott again on his new role within the company's leadership team. Gale Klappa : Hey, Michael, do you think we got to give him a raise? Michael Lapides : No, absolutely not. Not in this environment. Maybe five or seven years from now. We'll talk about that. Gale Klappa : I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Just what I wanted to hear. Michael Lapides : I\u2019ll talk about demand and the revenue impacting around $75 million or so. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about puts and the takes. So in Wisconsin, you had $22 million of O&M benefit. In Illinois, you had almost 20 -- so call it $42 million total. So you're kind of more than halfway to the O&M cost reductions that would offset that demand weakness. Are you saying that that's all the O&M you would take out? Or are you saying that you would take out even more than that, because that\u2019s what the original plan already had? Gale Klappa : Great question, and let\u2019s backup for a minute. Remember, our initial plan embedded in our earnings guidance and our forecast for the year, was a reduction in O&M of 2% to 3%. So some of what you\u2019re quoting for Q1 results really was part of the plan. So when you look at, what we\u2019re talking about here was the $70 million to $80 million projection for our base case in terms of pre-tax margin reduction, and offsets that we expect to achieve through O&M savings. That\u2019s over and above the 2% to 3%. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. So, we had a great first quarter on our O&M control, and that was really needed to offset some of the weather that we had. But the O&M for the rest of the year, we\u2019re going to continue to take cost out as we talked about to achieve that. Michael Lapides : Got it. So I guess my question is, is the total O&M reduction kind of the another 3% to 5% in addition to the original 2% to 3% that you had targeted? Is that kind of the right way? Or maybe it's easier if we just put this in dollar millions and kind of go from there? Gale Klappa : Yes. I think percentage wise you're pretty much on it. Yes. But we'd assume 2% to 3%, then if you add the $70 million to $80 million on top of that, yes, you're in the ballpark. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. And you think kind of a sustainable into 2021 and beyond? I mean, kind of a permanent reduction in O&M, which would obviously go to back to the customer will go tall? Gale Klappa : I'm sorry, you were very muffled there, Michael. I did not catch your question. Michael Lapides : Okay. And you assume some of that is permanent, that incremental O&M reduction, meaning that it would last in the 2021 and beyond? Gale Klappa : Yes, that's exactly correct. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you, Gale. Much appreciate it. And I hope your Bucks are playing soon. Gale Klappa : Yes. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Good afternoon. How are you doing? Gale Klappa : What's you up to today? Anything good, Paul? Paul Patterson : I\u2019m about good. But just to sort of follow-up on a few questions here. You said that the O&M savings, a big chunk of them are sustainable. Could you give a little bit more of a quantification on that? Or if you can't, can you sort of qualify, give us a sense as to where you're seeing the savings longer-term, the longer-term stuff? Gale Klappa : Well, it's a little bit early to give you a precise answer. The $70 million to $80 million of cost savings that we expect to achieve this year on exactly what amount of that is sustainable. But I will tell you that -- and I think this is the case for many of our brethren across the industry. Now that we're having to operate as remotely as we are, and we're doing very well. I mean, as Kevin mentioned earlier, actually our customer satisfaction levels are the highest I've ever seen. And we generally have very high customer satisfaction. And I think our folks have managed to operate very effectively in this environment. So for example -- and we will be shaking this all out as we continue to watch and observe over the course of the rest of the year. But I'll give you one specific example. We're not going to need as many physical facilities as we once thought we would need. And there were some expansion plans on the drawing board. I don't think we're going to need that. I don't believe we're going to need all of them, maybe none of them, but as an example. So we'll see how this goes. But I would just point you back to our track record. I mentioned earlier more than a 7% decline in sustainable O&M reduction, \u201819 over \u201818, a 2% to 3% that we believe was going to be permanent this year. And I think it will be more than that. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then sort of following-up on the question about Illinois and the pipe replacement program. As you know, there was a resolution that passed the city council. And do you think that the changes that you're talking about will ameliorate, I guess their concerns as articulated, I guess in this resolution? Do you follow what I'm saying? I mean, how should we think about that resolution, I guess? Gale Klappa : Well, this was the same resolution that was passed a year ago. So now we're in the second year of the same resolution. For those of you who are not familiar with this, the resolution basically asked the governor to look into the cost and effectiveness of the pipe replacement program. The major concern as we understand it from a few of the council members is affordability. And there's a very, very good answer to that. And that is that if you look at customer bills, customer gas bills in Illinois, starting in the year that this legislation was passed that incentivized utilities in Illinois to accelerate the pipe replacement program, customer bills are actually down. We have not created an affordability crisis in any way shape or form. Once completed, and it's going to take a while, the system will be more efficient, that should be helpful in terms of customer bills. And in addition to that, we have just provided to the Illinois Commerce Commission an independent study from a worldwide internationally known engineering firm, that the Commission asked us to basically take a hard look at the execution of our pipe replacement program. So we've just presented the -- it's called the Kiefner study. You may want to take a look at that. It should be on the Illinois Commerce Commission website, or a summary of it certainly should be. But the bottom line is, the Kiefner study indicated that the aging pipes underneath Chicago have a useful life even shorter than what we had anticipated. And the average useful life remaining according to the Kiefner study is 15 years. So Kiefner, actually recommended in its study to the Illinois Commerce Commission that we accelerate the work to an even greater degree than we're trying to do now. I don't know practically other than a pandemic where you can do a lot more work in a loop. I don't know how practical, significant additional acceleration is. But long story short, there's even more evidence now of the need for the program, number one, verified by an outside international engineering firm. Number two, there is no heating cost crisis compared to when this program started. Paul Patterson : Excellent. Thanks so much for clarifying that. And then just, I know you get the deferral back to Wisconsin. I know you get t deferral on the electric and gas side there due to COVID and everything. But could you just give us a flavor as to what your actual experience is in terms of people paying their bills on time over the last month or so? Or do you have any trends or any data you could share with us in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the bill pay? Gale Klappa : Paul, really nothing yet, in that. Remember, we're under a residential disconnect moratorium in all of our cold weather states, that usually runs through April 15. So we wouldn't have seen any major difference in terms of collectability or disconnections through tax day, normal tax day anyway. So we're really only looking at about a two week period since then. And I don't think the data Scott is meaningful on that two week period. Scott Lauber : No. It's pretty early yet. Normally, we see a little reduction in those remaining two weeks, we saw a small increase, but it's really early yet. So we're watching it very closely like everything else. Paul Patterson : Awesome. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Hang in there. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. You too, Paul. Thank you very much. Well, folks, we really appreciate your questions. That concludes our conference call for today. If you have any additional questions free feel -- I cannot talk anymore. You wore me out here. Feel free to contact Beth Straka, Head of our Investor Relations Group. And she can be reached at 414-221-4639. Thanks, everybody. Stay safe and take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Second Quarter 2020 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I'll remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Hot town, summer in the city. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for the second quarter of 2020. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are on the call with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and Chief Executive, Scott Lauber, our new Chief Operating Officer, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. And please join me in welcoming Xia Liu, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Xia, will discuss our metrics in more detail a little bit later in the call. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2020 earnings of $0.76 a share. We remain optimistic and confident in our ability to create value despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. As always, our focus on operating efficiency was a major factor in our second quarter performance. In addition, warmer than normal weather drove residential energy use significantly higher during the quarter. We also continue to make excellent progress on our $15 billion capital investment plan. If you recall, that plan covers the period 2020 through 2024. As a reminder, we have ample liquidity and no need to issue new equity. Now you may have seen our latest project announcement just last week [indiscernible] to acquire an 85% ownership interest in the Tatanka Ridge wind farm. The Tatanka Ridge is under construction in South Dakota and we expect the project to be in service in early 2021. When complete, the site will consist of 56 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 155 megawatts. Our investment is expected to total approximately $235 million for the 85% ownership interest and substantially all of the tax benefits. This project, ladies and gentlemen, fits our investment criteria to a T. It has long-term offtake agreements for all of the energy produced with Google Energy LLC and with Dairyland Power Cooperative, a well-established electric co-op based in Wisconsin that serves utilities in multiple states. We also expect the project to be eligible for 100% bonus depreciation. This will be our sixth wind project in the infrastructure segment of our business. As you may recall, we've allocated $1.8 billion of our current five-year plan to grow our infrastructure segment. With the Tatanka Ridge project, we've already committed over $1 billion of that amount, and we're only seven months into the five-year plan. We have one other quick update for you on our infrastructure segment. You may recall that we will be the 90% owner of the Thunderhead Wind Farm being built by Invenergy in Antelope County, Nebraska. This 300-megawatt project was expected to begin service by the end of this year. However, we now project a several-month delay because the local utility has paused construction of a substation that's needed to connect the Thunderhead project to the transmission network. We continue to work with all the relevant parties to minimize the delay. I would point out, however, that we have a number of positive offsets in our plan. So this delay should not change the trajectory of our earnings growth for 2021. Switching gears now I'd like to touch on our commitment to environmental stewardship and the tremendous progress we're making. In 2019, we exceeded by a decade the goal we had set for the year 2030 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40%. The major solar investments we're building for our Wisconsin retail customers more carbon free energy is on the way. In light of our progress, we recently announced two new aggressive goals, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70% below 2005 levels by the year 2030 and for our generation fleet to be net carbon neutral by the year 2050. We look forward to working with all of our stakeholders to develop policies that will help us achieve these appropriate goals. We're also committed to reducing methane emissions. At the end of 2019, we were halfway toward our 2030 goal of lowering methane emissions from our natural gas distribution lines by 30% per mile and that's from a 2011 baseline. And now for a moment, I'd like to take a step back and look at the economic conditions in Wisconsin. As you would expect unemployment spiked during the first few months of the pandemic. The data for June were really encouraging. Labor market improved with the addition of more than 100,000 jobs and unemployment in Wisconsin fell to 8.5% well below the national average. We are also encouraged that the major economic development projects announced over the past few years are moving forward. For example, Amazon continues to expand here in Wisconsin with new local distribution centers. And HARIBO, the German candy manufacturer received local approval of its final site and operational plans in May. Groundbreaking is now projected to take place in September. You may recall this will be one of North America's largest confectionary plans. HARIBO expects to invest between $320 million and $350 million and hire 400 employees in the first phase of the project. Meanwhile, just a few miles south of Milwaukee in Racine county, Foxconn continues to develop its high-tech manufacturing and research campus. Recent published reports indicate that Foxconn could begin production at its new LCD fabrication plant as early as this fall. Construction is progressing well on Foxconn's smart manufacturing facility and its new network operations center. It's also important to note that we're seeing a strong ripple effect from Foxconn's commitment to Wisconsin. More than 70 additional investment projects have been announced within a 20-mile radius of the Foxconn campus. 70 plus projects range the gamut from health care to housing to industrial buildings to retail. We expect these developments will result in more than $1.2 billion of new private capital investment and more than 2,500 jobs. Long story short, our long-term growth projections remain fully intact. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our sales results for the quarter. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thanks, Gale. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the quarter, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 27,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 17 and 18 of the earnings packet. We saw an impact from the stay-at-home orders that were in place during much of the reporting period, but usage was better than we projected on the first quarter call. For example, residential sales of electricity were up 17.1% from the second quarter of 2019. And on a weather normal basis were up 7.3%, 3.4% better than our adjusted forecast. Small commercial industrial electric sales were down 8.6% from last year's second quarter. And on a weather normal basis, were down to 11.3%, falling 2.7% below our adjusted forecast. Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 12.9% for the second quarter of 2019, and on a weather normal basis were down 14.1%, 5.4% better than our adjusted forecast. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were down 2.7% from the second quarter of 2019. On a weather normal basis, sales were down 6.9%, tracking 1.7% ahead of our forecast. To summarize our experience during the quarter, we're encouraged that the monthly trends in sales improved sequentially each month. For more detail, see page 17 of the earnings package. At this time, I'd like to address our sales outlook for the balance of 2020. Our third quarter forecast has retail sales, excluding the iron ore mine, down 3.6% compared to 2019. Keep in mind, this is on a weather normal basis. In looking at the data for July, excluding the impact of weather, we tracked slightly better than our forecast. Looking now at the projections for the fourth quarter. Our adjusted forecast reflects continued economic recovery. We are looking at sensitivities to this forecast and watching economic indicators. We are prepared if the level of recovery would drop back to what we saw in the second quarter. We estimate that the additional impact to the pretax margin would be approximately $10 million to $15 million. We believe we could absorb this margin compression through efficiency measures already in place. And now I'll turn it to Kevin for an update on utility operations. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Scott. First, I'll note, we've remained focused on safety and efficiency throughout this health crisis. We have reduced our operations and maintenance costs in a reasonable manner with the help of technology we've invested in. Our employees continue to work remotely where possible, communicate with customers and follow health precautions. And through the first half of 2020, we saw our highest customer satisfaction results on record across all jurisdictions. Now I'll briefly review where we stand in our state jurisdictions. As you may recall, we have, no active rate cases at this time which is positive in our current environment. We are pleased that the Michigan Commission approved a proposal that allows us to defer $5 million in cost through 2021 rather than proceed with a rate case at our Michigan gas utility. In line with pandemic, we have worked constructively with our commissions to develop mechanisms for future recovery of foregone late payment charges, bad debt and other expenses. In Wisconsin, Public Service Commission has authorized us to defer foregone late payment charges, uncollectible expense and incremental pandemic-related cost. This covers all COVID-related expenses in our residential as well as our commercial and industrial sectors. The Illinois Commerce Commission has established a special use rider for the recovery of incremental cost and foregone late payment fees. Recall, there already is a bad debt rider in place. Turning now to our projects. We're continuing to add utility scale solar generation to our portfolio. You may recall that we're making good progress on the two solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, which will provide us with 200 megawatts of capacity. And as of to date, construction is more than halfway complete on our Two Creeks Solar farm. And we announced last quarter that we received approval to invest in a third solar facility Badger Hollow II to serve our We Energies customers. We expect it to go into service by December 2022. This is a slight timing change that should have no meaningful impact on our earnings or capital program. We believe this scheduled change will be beneficial to customers as we focus on managing project costs. As you may recall, we are evaluating site plans for two liquefied natural gas facilities to help serve our We Energies customers during the winter peak. We expect to invest approximately $370 million in these projects. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2021. In Illinois, we're making progress on the system modernization program. We have installed over 1,000 miles of new gas distribution pipe, and our work is almost 30% complete. Earlier this year, an independent engineering study confirmed the critical need for this project. The Kiefner engineering study found that over 80% of the pipes in the people\u2019s gas delivery system had an average remaining life of less than 15 years. Our improvements are making the delivery system safer and more allowable for our Chicago customers. Now with details on our second quarter results and more information on our outlook for the remainder of 2020, here is our CFO, Xia Liu. Xia? Xia Liu : Thank you, Kevin. I'm happy to join the group for this call, and I look forward to working with all of you and hopefully seeing you in person at some point. As mentioned earlier, our 2020 second quarter earnings grew to $0.76 per share compared to $0.74 per share in 2019. Despite the negative margin impact in this year's second quarter related to the pandemic, we were still able to achieve quarter-over-quarter earnings per share growth. This was due to our continued focus on operating efficiencies, executing on our capital plan, significantly warmer than normal weather and an increase in the authorized ROE for American Transmission Company. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter results on page 2021. I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share for the second quarter. Starting with our utility operations, we benefited by $0.07 per share from warmer weather and our continued focus on operating efficiency drove a $0.04 decrease in day-to-day operating expenses. These favorable factors were primarily offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense due to our capital investment and by $0.06 of lower margin, mainly due to reduced sales volumes. Scott has mapped those details out for you already. Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. We picked up $0.03 per share related to a FERC order that allowed ATC to increase ROE from 10.38% to 10.52%. This adjustment was retroactive to November 2013. Our energy infrastructure operations also were accretive to the quarter. The Coyote Ridge wind farm, which was placed in service in late December 2019 added $0.01 per share, primarily from production tax credit. The remaining $0.02 decrease is driven by some tax and other items, partially offset by Rabi Trust performance. Remember, variance in the Rabi Trust performance is mostly offset in the utility O&M. In summary, we outperformed second quarter 2019 by $0.02. Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. This year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Excluding the benefits of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on page six of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $88 million. This increase was driven by higher cash earnings and timing of tax payments. Total capital expenditures were $1 billion for the first half of 2020, a $182 million increase from 2019. This reflects our investment focus in the regulated utilities. We paid $399 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2020, an increase of $27 million over the same period in 2019 which reflects the increase in the dividend level that was effective in the first quarter of this year. In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2020. For the quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.74 to $0.76 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.74 per share in the third quarter last year. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the full year in the range of $3.71 to $3.75 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. We're delighted you've joined us. Again, as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect to hit the top end of our guidance range of $3.71 to $3.75 a share, assuming normal weather. We're also reaffirming our long-term projection. Our projection of long-term earnings growth in a range of 5% to 7% a year. Finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. Recall that in January, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6325 a share, that was an increase of 7.2% over the previous quarterly rate. We continue to target the payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Overall, we're on track, focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you very much. Now we will take your question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Rock and rolling, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Gale Klappa : How are you doing Shar? Shar Pourreza : Not too bad. Never a dull moment in utility land. But pretty good. So Gale, just a couple of questions here. Focusing on the infrastructure segment first, was the Tatanka Ridge acquisition, was that catalyzed at all by the current kind of market conditions? Or was this just a straightforward acquisition kind of along the lines of Blooming Grove and Coyote, et cetera? Gale Klappa : No, it wasn't catalyzed it all by the pandemic. This one is - we've been looking at this one for a number of months before the pandemic. So it was really just an ongoing part of our due diligence. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then sort of with this acquisition, and you highlighted this in your kind of prepared remarks that you're slightly over half of your allocation in the current plan for the infrastructure bucket. Should we sort of expect a slower pace in the coming years or perhaps an increase in the allocation as you kind of roll forward later this year, i.e., is there a point in time when we can see the infrastructure capital budget actually increase from the 1.8? Gale Klappa : Well, we'll see how things shake out when we update our five-year capital plan in the fall. But again, a couple of parameters that really govern our work in that infrastructure segment. First is our tax appetite. And it so happens that we continue to see very high-quality projects where we can efficiently use our tax appetite to generate cash and earnings and continue our progress in investing in renewables. So what we're looking at here in this five-year capital plan and in the next five-year capital plan is really that happy marriage of efficiently utilizing our tax appetite and investing in renewables that have very, very high-quality off-takers in our solid projects. Again, we would not expect over time the entire infrastructure segment really to grow to more than 10% of our total enterprise. That's basically our cap. We have plenty of room, even investing $1.8 billion in this five-year plan. At the end of that five-year plan, we're still only at 6% of our total enterprise. So plenty of room, and I think a number of very high-quality projects still in the pipeline. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. And then lastly, Gale, you guys obviously have a really ambitious decarbonization target to hit neutrality. Can you just sort of talk about next steps here? And then obviously, you're dipping your toes a little bit in solar, like one of your peers. Sort of this decarbonization target, does it sort of increase the importance of Peach Bottom. And then just maybe if we can conclude around, is there any sort of updates with your participation in Governor Evers decarbonation task force. So how do we kind of roll this up and build an investment case around it? Gale Klappa : Just for clarity, we don't get anywhere near Peach Bottom. I know you're thinking about Point Beach. Shar Pourreza : That's right. That's right. Sorry about that. Yes, correct. Gale Klappa : And I think Kevin is probably better looking than the CEO over there at [indiscernible] At any rate we are - to directly answer your question and for those who need the context, a significant percentage of the electricity we provide to our We Energies customers, like a quarter of it is coming from our Point Beach nuclear plant that we sold to NextEra many, many moons ago. Those units are set to turn age 60 in 2030 and 2033. And we're looking at all kind of alternatives. I can tell you now that there will be a very significant opportunity for us in terms of investment need in the latter half of the decade. Right now, if I were a betting man, I would look at substantially more investment in renewables and probably battery storage. But we will have more detail for you certainly on the next five years in terms of our generation reshaping, when we update our capital plan in November. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And is there any updates on the task force with Governor Evers? Gale Klappa : That work continues. I think with the pandemic, the time frame for recommendations was delayed, but I still believe there will be recommendations from Governor's task force by the end of this year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Xia, congrats on the transition. I know between Gale, Kevin and Scott, you're working with the best in the business. So that's terrific, congrats. Thank you, guys. Gale Klappa : Thanks, Shar. Xia Liu : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hey, Durgesh. How are you doing today? Durgesh Chopra : Hey, Gale good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Xia. I look forward to working with you. I just have one question. Rest everything is clear. On this - on the slide where you or in the press release where you break out the margin by segment, Wisconsin, in particular. I'm just wondering what this other margin number is. It's a big number in the Wisconsin reconciliation. It's like a 26.4 earnings or margin drag year-over-year. Any color on that? What is that comprised of? Xia Liu : Yes. I'd be happy to talk about that. I think the majority of that is COVID related. Remember Scott mentioned the reduction in the weather-normalized sales. So the majority of the 26.4 is COVID driven. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And that pretty much was offset by, if I'm reading this correctly, good weather in the quarter. Xia Liu : Yes, that's exactly right. The weather more than offset the COVID reduction for the quarter. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. So then just a quick follow-up. When thinking about O&M obviously, you've made a ton of progress in the quarter. How should we think about that effort going into second half of the year? Are you going to - do you flex that sort of up or down depending on how weather tracks out? Or you think that this quarter was more in line with how you have progressed in the past with just continued O&M savings? Gale Klappa : Durgesh, a very good question. Let me just say this. We have a plan in place that would allow us, as Scott mentioned during his remarks, that would allow us to overcome a substantial additional decline in energy usage, if we were to go back to the kind of conditions we saw in the second quarter. So we've got a plan in place that we think will be absolutely appropriate to continuing to deliver value and reach the top end of our guidance range. Now if things get better, if we see a stronger economic recovery, then obviously, we can flex in one direction or another. But we've been very pleased with the results so far. And I would also say that, for example, in Illinois, some of that's timing. Illinois will not be as hard hit as some of the other companies potentially because there's decoupling of our gas distribution sales in Illinois. So long story short, we've got really strong flexibility, we've got a great plan in place. It's delivering exactly what we expected to be. We can flex up or down as needed given the conditions. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you, very much Gale and thanks for answering my questions. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome, Durgesh. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time and congrats again Xia for the move. Perhaps if I can pick it up where Shar left off. On the investment and infrastructure side, I mean, I think you said yourself, you're half a year in, and you invested $1 billion out of $1.8 billion. Just given the timing of this capital, as you think about it and you have a sort of finite tax capacity. How do you think about it in those terms? If you can think about the - to the sense which you raise that later, is that necessarily going to be in the back half of the plan, just given how much tax appetite you've absorbed over a year. How do you think about it from that perspective? Just to quantify that, if you don't mind. And also, Gale, if I can clarify, I think you said this 6% of the enterprise. Is that 6% of earnings as well, just to make sure we heard you right as well on the through the plan. Gale Klappa : Well to answer, Julien, your last question first, yes, I would look at that as about 6% of total enterprise earnings. Again, that would be an investment of $1.8 billion with our prior investments as well in the infrastructure segment at the end of the five-year plan, delivering about 6% of the total enterprise's earnings. So the short answer to that is yes. Then in terms of how to look at all of this, by the way, while I'm answering that, you may want to think about Shar's comment about best-in-class. Still there, Julien? Unidentified Analyst : Absolutely. I was just waiting for you to keep going. Gale Klappa : I wanted you to ponder a little bit while I was answering your first question. At any rate, here's how I would look at it. We have found very high-quality projects early on in the five-year plan. So again, we're marrying high-quality projects with our tax appetite. So I would look at what we've accomplished so far is more front-end loading and more derisking of that segment of our investment plan. But again, we're going to be governed by two things : tax appetite, efficient use of that tax appetite and high-quality projects. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Fair enough. Second question, you guys have a carbon target. You guys are frankly expanding on those. How do you think about that reconciling with your day-to-day operational planning? And maybe this might be a good opportunity to talk about Columbia, for instance. But I don't want to leave the witness too much on the response here. Just how do you think about the carbon targets that you guys laid out most recently against your IRP planning? Gale Klappa : Well, I think it's actually not all that complicated. Clearly, as we look at the next 10 years, a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions over the course of - from where we are up to a 70% reduction, it will require continued reshaping of our generation fleet. And that in plain language means that some of the less efficient coal-fired power plants that we have in our system or that we jointly own, like you mentioned, Columbia, for example, those things will have to be looked at in terms of potential retirements. And we will provide you more color on all of that as we update our next five-year capital plan come fall. Unidentified Analyst : Excellent. Well, I'll let you execute against the best-in-class plan here. Take care, everyone. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hello, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. Just want to start off with, I guess, your sales expectations as you look at the balance of the year here. And if you could expand a bit on how this has trended versus your original expectations. It looks like residential shaped up quite well. Just wondering if you expect that to kind of continue relative to your expectations there? And any feeling for industrial activity over the back half of the year as well? Gale Klappa : Sure. Great questions. Well, let me try to summarize it, and then we'll ask Scott to add some color to this as well. When we had our last analyst call going into the pandemic, we projected that we would see about an 8.6% decline in total retail sales during the second quarter with the stay-at-home orders in place. We actually came in weather normal at about 6.9% down. So we ran better in Q2, the difference between 8.6% down and 6.9% down. So we ran better there. If you look at July and weather normalization over a short period of time, you know how I feel about that. It's more precise than accurate. But we are assuming for in our plan for Q3. Starting in July, about a 3.6% weather-normal decline in total retail energy sales. If you weather normalize July, Scott, we were running about 1% better than that. Scott Lauber : And the preliminary data we're looking at in using our automatic meter reading system, it looks about 1% better. So very encouraging as we look at those sales. I think another encouraging fact is when we look at new services that are being installed in our We Energies territory, our gas new services are up 11% compared to the prior year, and the new services we're seeing on the electric side is up 7%. So we're seeing some good customer growth and good construction projects even during this pandemic time. Gale Klappa : And I think in terms of specific industries that you asked about, and this is something we look at on a regular basis. We serve large commercial and industrial customers in 17 different sectors of the economy, as you've heard me mention before. The ones that seem to be hanging in there with any kind of strength at all, it won't surprise you, paper, food processing, food packaging, electronic controls. And I will say this, in fact Xia and I were talking about this just earlier today, we have less exposure to the automotive industry than many companies. In fact, we have far less exposure to the automotive industry that we had going into the '08, '09 recession. So a very diversified economy, a number of the large commercial and industrial customers were deemed essential to begin with because of, again, food, paper, food packaging and processing, et cetera. So we have a diversified set of customers that we are supplying energy to. But the one thing that Scott mentioned that is - that stands out to me also in the quarter, is just the number of new services that he was mentioning and the number of new services compared to last year, particularly on the natural gas distribution side of the business, where we continue to see strong growth. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. Yes. That was very helpful. Thank you. And one more, if I could. Just when it comes to savings here that you've been able to achieve year-to-date. I don't know if you're able to kind of share with us what number that would be in kind of the context for, how much of that is kind of - could be ongoing in nature versus onetime in nature? And then as you think about harvesting savings over the back half of the year, weather does turn favorable over the rest of the summer, how do you think about throttling that back to, I guess, de-risk 2021 at this point? Gale Klappa : Well, great question. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a plan in place where we think we could absorb the hit from the economy going back to the depths of where it was in the second quarter. That's probably another $10 million to $15 million of additional O&M reduction, if needed. If it's not needed, we will certainly continue on with our - with all of the efforts that we have ongoing to continue to keep the system reliable. I will say this, the reductions we've made so far have really had no impact on reliability. We designed them that way. So we're in a great position to be able to flex up or down depending upon what we see with the economy. And I can tell you, in terms of - Kevin and I have talked about this at some length. I can tell you in terms of - we get asked this all the time, what amount of the cost - additional cost savings we've identified and implemented, what amount of that is permanent. And Kevin, I would say right now, we continue to see that percentage increase, but I would say where we are, at least half of those savings. Kevin Fletcher : I would agree with what Gale has said. We have a culture of looking for ways to continue to be more efficient to take cost out of our business with looking at reliability, reliability numbers are strong, and I would agree with that, with the efforts we have in place, at least I have. Gale Klappa : One of the reasons - thank you, Kevin. One of the reasons why we're so confident is that for us, operating efficiency is not a program. It's not something we turn on and off. The way of life here and it's embedded for years in how we do business. So I hope that responds to your question. Jeremy Tonet : That was very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Michael, how are you today? Michael Weinstein : All right. How are you doing? Gale Klappa : Good. You may be in an area where liability suffers, same to [ph] Wisconsin. Michael Weinstein : I am signing off tomorrow. In terms of what you just said about how - at least half the savings from COVID-19 are sustainable going forward. What does that mean in terms of the 5% to 7% growth rate? Does that push you towards the upper end of that going into next year and beyond? Gale Klappa : Well, as you know, Michael, the capital plan is really the big driver of the 5% to 7% growth rate. But I will say this, and I think this is very encouraging. The kind of cost efficiencies that we've been able to deliver really are going to help us to continue to drive our capital investment plan in a way that continues to keep pressure off rates. So I think that - to me, that's the key ingredient here. We've been very successful, as you know, in basically holding rates virtually flat for the last five years since the acquisition of Integrys. And that's been very helpful, obviously, from all kinds of directions. But long story short, I think what we're seeing here is icing on the cake in terms of continuing to be able to invest the kind of capital we need to invest, achieve the 5% to 7% growth rate, continue to improve and maintain the reliability of the system, continue to invest in renewables to accelerate future that's got very low carbon to no carbon and keep pressure off rates. Michael Weinstein : And what about, sorry, what about in terms of the onshore wind projects, as you go beyond 2020 and the tax appetite starts to wane, you still have some more projects to invest in. Would you consider tax equity at that point? Or is this more - where you'll simply invest at the correct case so that your tax appetite absorbs it? Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, our tax appetite does not wane after 2020. That's why we have $1.8 billion in the five-year plan. And just a preliminary look beyond the five-year plan, we don't see our tax appetite waning. So that's kind of piece one. Piece two, there are plenty of high-quality projects in the greater Midwest that we're looking at. And I don't really see the need to venture offshore or change our risk profile by investing in something that we are not very familiar with, with high-quality off-takers. So again, don't think that our tax appetite wanes very quickly. It just doesn't. And they're all kind of really cool, solid projects that are in our pipeline that we're looking at that don't require us to venture offshore. Michael Weinstein : Okay. So is the current plan still anticipating you being a taxpayer in 2020, even with continued investment? Gale Klappa : Well, yes. And we'll let Scott and Xia explain that. Long story short with the tax rules, it's almost impossible to completely eliminate any federal taxes. Scott, Xia? Xia Liu : Yes, that's exactly right. We are in modest - we project to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. I think the... Michael Weinstein : Right. One last question for me. You guys have a very strong equity currency. There's a lot of - certainly, today, there's been some news on the M&A front in terms of in the industry. But I'm just wondering what kinds of - what I mean, can you comment a little bit about maybe your potential appetite for M&A, considering that you have one of the strongest currencies in the industry? And what your view of right now is of the current prices for other utility companies? And what kind of criteria you might be looking for if you were to even consider it? Gale Klappa : Well, let me answer it this way. My wife says that I'm boringly predictive. So I would give you the same three criteria because they haven't changed. In fact, I was mumbling them in my sleep last night. I mean our approach is exactly what you would expect it to be, disciplined, not overpaying. We don't get involved as a genital rule in processes or auctions. And the three criteria that we would apply to any potential opportunity remains set in concrete. First, we would have to believe after significant due diligence that we can make the acquisition accretive to earnings in the first full year after closing. Second, we're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it. The industry is littered with stories where that didn't end well. And then the third thing, which is probably the gating criteria today. We want to make sure that the earnings growth rate of anything that we would acquire would be at least as strong with our own organic growth rate, read that 5% to 7% a year. So those criteria are hard and fast. In fact, the first thing that Xia and I talked about on day one was those criteria, and she had a giant smile on her face. Michael Weinstein : Scott, you also have dreams in night about M&A? Scott Lauber : Just curious. Michael Weinstein : Have a good night, guys. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hi, Sophie. How are you today? Sophie Karp : I am doing well. Congrats on the quarter. And thank you for the time. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Sophie Karp : So it is pretty clear and I think a lot of questions have been answered. I just have one question. I'm not sure if you guys given it any thought, but so hydrogen seem to be making some kind of a comeback right now where people begin to look at it again as a potential - for its potential energy storage qualities, I guess, with the renewable build-out. Is that something you looked at, maybe have a pilot planned in that regard and just factoring it anyway in your planning? I'm just curious. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Great question. A lot of buzz, as you know, about hydrogen these days. Let me say this, we think there may be some potential there and there are lots of different ways if there might be potential. There are pilot projects. Florida Power & Light just announced a pilot project that will be going into service they believe in 2023. There are a couple of pilot projects that I'm very familiar in Europe right now. One of the things that we're looking at here relates to the potential use of hydrogen as a mix in our gas distribution lines. So there are lots of ways that the hydrogen angle can be played, but I will tell you, it is very, very early days. And we will - we obviously will keep a very close eye on this, but lot of research going on. Europe is probably a bit ahead in terms of the pilot projects. We are a long, long way away, in my opinion, from anything being commercialized and readily available. A lot of potential and it could, I think, help all of our companies get to the 2050 carbon goals. But long story short, this is really very early days, and we'll see where it all goes. But I think there's some possibility that we will - not only that we might be able to, but we will be looking at both renewable natural gas and hydrogen as part of the potential for our gas distribution company going forward. Kevin, anything to add to that? Kevin Fletcher : Well, hydrogen, I'm sure you know, is very commonly used in petroleum refining and fertilizing. But the issue is the production and pipelining cost of it. So we'll continue to monitor that along the way, Gale, and as it makes sense, we'll look at it for our future. Sophie Karp : Good. Thank you so much. Gale Klappa : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hi, everybody. Gale Klappa : Getting one of those blue martinis, whoever \u2013 they were lately. Michael Lapides : The only thing that\u2019s blue is my heart thinking about that [indiscernible] in the first three games and potentially given up that last playoff slot day. If there is anything that I am doing and about it getting Jon Marray [ph] and the team back on track. Gale Klappa : Michael, you know, that you\u2019re head coach down there was on the backstamp [ph] last year. Michael Lapides : I am excited about our \u2013 I like our coach. I like our coach a lot. Got a question for you. Someone else asked the question about your cold fleet and maybe some of the smaller or the less economic units. Actually, I want to turn that question the other way around. Because when I think about how to make material changes to your carbon footprint, it's not the small plants, it's the large ones that move the needle. How should we think about your largest coal facilities, whether it's the older Oak Creek units or the newer ones or maybe some of the other, the Weston 4, which is not that old. How do you think about the path to win some of those would be potential retirement targets? Gale Klappa : Well. That's a good question. But let me say this. We've already retired 40% of our coal-fired generating fleet, over 1,800 megawatts just since 2014. Most of those retirements were the older, less efficient plants. In fact, that's just the way we I think it's appropriate to look at the world. You look at what's on the bubble economically. So we don't have many of the smaller older plants left. We just don't because we've retired 40% of the coal-fired fleet. So as we begin to look at what other units are on the bubble, the economics will drive us. And I will say to you that our newer power, the future units at Oak Creek are so efficient and emit less carbon per unit of output than almost any of their coal-fired power plant on the planet, literally. So that would be the last thing you would look at. But long story short, what will drive our look at generation reshaping, our continuing look at generation reshaping is what is the least economic what can be replaced at a lower cost to customers, both in terms of actual operating dollars, actual capital expenditures, but also making the best in terms of environmental improvement. But we're not really driven necessarily by particular size, we're driven by economics. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you. And then a total unrelated question. Can you talk about Wisconsin, the customer bill? And where you see kind of your average residential and your average industrial rates relative to kind of your regional peer group? And if there is dramatic differences either above or below, what could potentially change that in the coming years in either direction? Gale Klappa : So let me say first, just to put things in context, we have, as you know, virtually frozen rates for the last five years. During that period of time, many of our regional peers and Beth likes to point this out. Many of our regional peers have actually - have actually had double-digit rate increases. Many of them year after year in terms of the rate increases that they've been authorized. So our competitive position, Michael, is really in great shape today. And if you look at customer bills, which I think is the appropriate measure and one that you're asking about, we're actually in great shape. And then we have - I mean, we're actually in great shape compared to our regional peers. But in addition to that, I want to talk about the other things that we've done that I think are relatively innovative, to be able to be incredibly competitive for new industrial customers. One of the things that we talked to Foxconn, they are glowing about their projected price per kilowatt hour. Our real-time pricing rates are getting our customers, industrial customers who are growing at prices under $0.04 a kilowatt hour. And recently, with natural gas prices down and demand down, gosh, there are days when it's $0.02 a kilowatt hour. So we have put in place a number of innovative rates to make our state incredibly competitive for new industrial customers and growing industrial customers. And I think you see that paying off in a number of the economic development announcements. But overall, in terms of our retail rates, residential, commercial and industrial, we are in very good shape competitively today. Michael Lapides : Got it. And final question. I know next year because you're usually on every other year cycle, is there supposed to be a rate case here in Wisconsin is - given just kind of what's going on in the economy, do you fill yourselves as needing to come in? Or would there be any leeway, any discussion with the commission to where you could potentially push that out another year or two and hold off from a filing? Gale Klappa : Yes. Good question. At this point, we'll wait and see every option is on the table. But I can tell you that the normal rate filing cycle that you're referring to would have us file sometime next year for rates that will go into effect in 2022 and 2023 with our forward look test periods. But again, to your question directly, no decision yet, but every option is on the table. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Gale. Much appreciate it. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome, Michael. Take care. Operator : Your last question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Thanks for filling me in. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. How are you doing today? Paul Patterson : Can you hear me? Gale Klappa : Yes. Can you hear us? Paul Patterson : I just did. Okay, sorry. I wanted to follow-up on Foxconn really briefly. So my understanding is that there's - at least last I heard there was a contract negotiation going on with the WEDC. And I was wondering if you have any update on that in terms of them getting the tax cut. It sounded like they got the jobs, they met the job qualification, but there are other issues, as you know, with this contract. So I was just wondering if, a, there was an update on that. And then the second sort of related question is you mentioned a lot of the economic development that's occurring around the Foxconn facility. And I'm just wondering, there was a lot of infrastructure and stuff that the state put in. And I'm just wondering, things obviously, we've got a pandemic, we've got budgetary issues with the state. Just whatever, there are things that can change, and obviously, that could potentially impact Foxconn. If it ends up that there isn't necessarily as much Foxconn investment as originally thought of and what have you. What's the potential for the development that you're seeing around the facility sort of still being there, if you follow me? It would seem to me that a lot of this, and I'm just thinking out loud, would probably be there just given the investment and sort of the activity already there, sort of its own sort of inertia, if you follow what I'm saying? Or can you give us any flavor on that? Gale Klappa : Yes. Sure, Paul. Let's talk first about the additional private investment that I mentioned within a 20-mile radius of the Foxconn campus. Since 2017, when Foxconn first turned dirt down there. There have been more than 70 projects, other capital investment, other private entities making or announcing $1.2 billion of additional projects and capital investment. And today, even with the pandemic, about two thirds of those projects, two thirds of those 70-plus projects are either complete or underway. So that is going extraordinarily well. And again, for those of us who've been involved in economic development, Kevin and I have been at this for a long time. We've always seen and believed in the ripple effect, particularly when you have a major company making that kind of a commitment. And that ripple effect is alive and well, believe me. I mean think about that, $1.2 billion of additional capital investment, more than 70 projects. Again, two thirds of those are either underway or completed. In terms of the Foxconn project itself, they have never stopped construction during the pandemic. They revised their footprint, they've revised their plan, obviously, to adjust to market conditions. But their activity continues at pace down in what they call Wisconn Valley. And yes, my understanding is they are in discussions with the state about some changes to the original contract, the original incentive contract. But I think that's largely driven by, for example, that contract, which is public, talks about a Gen 10.5 fabrication plant, which they're not building. So there need to be clearly some technical changes in the contract. But the two parties, as I understand it, are in discussion, those discussions are private. But from everything I can tell, Foxconn's commitment to Wisconsin continues. In fact, they announced that they'll be, as you may recall, they'll be producing now ventilators for Medtronic, which never was expected obviously, because no one knew about a pandemic coming, but they're going to be starting very soon, producing ventilators on that site for Medtronic. So there's a variety of high-tech things that I don't think any of us expected that are going on there. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. Thanks for the update. And I guess with respect to the climate stuff, really, we should be thinking November is probably when you're going to be elaborating more on sort of what you're going to be - how you're going to be how you plan on reaching those goals and everything? Is that - that's what I've gathered so far. Is that pretty much what we should stay tuned for? Gale Klappa : Yes, exactly. We'll roll out the broad details on our next analyst call, which is usually late October, early November and we'll be happy to provide all the details that you need during our discussions at the - what I believe will be a virtual EEI conference. Paul Patterson : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome Paul. Take care. Gale Klappa : All right, folks. Well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact Beth Straka. She can be reached at (414) 221-4639. Thanks, everybody. Take care.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Live from the heartland good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2020. First, I\u2019d like to introduce the members of our management team, who are on the call with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2020 earnings of $0.84 a share. Our solid results were driven by a rebound and economic activity in the region, warmer summer temperatures and efficiency gains throughout our operations. Scott and Xia will provide you with more details on the quarter in just a few minutes and Kevin will cover our operational progress. But first I\u2019d like to discuss our new five year capital plan, our roadmap for the next five years of capital investment. So for the period 2021 through 2025, we expect to invest $16.1 billion. It\u2019s the largest five-year capital plan in our history, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 7.3% above our previous five-year plan. We\u2019re calling this roadmap, our ESG Progress Plan because we\u2019re investing the $16.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. As you would expect, our ESG Progress Plan includes a significant investment in renewables. We\u2019re allocating nearly $2 billion to regulated renewables that will serve our Wisconsin utility customers. In addition to the projects we have underway, we plan to bring 800 megawatts of solar, 100 megawatts of wind and 600 megawatts of battery storage into our fleet. The data show that battery storage has now become a cost-effective option for us. Our plan also calls for modernizing our gas generation fleet. To improve efficiency we expect to retire 400 megawatts of older natural gas fueled capacity. In addition, we plan to purchase 200 megawatts of capacity in the West Riverside Energy Center. That\u2019s a new combined-cycle natural gas plant recently completed by Alliant Energy here in Wisconsin. And finally on the natural gas generation front, we plan to build an additional 100 megawatts of capacity using reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them RICE units. As we\u2019ve already seen in the upper peninsula of Michigan, RICE generation is flexible, reliable, and scalable. Now all of these efforts should allow us to retire 1,400 megawatts of our coal generation by 2025. The benefits of our ESG progress plan are very clear. We\u2019ll cut CO2 emissions, maintain superior reliability, lower our operating costs and grow our investment in the future of energy. Now, as you may recall, we\u2019ve already set aggressive targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. We\u2019re also working to make our generation fleet net carbon neutral by 2050. With the plan ladies and gentlemen that we just described to you we\u2019re able to announce today a new near-term CO2 reduction target. We\u2019re aiming to lower emissions by 55% below 2005 levels in just the next five years by the end of 2025. In addition for the longer-term, this generation plan will deliver significant economic benefits for our customers. Compared to the status quo, we expect customer savings of approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years. There are a number of other important elements in our ESG Progress Plan, and we\u2019ll be happy to share all the details with you at the upcoming EEI conference, but in summary, our updated capital plan should grow our asset base by 7% annually over the five-year period with no need for additional equity. And the plan fully supports our projection of long-term earnings growth at a rate of 5% to 7% a year. Now let\u2019s turn for a moment to the economy and a quick look at conditions here in Wisconsin. As you know, we provide energy to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers. Many of them produce and deliver essential services. During the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen particular strength in paper, food processing, packaging, plastics manufacturing and electronic controls. And there has clearly been a strong rebound in the labor market over the past few months. The latest available data show Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rates down to 5.4% and of course that\u2019s well below the national average. I would add that new developments are creating even more opportunity, particularly in the Southeastern corridor of the state. For example, Komatsu recently broke ground on a state-of-the-art manufacturing and global mining campus serving as its Milwaukee area headquarters. Our company sold 43 acres of land to Komatsu for this development, which is taking place in what\u2019s known as Milwaukee\u2019s harbor district. Komatsu expects to invest approximately $285 million in the project. When complete it will include engineering and robotics labs, a large office complex, a customer center, a modern manufacturing facility and more with a potential to employ more than a thousand people. Construction of the campus is expected to be complete in 2022. And literally just a few days ago, Amazon opened 2.5 million square foot distribution center in Oak Creek, that\u2019s just South of Milwaukee. This four story center is equipped with the latest and robotics for packing and shipping. And at full strength, Amazon expects to employ 1,500 full-time workers at its facility. And, of course, I know all of you are interested in the Foxconn development in Racine County. As we speak construction work continues on a smart manufacturing facility and a network operation center that will support high performance computing. Ground breaking of the high-tech campus took place just a little more than two years ago. Since that time Foxconn\u2019s plans have clearly evolved. The company is now assessing a much more diverse product line than originally envisioned. Now because of these changes, the State of Wisconsin is asking to revise its tax incentive contract with Foxconn and the Head of the State\u2019s economic development agency has said the door is wide open to support Foxconn\u2019s business expansion in the state. So all things considered with a resilient economy and major developments in the pipeline, we remain optimistic about our long-term sales growth. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it over to Scott and he will chat about our sales for the third quarter of this year. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the third quarter, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 32,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volume are showing on a conservative basis on Page 17 and 18 in the earnings packet. As you recall, we adjusted our forecast at the start of this pandemic. The results in the third quarter were better than our adjusted forecast across all customer classes. For example, residential sales of electricity were up 7.1% from the third quarter of 2019 and on a weather-normal basis were up 4.2%. That\u2019s a 1.6% better than our forecast. Small commercial and industrial electric sales were down 2.5% from the last year\u2019s third quarter. And on a weather-normal basis were down 3.3%. This was six tenths of 1% better than our forecast. Meanwhile, large, commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 5.4% from the third quarter of 2019, on both on actual and weather-normal basis. This reflects a rebound in economic activity in Wisconsin and was 4.3% better than our forecast. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity were down by three tenths of 1% from the third quarter of 2019. And on a weather-normal basis, were down \u2013 1.5%, tracking bull ahead of our forecast. And looking at the sales trend on Page 17 of the package, we continue to see favorable progression towards normal demand in the third quarter. In fact, we\u2019re very pleased with the preliminary sales results we\u2019ve seen for October. Of course, we\u2019re watching economic indicators as always, and we\u2019re prepared to respond if the level of recovery drops back to what we saw earlier this year. I also have a few updates on the wind projects in our infrastructure segment. Construction on the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge projects is on schedule. Blooming Grove should be completed by the end of this year. For Tatanka Ridge, we expect commercial operation in the first quarter of 2021. And turning to another of our projects, construction on the Thunderhead Wind Energy Center in Nebraska is nearly complete. However, as we reported last quarter, there will be a delay in the in-service date. This delay has been caused by a permit issue related to a substation being built by Nebraska Public Power District. We are working with all parties to complete the work and bring Thunderhead to commercial operation in the latter half of 2021. I would point out that we have a number of upsides in the plan. So this delay should not change the trajectory of our earnings growth for 2021. And now I\u2019ll turn things over to Kevin, to give an update on utility operations. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Scott. I\u2019ll start with the fact that we have maintained our focus on safety and customer service. In fact, our customer satisfaction scores remain at an all-time record high. Meanwhile, we have streamlined our operations and maintenance cost through a number of efficiency measures, and I\u2019m confident that the momentum we\u2019ve seen this year will continue. Now, I\u2019ll review where we stand in our state jurisdictions. In Wisconsin, I\u2019m pleased to report that just yesterday, our Two Creeks Solar farm began commercial operation, providing 100 megawatts of renewable capacity for the customers of Wisconsin Public Service, ahead of schedule and on budget. This is our first utility-scale solar project with an investment of $130 million. And we continue to develop plans for two liquefied natural gas facilities. We\u2019re working with regulators and local officials and pending all necessary approvals, we expect construction to start in the fall of 2021. These facilities will provide customer savings and enhance reliability during Wisconsin\u2019s cold winters. In Illinois, we\u2019re seeking a rate review for one of our smaller subsidiaries, North Shore Gas, which serves approximately 160,000 customers in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Rights for North Shore Gas were last set more than five years ago before we acquired the company. Since then we have consistently invested capital to serve our customers, while reducing operating costs. We expect a constructive dialogue with the Illinois Commerce Commission, as we seek rates that will support system safety and reliability. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Xia. Xia Liu : Thank you, Kevin. As Gale noted earlier, our 2020 third quarter earnings grew to $0.84 per share, compared to $0.74 per share in 2019. To reiterate Scott\u2019s comment, COVID-19 had a much milder impact on electric sales. Overall, we estimate that the pandemic caused a $0.01 decrease in margin for the quarter. This decrease was more than offset by favorable third quarter results, largely driven by our continued focus on operating efficiency, rate adjustment at our Wisconsin utility and the execution of our capital plan. Our electric utilities also benefited from warmer than normal weather. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes the comparison of third quarter results on Page 21. I\u2019ll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. Starting with our utility operations, this quarter, we outperformed third quarter last year by $0.11. Our focus on operating efficiency drove a $0.04 decrease in day-to-day O&M expenses. We benefited by an estimated $0.03 per share from warmer weather. And all other factors had a positive variance of $0.07, primarily driven by rate adjustment, continued recovery from capital investment and fuel. These favorable factors were offset by $0.03 of higher depreciation and amortization expense. Our Energy Infrastructure segment also was accretive to the quarter. The Coyote Ridge wind farm, which was placed in service in late December 2019, added $0.01 per share, primarily from production tax credit. Finally, the $0.02 drag in corporate and other, was driven by some tax and other items, partially offset by lower interest expense and improved Rabbi Trust performance. Remember, Rabbi Trust performance is mostly offset in utility O&M. In summary, we improved on our third quarter 2019 performance by $0.10. Now I\u2019d like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2020 effective tax rates to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6, of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $109 million. This increase was driven by higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital requirements, including COVID-related impacts. Total capital expenditures were $1.6 billion for the first nine months of 2020, a $107 million increase from 2019. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility. Last month, we refinanced $950 million of our holding company debt, reducing the average coupon of these notes from 3.3% to 1.6%. We will recognize the $0.06 make-whole premium in the fourth quarter, which we have already factored into our 2020 annual guidance. In closing, I\u2019d like to provide our updated guidance. We\u2019re narrowing, and raising our earnings guidance for 2022 to a range of $3.74 to $3.76 per share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Our previous guidance was in the range of $3.71 to $3.75 per share. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. We\u2019re on track for a solid year. Again in light of our strong performance, our guidance range as Xia indicated now stands at $3.74 to $3.76 per share with a clear expectation of reaching the top end of the range. We\u2019re also reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7% a year. And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As usual, I expect our Board will assess our dividend plans for next year at our scheduled meeting in early December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We\u2019re right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And operator, we\u2019re now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Now we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hey Shar, how are you doing today? Shar Pourreza : Oh, not too bad, Gale. How are you? Gale Klappa : We\u2019re good. Are you still in your unidentified bunker in Jersey? Shar Pourreza : Yes. I\u2019m ready to break out to be honest with you, but yes, still there, still there. Hopefully everyone\u2019s healthy. Gale Klappa : We\u2019re good here. Thank you, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Excellent, excellent. So a couple of questions here. First, obviously another healthy CapEx increases were heading into EEI. The generation spend can be a little bit more lumpy versus traditional renewable. So how do we sort of think about the cadence of that spend through 2025? Is it ratable? Is the 7% rate-based growth linear? Just remind us, what drive sort of the delta between rate-based growth and earnings growth, especially since you aren\u2019t issuing equity, right. That was clear. Or you simply Gale implying that unless something is unforeseen earnings growth should be close to the top end marrying 7% rate-based stuff. So how do we start to think about that? Gale Klappa : Okay, terrific. Let me handle the second part of your question first, and then we\u2019ll let Scott and Xia talk about the generation portion of the capital spend and how it shakes out in our projections over the five-year period. But in terms of your basic question about how the 7% asset-based growth translate into earnings growth, particularly since we don\u2019t need to issue equity. And that I think is a differentiating factor for us. And obviously I mean to be accurate as you know, you have to take into account the fact that we will be issuing some debt to help finance the capital program. So in essence, when you look at 7% asset-based growth and you throw in some assumptions on financing costs for debt, and remember, we\u2019re basically trying to finance our growth at 50% debt, 50% equity roughly. In essence that takes the 7% down a bit. And I would say that conservatively this plan should put us in \u2013 certainly in the low 6%s, but certainly in the top half of that \u2013 well into the top half of that 5% to 7% growth projection. I hope that response to your question, Shar, Shar Pourreza : It does. It does, and I appreciate that. Gale Klappa : All right. And Scott and Xia on the generation spending over the five years. Scott Lauber : Yes, there\u2019ll be more color in the deck that we provide this Friday and for EEI. But as you look at the five-year plan, it\u2019s spread probably over \u2013 more over the first four years, it\u2019s probably 2023 and 2022 and 2023 being the larger years on capital spending. But once again, we\u2019re early, we have to go through the regulatory approval, but it will affect the timing of this. But the typical five-year plan that you\u2019ve seen that you\u2019ll see later, the first three, four years or two or three years a much more analyzed a little more detail to it where the four and five years that usually tail off a little bit to get our quite \u2013 that\u2019s quite that far in laying out all those projects. So 2023 and 2022 are by the bigger years. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thank you for that, Scott. Gale Klappa : Yes. And Shar just to add other piece of color to that, we were expecting in our plan, we\u2019re expecting some unit retirements in 2023 and 2024. And in order to prepare for those unit retirements, we\u2019d have to be spending capital on replacement capacity upfront. So I think Scott, you\u2019re right. You would expect to see the lion\u2019s share. I would think of our generation capital spend 2022, 2023, 2024, and perhaps a bit over into 2025. Shar Pourreza : Right, right. That\u2019s helpful. And then like Gale, just as you kind of look at the generation transition, look at what you\u2019re proposing today, it\u2019s like 1.8 gigawatts of fossil fuel assets that are retiring, focusing on solar, batteries, wind. I mean obviously this is going to afford some additional O&M and cost savings, maybe some of the \u2013 that we\u2019ve seen in the industry. How do we sort of think about the size of the O&M profile and the trajectory as we think about 2021 and sort of beyond there as we\u2019re looking to sort of model the rate inflation or even the O&M profile you guys have. Because it just seems like this is going to lead to additional bill headroom for additional capital opportunities. Gale Klappa : Yes, Shar. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that, because yes, as we retire some of these older less efficient units, there is significant O&M involved in maintaining those units. There\u2019s also avoided capital. There\u2019s a significant amount of avoided capital here that would have to be spent on the older efficient units if we kept the \u2013 or inefficient units if we kept them running. To give you an example and then we\u2019ve all talked a good bit about this, as you can imagine in terms of what we really think is real in terms of the continuing decline in operation and maintenance costs, while maintaining really superior customer service. But say for example, a four-unit coal-fired plant that is an older plant, we\u2019re seeing probably net $50 million of O&M savings on a retirement of a plant like that, for example. So clearly there are coal retirements, as I mentioned during the script involved here, but its multimillion dollars of O&M savings not to mention additional fuel cost savings. So yes, there\u2019s going to be headroom here and we don\u2019t see this plan driving rate increases at all above the inflation rate. And in the longer-term, as I mentioned, compared to the status quo, I would expect at least $1 billion of savings compared to the status quo over about a 20-year period. But in the near-term, there\u2019ll be some little uptick that we\u2019ll have to ask for to take care of the recovery of the capital, but there\u2019ll be huge O&M offsets and fuel costs saving offsets for customers, so very little bit pressure. And then in terms of just where we are at this stage of the game Kevin, we really think like, as we look at finish our budgets for 2021 that the O&M savings trajectory we\u2019re on will continue. Kevin Fletcher : That\u2019s exactly right, Gale. As I mentioned in my comment, that we\u2019ve seen so far, we have full expectations continue going forward. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just lastly, for me, Gale, on obviously, we saw Foxconn\u2019s move last week to challenge of UDC\u2019s determination on its tax credits and the scope change. How do you sort of see this process kind of playing out and how should we sort of as observers on the sidelines, kind of think about it? Is it just part of the process given the design has changed a little. Do you still envision incremental opportunities with the project? Like, how do we sort of put all this sort of stuff together sitting on the sidelines? Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question, Shar. And I would give you a three-part answer. The first is, you\u2019ve heard me say this before, forget about what you read in the headlines. Look at what\u2019s happening on the campus. Look at the construction activity going on the high-tech campus that they\u2019re now two years into developing. Foxconn has invested over a $0.5 billion already in this campus. As I mentioned, construction continues. They\u2019ve already become the largest single property taxpayer in the county in \u2013 Racine County. And I do think what will happen here because the contract with the state was so specific about building a Gen 10.5 fabrication plan for LCD panels. I do think they will have to be some changes to the contract, which there are ongoing discussions about. But, again, I would say to you, look at what\u2019s happening on the campus. And I would add that, because their plans have changed and their original plan did not have high capacity computing. We\u2019re still seeing significant projection of demand for electricity. So our demand projections have not changed dramatically at all, because as they\u2019ve changed and evolved their plans, they\u2019ve added things like high capacity computing. And then the last thing I would say to you is, one of the products that they\u2019re looking at developing and producing out of that campus, our server parts and server racks. And they\u2019re already deploying a combination of technologies that I just really got a briefing on yesterday from them, which was just really amazing. They\u2019re already deploying on a test basis there at that campus, artificial intelligence, 5G and robotics to be the most efficient producer of server and server racks in the world out of that campus. So they\u2019re still very active in terms of determining what they want to do there. I do think it will probably require some modifications to the wording of the contract, but again, I would say, keep your eye on what\u2019s happening on the campus and we\u2019ll be happy to keep you updated. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Thank you guys. Gale, congrats on your expansion as Chairman. Now you\u2019re stuck with us till 2024. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Shar. Happy to be stuck. Shar Pourreza : All right. See you, guys. Gale Klappa : Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open Gale Klappa : Greetings, Julien, and where are you today? Traveling in the U.S. voting several times, I assume. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Always, every time. And let me reemphasize Shar\u2019s comment. We\u2019re pleased to be able to continue to report what we\u2019re doing over the next few years, too, so looking forward to that. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So if I can pick it up where you left the dock as well. Let\u2019s talk about the timing on the energy infrastructure, just more broadly as well. I know you guys talked to the generation piece here, but you all were so successful in this first year and pulling forward that cap back as you identified opportunities, et cetera. What\u2019s the potential we do that again, especially as it seems like the energy infrastructure opportunities before you were probably larger that now than they were before. So I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of myself here, but curious how you respond that. Gale Klappa : Yes. Well, first of all, I think your observation is correct. When you look at the pipeline of high quality opportunities that we are seeing that pipeline, even though, we have been very successful in pulling forward, as you say, a significant amount of investment in the infrastructure segment. That pipeline of opportunity is definitely broader and greater and deeper today than it was before the pandemic. So we are \u2013 as you know, we\u2019re being very selective here, because we were in a very strong, competitive position with our tax appetite and with the fact that we can bring these to closure without having to issue equity, without having to go through a lot of hoops. So we\u2019re being very selective and we\u2019re focusing right now on three or four near-term projects. I wouldn\u2019t expect any announcement \u2013 new announcement before the end of the year, but I would just say, watch this space for 2021. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. And then if I can turn back to 2021 in the context of earnings and earnings latitude, not necessarily on the longer term 5% to 7%, but just as you think about the O&M that you were able to pull the latitudes your numbers, perhaps, I\u2019ll frame it that way. How do you think about the ability to accelerate, especially, in the 4Q here some of the costs from next year and add confidence to your numbers going into next year. I\u2019ll put it that way. Especially, given some of the refinancing opportunities you all have as well. Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question, Julien. Let me say this, we have a significant number of maintenance projects underway now in the fourth quarter. We had identified, as you may recall, in addition to our original plan, which had about a 2% to 3% reduction in O&M for this year. In addition to that, we had identified up to about $80 million of additional cost reductions if needed. The good news is with what you\u2019ve heard in terms of a number of the positive developments. We will not need that deeper cost reduction. And in addition to that, Xia and the finance team did a great job, as you mentioned on the refinancing. So that\u2019s another plus. So there\u2019s a lot of work going on right now, in terms of the kinds of outage maintenance projects and other O&M projects that I think will be helpful and derisking 2021. Xia, anything to add to that? Xia Liu : No, I think you covered it, Gale. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome guys. I\u2019ll pass it over. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Julien. Anything else on your mind. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: We are good. Excellent. That\u2019s the block. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open Kevin Fletcher : Greetings, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey, guys. Considering that you\u2019re going to be a taxpayer in 2020, a modest taxpayer in 2020. Should depending on the outcome of the election there\u2019s talk of possible higher tax rates going forward. If there were higher tax rates, would that increase your ability to grow the infrastructure business faster, deeper? Have it be a higher percentage of overall earnings than your original plan, just curious how that might affect. Gale Klappa : Good question. Let me try to frame the answer and we\u2019re going to ask Xia and Scott to add whatever they would like on that question. For starters, we are always modest as you know. So there\u2019ll be a modest taxpayer in 2020, but with the way the current tax rules work on production track \u2013 on investment tax credits and production tax credits, we\u2019re always going to be no matter what the effective tax rate is. We\u2019re always going to be in our projections, a modest taxpayer simply because under the rules you really can\u2019t take it to zero. So that\u2019s one point. And then if tax rates go up, there\u2019s actually a couple of benefits to us overall. John? Xia Liu : Yes, I think one to your point, Michael, that if tax rates went up and we would potentially have a higher tax appetite, so therefore we could potentially speed up the infrastructure investment. And on top of that, you all knew that there\u2019s interest tax shield at the holding company. So with a higher tax rate that would basically provide some benefits at the holding company, and obviously we would need to work with the regulators in each jurisdiction on the \u2013 probably finance[ph], but if we\u2019re able to recover the higher tax rates then we would have better cash flow and credit metrics. And we have pass through mechanisms in all of the jurisdictions. So I think overall, we are prepared in case of different tax situation Gale Klappa : And Michael just out of curiosity, how are you going to avoid higher taxes? I don\u2019t think that works for you. Does it? Michael Weinstein : Modesty is the best policy. Gale Klappa : I would reiterate that all the facts, regardless of the tax rates we are going to look at the infrastructure segment long-term not being more than 10% of our total earnings. I just want to reiterate that with you. Michael Weinstein : Hey, just one more question and I\u2019ll let you go. There\u2019s talk also of extending or giving new tax credits to batteries going forward. Is that an area that you think you might be able to invest in going forward? If they \u2013 I guess presumably it\u2019s an ITC rather than a PTC. Just curious about how that might affect your thought process. Kevin Fletcher : Yes, I would guess it would almost have to be an ITC as opposed to a PTC, but yes. And you probably heard me say that for the first time in this new five-year capital plan that we\u2019re rolling out today, for the first time we\u2019re adding battery storage for our regulated business. The economics are such now that with the amount of battery storage that we think we need it will fill a very economic function for us with or without additional tax credits. But long story in short, regardless who wins the presidency, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there was some modification to all of the tax credits associated with renewables. And you can see a big push for tax credits for batteries. We have not counted on that in our five-year capital plan, but just the economics and the niche need that we have for batteries, particularly at peak times, it\u2019s beginning to make an in for the first time, its making significant economic sense for our customers. Michael Weinstein : Do you think there\u2019d be a role for batteries with the wind projects and the infrastructure business though? Gale Klappa : Oh, potentially, yes, absolutely. Absolutely and we have room at the number of our wind farms and our infrastructure projects. We have room for battery storage. So yes, that potentially could be an enhancement down the road. No question. Michael Weinstein : Great, interesting. Alright, have a great day. Take care. Thanks. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Jeremy. How are you? How\u2019s everything Jeremy? Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. Very good, thanks for having me. Gale Klappa : It\u2019s nice to being here. Jeremy Tonet : I was just wondering if you might be able to update us a bit on the local and economic sales trends across your service territory that you said were kind of underpinning favorable October trends, as you mentioned there. And also curious on expectations for the winter heating season under ongoing kind of COVID-19 impacts here and how do you think the impacts differ on the electric versus the gas operations there? Gale Klappa : Yes, that\u2019s a great question in terms of how the impacts differ between the electric and natural gas distribution business. And we have actually had a lot of internal discussion about that. First of all, let me say this, just to give you a kind of a framing answer related to the electric side and the trends we\u2019re seeing. As I mentioned to you residential consumption of electricity has exceeded what we thought during the pandemic. Now some of that was weather driven. We had a warm summer compared to normal, but some of it also is just the fact that working from home and schooling from home in many cases is just driving more energy consumption from residential customers. So the residential demand for electricity during the last few months, whether or not has actually exceeded our expectations, that\u2019s been on the plus side. We\u2019ve done better than we thought we would in terms of industrial demand for electricity still down, but we\u2019ve done better than we thought we would. As I mentioned during the script we have a number of industrial customers that produce essential products and certainly paper, food packaging, food processing, electronic controls, plastics manufacturing, we\u2019ve all seen strength among our customers in those segments. Where we continue to see a drag and it won\u2019t surprise you is in small commercial and industrial, many restaurants are still at 25% capacity. Just to give you an example, hair salons are having to operated at much lower levels, some university campuses are not back in terms of full complement of students so that the dorms are not full. So on the commercial side, particularly for small business, there\u2019s still a struggle going on. So that would be kind of my answer. And Scott and Straka can add whatever they would like and Kevin as well. In terms of the difference between electric and gas, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see, but we had a relatively cold October. For October temperatures in Wisconsin for that matter in the upper Midwest and actually even weather normalized, natural gas demand was better than we thought it would be, exceeded our projections. The other thing I can tell you that is, I think significant and Scott can add to this, we\u2019re seeing very, very good customer growth on the natural gas distribution side of the business. Scott? Scott Lauber : That\u2019s correct, Gale. Especially when you look at Wisconsin and the growth we\u2019re talking about on the industrial side and the economic development you\u2019re talking, we\u2019re seeing good natural gas growth and electrical growth. Gas growth, it\u2019s nearly 5% more new customer hookups this year than we had over last year. So good customer growth and had numbers like 3% or 4% on the electric side. So really positive as we\u2019re seeing new connections come on and you\u2019re right going into the winter months, for October our preliminary view looks reasonable and very happy with what we\u2019re seeing. Gale Klappa : Does that respond to your question at all, Jeremy? Jeremy Tonet : Yes, that was very helpful. Thank you for that. And then just wanted to go back to the O&M side, I guess, and how has O&M savings trended versus expectations, what you see extending into 2021 here? And really just want to see are these savings meaningful enough to potentially defer your next Wisconsin rate case in any sense on commission appetite are there? Gale Klappa : Well, Jeremy, let me say first on the rate case front, way too early to have any meaningful discussions about our potential filing in 2021 in Wisconsin. And I would just say simply say this, every option is on the table right now. And I will have a whole lot better feel as we move into the first part of next year, but every options on the table right now. And then, in terms of the O&M reductions, essentially I\u2019m guessing that we end up Shaw about 3% to 4% O&M lower for this calendar year than last calendar year. I was shaking your head up and down. Yes. We had identified potentially more O&M savings than that. But as we\u2019ve had a number of positive developments, bottom line is we simply don\u2019t need to cut that deep. But Kevin, everything I\u2019m seeing, I know you\u2019re closer to it than I am on the operational side. But everything I\u2019m seeing is that our momentum on O&M reduction will continue into next year and a big chunk of the savings that we\u2019re seeing are sustainable. Kevin Fletcher : That\u2019s exactly right, Gale. If you look at things that we\u2019ve learned during the COVID pandemic that we\u2019re all dealing with is, we\u2019ve been more effective in our field operation and scheduling. We\u2019re also completing the \u2013 our customer service platform. That\u2019ll be for We Energies here, the first of January and that will have a consistent platform available for all of our companies. And that will also give us some sustainability in our cost savings as well. Gale Klappa : And then of course we have in the future plan, as you know, we\u2019ve got retirements of older less efficient generating units, which also will deliver O&M savings. So we\u2019re very bullish and optimistic on our ability to continue to drive efficiency and best practice across our seven operating companies. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re more than welcome. You take care. Jeremy Tonet : You too. Thanks Operator : Your next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hello, Sophie. How are you today? Sophie Karp : I\u2019m doing great. Thank you. Good afternoon. How are you? Gale Klappa : In the great state of Ohio, right, in Cleveland. You hanging in Cleveland? Sophie Karp : No, no. I\u2019m in Utah. Hunkering down. Gale Klappa : Utah, Oh, wow. Good for you. All right. Sophie Karp : Okay. So a question for the guys on batteries, you mentioned that batteries are becoming a cost effective solution for you. Could you maybe put it in relative terms, cost effective relative to what? And I\u2019m assuming they replace in peakers or some sort, maybe if you could give us a little bit more color on how you deploying those assets and what you\u2019re comparing them too? Gale Klappa : That\u2019d be happy to. And the answer is really very straightforward. It\u2019s cost effective compared to other peaking solutions, if you will, compared to other capacity that we would need to help meet peak demand. Or as someone said during one of our meetings the other day, battery solution basically is going to give us sunshine after sunset, which I thought was an interesting comparison. But yes, for \u2013 when you compare it to other peaking technology, other peaking capacity, a certain amount of battery storage has become cost effective for our customers. Sophie Karp : So that is before any potential tax incentives are attached to it? Gale Klappa : That would be before any additional tax incentives. That is correct. We\u2019re not counting on any additional tax incentives at all. Scott Lauber : But if they\u2019re available, we will definitely take advantage of them. Gale Klappa : Oh, absolutely. Yes. Scott is right. Sophie Karp : Got it. In the storage solutions, are you looking beyond battery storage? Are you looking at any other, I guess, stationary power \u2013 stationary solutions maybe other types of chemistries, other technologies that are not batteries, or is it primarily just lithium ion batteries at this point for you? Gale Klappa : At this point, it remains lithium ion batteries. Now that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re blind to something else. But the plan, because it\u2019s proven, and we understand the costs and the effectiveness of the technology, the plan right now calls for lithium-ion batteries. If two years from now, two years into our five-year plan, if something else emerges that we know is cost-effective and reliable, then we would certainly be open to it. But right now it\u2019s lithium-ion and let me add to that just a philosophical comment. A company like ours, I don\u2019t believe in our whole management team feel the same way. I mean, we\u2019re not in the business of being on the bleeding edge of technology. I mean, this to deliver customer value and shareholder value, this is all about cost effectiveness and reliability, and that\u2019s our job. Cost effectiveness, reliability, customer satisfaction, all of that leads to shareholder returns. So we\u2019re a very close follower. And Kevin is on the Board of the Electric Power Research Institute. I was years ago, we participate in a number of the experimental projects. We stay abreast of technology developments, but we\u2019re not \u2013 but for our customers and for what we believe is the core of how we do business. We\u2019re not into the bleeding edge of technology. Sophie Karp : Thank you. This is all for me. Appreciate the answers. Gale Klappa : Oh, you\u2019re more than welcome. Take care of Sophie. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hi, Michael. How\u2019s it going today? Michael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. I\u2019m doing well, Gale. I\u2019m happier sticking around hopefully we could get a couple of bucks titles during the next four years, right? Gale Klappa : We\u2019re certainly hope so. And I\u2019ve had to take a lower pay because we have to get more to be honest, I think, we\u2019ll see. We will talk about that. Michael Sullivan : All right, sounds good. Hey, I just had a question on the coal and gas that you\u2019re shutting down the 1,400 and 400 megawatts. Are you able to quantify that the rate base \u2013 the remaining rate base value of that and how that\u2019s planning to be recouped? Gale Klappa : Absolutely. So if you think about, and again, those retirements will occur probably most of them in 2023, 2024. So if you look at our projected rate base for 2025, it\u2019s roughly across our entire operation, our entire system. It would be roughly about $32 billion. If you look at essentially what we will be retiring, the remaining rate basis probably roughly saw $600 million that of deferred taxes. So a way to look at that is it\u2019s about 2% of our total asset base or will be about 2% of our total asset base and for Wisconsin under 5% of our rate base. So that\u2019s really kind of the basic numbers as we see them today. And in terms of future recovery, we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve done very well in terms of coming to an agreed upon solution with the commission, with the environmental advocates, with the industrial customer groups. We\u2019ve got a good track record of coming to an amiable and constructive solution in terms of recovery also potentially in terms of some securitization, particularly of environmental control costs. So, there\u2019ll be a lot of discussions over the next four years, but in direct answer to your question, less than 5% of the Wisconsin rate base by 2025 and roughly about 2% of our total asset base. Michael Sullivan : Great. That\u2019s super helpful. And then my second question was just, you mentioned in the remarks about filing a North Shore Gas case in Illinois, any near term plans to do the same for Peoples Gas? Gale Klappa : Short answer, no. Michael Sullivan : Simple enough. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Paul. Paul Patterson : Hey, greetings. So just to sort of I know it\u2019s a little far off, but when COVID is over, are you seeing any \u2013 what are your thoughts about what you think demand growth were, the sort of the economic activity that\u2019s occurring and that you\u2019re seeing, are you seeing any potential changes in usage patterns happening after COVID, more telecommuting changes in peak, anything like that, that you\u2019re potentially thinking are going to be more long lasting then once the pandemic is kind of over? Gale Klappa : Well, that\u2019s a good question, Paul. In everybody\u2019s crystal ball is a bit fuzzy after what we\u2019ve all been through in 2020. However, a couple of thoughts for what there were. I think we\u2019ve all seen how telecommuting, working from home, working remotely can lead to positive results. And I think, most all major corporations, ours included are going to need less office space. I think some amount of remote working will be a permanent part of the American landscape and the corporate landscape for many, many years to come. So the question then becomes, well, how much remote working will remain after COVID is finally conquered. And what does that mean in terms of commercial energy usage, and also in terms of continuing growth in residential energy usage? And those questions are still to be answered, but I think to me, manufacturing, particularly with this harden area as we have a manufacturing and distribution in the Southeastern corner of Wisconsin. Some of these projects may move a few months here or there, but as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a hot area for industrial and commercial growth right now, we don\u2019t see that diminishing. So then the question becomes the things shift around a bit between commercial and residential, depending upon how much work at home activity there continues to be post the vaccine. Kevin, any other thoughts? Kevin Fletcher : Gail, that\u2019s certainly true for the broader group if you look at our economy. If you just look again at what we\u2019ve seen as a result, you mentioned about facilities. Now, we\u2019re seeing that because of the positive results and meeting the needs of our customers, we don\u2019t need as much in the biofacilities that we\u2019ve had in our major markets. So as you pointed out, I think looking broadly other industries will be like us in that perspective, but I would also agree it\u2019s really too early to tell to see how we bounce back and how quickly we bounce. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. So on that note that, you guys have a large amount of industrial activity that you guys have gone over, and you\u2019ve got, also things have changed over the years. You\u2019ve got a large amount of geographical diversity and what have you. And you mentioned Foxconn and there\u2019s as you know in the immediate sort of saga about this, and I know you\u2019re very supportive of Foxconn. You see that a big win and what have you, but let\u2019s just, for argument\u2019s sake, say that for whatever reason Foxconn and the state can\u2019t come to an agreement. Given everything that you got going for you, with the dynamic growth in light around you, but also just your geographic diversity, the size of the company now; what kind of impact would that have? If it actually just didn\u2019t happen. Do you follow what I\u2019m saying? Gale Klappa : Yes. Well let me say, first of all, I mean Foxconn is a huge corporation. I think from a revenue standpoint, they\u2019re the fourth largest tech company in the world. But even a company that size, I mean, they\u2019ve already invested $0.5 billion, more than $500 million in beginning to build out the campus that we\u2019ve talked about in Racine County. So even a company that size, I don\u2019t think would just walk away from $0.5 billion investment that they just made in very modern state-of-the-art production equipment. So, and to take that a step further if they did nothing more, they would still have $0.5 billion of investment. They would still have significant electric demand because they\u2019ve added high capacity computing to their plans. In fact, that\u2019s already being built right now. And we\u2019ve already seen $1.3 billion of additional private investment that has nothing to do with Foxconn directly, but $1.3 billion of additional private investment, two-thirds of which is either complete or underway in the 10-mile around the Foxconn campus. So there\u2019s already been from a textbook economic development standpoint, Paul, there\u2019s already been tremendous ripple effect, and the state has benefited from that. To put that in perspective if there was no more investment from Foxconn at $500 billion \u2013 or $500 million, which they\u2019ve already done would still be the largest economic development project in the history of the State of Wisconsin. Then we have herbal, which we talked about a lot, the gummy bear people, they are breaking ground next month. And their investment is going to be, gosh, probably 30% to 35% more than they originally envisioned. It\u2019s going to be a much bigger campus. So we\u2019re seeing such tremendous opportunity and tremendous pipeline of growth that, I\u2019m not overly concerned about what might happen. And also, I mean, there\u2019s good faith on both sides here. So, I mean, I just don\u2019t see, despite all the political rhetoric that you see again, my advice is forget the headlines. Look at what\u2019s going on, on the ground. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. I guess we could take that further than maybe Wisconsin. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Gale Klappa : You are more than welcome, Paul. Gale Klappa : All right. I think that wraps us up folks. That concludes our conference call for today. Thanks again for participating. Always a joy to be with you. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact Beth Straka. She can be reached at (414) 221-4639. Thanks everybody. Stay safe and have a good election day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's conference call for Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time.  Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.  During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers.  In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for our calendar year 2020. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2020 earnings of $3.79 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes.  But first, I'm pleased to report that we delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance from customer service to network reliability to earnings per share, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our focus on efficiency, on financial discipline and an encouraging rebound in energy demand during the second half of the year resulted in the highest net income from operations and the highest earnings per share in company history. And throughout the difficulties of a pandemic year, we also accelerated our support for the communities we serve. In total, our companies and foundations donated more than $20 million to nonprofits across our service area, including more than $2 million to direct COVID-19 relief efforts. We also made significant progress on diversity and inclusion. We spent a record $303 million with diverse suppliers during the year, and through our Board refreshment, 46% of our Board members now are women or minorities. In addition, we set new aggressive goals as we continue to improve our environmental footprint.  In fact, I'm pleased to report that based on preliminary data for 2020, we reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50%, below 2005 levels, and we have, as you know, a well-defined plan to achieve a 55% reduction by the end of 2025. Over the longer term, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2030, and as we look out to the year 2050, the target for our generation fleet is net zero carbon.  Our new 5-year capital plan lays out a road map for achieving these goals. We call it our ESG progress plan. The largest 5-year plan in our history. It calls for investment in efficiency, sustainability and growth, and it drives average annual growth in our asset base of 7% with no need for additional equity. Highlights of the plan include 1,800 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage that would be added to our regulated asset base in Wisconsin.  And we've allocated an additional $1.8 billion to our infrastructure segment, where we see a robust pipeline of high-quality renewable projects, projects that have long-term contracts with strong creditworthy customers. All in all, our plan positions us to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer.  And now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. It was, of course, an unusual year for everyone, but many of our commercial and industrial customers prove to be quite resilient, providing essential products and services, such as food, plastics, paper, packaging and electronic controls. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 5.5%. That's more than a full percentage point better than the national average.  And as we look to the year ahead, we see positive signs of continued growth. For example, Green Bay packaging is building a major expansion of its mill in Northeastern Wisconsin. It's a $500 million addition and is expected to be completed later this year. The Foxconn, Komatsu mining, HARIBO and Milwaukee Tool projects that we've reported to you in the past are all moving forward as well. So we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth.  Finally, I know many of you are interested in our rate case calendar for the year ahead. As you know, under normal circumstances, our Wisconsin Utilities would be filing rate reviews later this spring for energy rates that would go into effect on January 1, 2022. Of course, we're in the middle of anything but normal times, and I can tell you that we've begun discussions with the commission staff, and we'll be talking with other major stakeholders to determine whether a 1-year delay in a filing would be in everyone's best interest. I expect the final decision on this around the end of the first quarter.  And now I'll be happy to turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results and our forecast for 2021 as well as an update on our infrastructure segment and our O&M performance. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2020, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 27,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown beginning on Page 17 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 2.1% compared to 2019, and on a weather normal basis, deliveries were down 2.9%.  Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin decreased 7.9% versus 2019 and by 2.4% on a weather normal basis. This excludes gas used for power generation. On the electric side, you'll note the positive trend that we have seen in residential sales has continued. Importantly, it has counterbalanced the weakness in small commercial and industrial sales caused by the pandemic. Meanwhile, large commercial industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 7.1% for the full year compared to 2019 on a weather normal basis. However, these sales were only down 4.6% for the fourth quarter, a notable positive trend, reflecting the recovery of Wisconsin's economy. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our 2021 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment. We are using 2019 as a base for 2021 retail projections. We're using 2019 because it represents a more typical year. We are forecasting a decrease of 1.5% in weather normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine compared to 2019. This would represent a 1.4% increase compared to 2020. We expect large commercial and industrial sales to continue to improve and anticipate the same positive offsetting relationship between residential sales and small commercial industrial sales.  For our natural gas business, we project weather normalized retail gas deliveries to decrease by 2.4% compared to 2019. This leads the projected sales outlook compared to 2020 relatively flat. With this in mind, we remain focused on operating efficiencies and financial discipline across our business. We lowered operations and maintenance costs by more than 3% in 2020, and we continue to adapt new technology and apply best practices. We plan to reduce our operations and maintenance expense by an additional 2% to 3% in 2021.  I also have an update on our infrastructure segment. The Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge projects are in service now and came in ahead of time and on budget. As a reminder, our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service by the end of the third quarter. We expect this segment to contribute an incremental $0.08 to earnings in 2021. And now I'll turn it over to Kevin for his update on utility operations. Joseph Fletcher : Thank you, Scott. Throughout 2020, we kept the energy flowing to our customers safely and reliably. Our largest utility, We Energies, was named the most reliable electric company in the Midwest for the tenth year running, and our Peoples Gas subsidiary was named the most trusted brand and a customer champion for the second year in a row by Escalent, a leading behavior and analytics firm. Now I'll review where we stand on current projects and our ESG progress plan. As you heard in our last call, the 2 Creek solar farm is now operating. As we've mentioned, this is a very large project.  In fact, just days after achieving commercial operation this past November, our share of this project accounted for more than 20% of the solar output in the entire MISO generation market. Also in Wisconsin, We Energies is making progress in the approval process for two liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters. If approved, we expect to be in construction in the fall of this year and to invest approximately $370 million in total to bring the facilities in operation in 2023. And as Gale just mentioned, our ESG progress plan includes 1,800 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage. Filings with the Wisconsin Commission for a number of these projects will begin in the first quarter.  Turning to Illinois. As you may recall, we are in the midst of a rate review for one of our smaller subsidiaries, North Shore Gas, which serves approximately 160,000 customers in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Rates for North Shore Gas were lapped set more than 5 years ago before we acquired the company. Since then, we have consistently invested capital to serve our customers while reducing operating costs. The Illinois Commerce Commission has set a schedule for concluding the case. Greetings are expected to begin in late April with the final order in September.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you very much. We're confident that we can deliver our 2021 earnings guidance in the range of $3.99 a share to $4.03 a share. This represents earnings growth of between 7% and 8% of our 2020 base of $3.73 a share. And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend to $0.6775 a share for the first quarter of 2021. It's an increased focus of 7.1%. And the new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.71 a share, and this marks the 18th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Right smack dab in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.  Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financials and our first quarter guidance. Xia? Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Our 2020 earnings of $3.79 per share increased $0.21 per share compared to 2019. Our favorable 2020 results were driven by a number of factors : These included the execution of our capital plan, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities, ROE improvement at American transmission company, production tax credit in our infrastructure business and continued emphasis on operating efficiency.  These factors helped us to overcome the sales impact of COVID-19 and mild winter weather, and all of our utilities met their financial goals in 2020. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of 2020 results on Page 21. I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share.  Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.22 compared to 2019. First, O&M expenses were favorable. This includes $0.08 from lower day-to-day O&M expenses and $0.09 from lower sharing amounts in 2020 at our Wisconsin Utilities. Second, despite the impact of COVID-19 and reduced wholesale and other margins, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities continued capital investment and fuel drove a net $0.21 increase in earnings. Third, we had $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and an estimated $0.05 decrease in margins related to mild winter weather year-over-year. These factors partially offset the favorable items we discussed. Overall, we added $0.22 year-over-year from utility operations. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company increased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. Recall that $0.07 of $0.08 were driven -- was due to ROE changes from FERC orders issued in November 2019 and May 2020, $0.04 resulted from the November 2019 order and $0.03 from the May 2020 order and $0.01 came mainly from continued capital investment.  Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.05 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily from production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. These include the Coyote Ridge Wind Farm placed in service at the end of 2019. Additional 10% ownership of the upstream wind energy center and the Blooming Grove Wind Farm came online in early December. Finally, you'll observe that we recorded a $0.09 charge in Corporate and Other to account for the make-whole premiums we incurred in the fourth quarter as we refinance certain holding company debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. The remaining $0.05 decrease is related to some tax and other items, partially offset by lower interest expense. In summary, WEC improved on our 2019 performance by $0.21 per share.  Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. Our effective income tax rate was 15.9% for 2020. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, our rate was 20.2%.  Looking to 2021, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.  As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan.  Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $149.5 million. Our increase in cash earnings in 2020 more than offset by higher working capital requirements, primarily related to COVID-19 and by higher pension contributions.  Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.9 billion in 2020, a $345 million increase from 2019. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and contracted renewable businesses at our Energy Infrastructure segment.  In terms of financing activities, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we opportunistically refinanced over $1 billion of holding company debt, reducing the average interest rate of these notes from 3.3% to 1.5%.  We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. As expected, our FFO to debt ratio was 15.4% in 2020. Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contributions and customer arrays related to COVID-19, our FFO to debt was 16.9% in 2020. At the end of 2020, our ratio of holding company debt to total debt was 28%, and below our 30% target. In addition, as Gale mentioned, we have no need for additional equity over the 5-year forecast period.  Finally, let's look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2021. Last year, we earned $1.43 per share in the first quarter. We project first quarter 2021 earnings to be in the range of $1.45 per share to $1.47 per share. We have taken into account mild weather to date, and this forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. For full year 2021, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $3.99 to $4.03 per share. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you so much. We're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready to open it up for a little trash talking and the Q&A portion of our conference call today. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. James Kennedy : Sorry to disappoint, it's actually James for Shahriar. Gale Klappa : That's all right, better looking and younger. James Kennedy : Yes, exactly. The easier question. So I guess, if we could start on the infrastructure side, you've laid out $2.2 billion going forward. How should we sort of think about the cadence of that? And does the extension of tax credits earlier this month kind of change any of your timing or thoughts there? Any changes in the opportunity set? Gale Klappa : Happy to answer those questions. First of all, for the 5-year plan, we've laid out $1.8 billion of additional capital in that 5-year plan. As I mentioned in our -- in the prepared remarks that we're going through due diligence on a number of projects right now. We've got a robust pipeline that we're looking at. And because we're so far ahead of schedule on our infrastructure segment right now, we can afford to be very selective and really cherry-pick only the very best projects that meet or exceed our criteria.  So long story short, the cadence will continue. It wouldn't surprise me if we have 1 or 2 more announcements during the calendar year 2021. And then regarding the change in the tax credits, the extension of the tax credits. Really, all that does, I think, is give us even more to look at in the pipeline. It certainly does not in any way diminish our opportunity set.  And remember that we're really utilizing our tax appetite here as a way to continue to grow earnings, continue to improve our environmental footprint and build optionality for down the road when we're certainly going to need in our retail rate base, a more carbon free energy. Joseph Fletcher : Just so there is no confusion, it is $2.2 billion in the 5-year plan, $400 million of that is the Thunderhead project that has been announced already. The additional $1.8 million is just what hasn't been announced yet. Just so there is no confusion. Gale Klappa : Yes. We have $1.8 billion to look at. Thunderhead is on its way, we hope, by the end of the third quarter. James Kennedy : Perfect. And I guess just kind of following on the clean resources side. Since you and Shahriar last spoke, we've seen NextEra formally file at the NRC to extend the life of Point Beach. Have you had any conversations with them yet? Are there any general updates there to think about potential recontracting or retirement? Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, they're in the very early stages of thinking through what they might want to put together for a life extension at Point Beach. And we have had some very preliminary discussions. But one thing that's very clear from our standpoint and NextEra standpoint, we are going to make the best decision possible from the standpoint of economics for our customers whether that includes an extension of Point Beach, whether that includes an investment opportunity, but either way, I see us having a robust investment opportunity set as we get into the next decade, one way or another. James Kennedy : Got it. Congrats on the strong finish this tough year. Operator : Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Durgesh Chopra : I'm clear on the quarter. Thanks for the update on '21. Just on the rate case front, Gale, just -- have you been here before? So have you done this in Wisconsin before, can you just remind us? And what might the options look like? Could you defer the rate increase? Or if I'm thinking about 2022, could you accelerate your cost savings to sort of stay on target with your 5% to 7% EPS growth rate? Just any color around that would be helpful. Gale Klappa : Sure. Thank you, Durgesh. I appreciate the question. I mean, the short answer is, yes. We have had stay outs before. In fact, if you think about what occurred after the acquisition of Integrys in 2015, we were out of a rate case for 4 years. Again, in constructive discussions with the commission staff and the intervenor groups.  So again, as I mentioned to you, we're in early stages of discussion right now with the commission staff. We will be talking with all the stakeholder groups. The concept would be rather than potentially filing a rate case on a normal schedule this year, the concept would be, is it in everyone's best interest to have a 1-year delay in the filings for our Wisconsin utilities.  And so we're working on what the outline of that looks like and whether or not, again, everyone would agree that it's in the best interest of all parties involved for us to push out, given where we're at with the economy, et cetera, for us to push out a rate filing for one year. And I do believe those conversations are constructive, and we should have a final decision. I would think around the end of the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So listen, incredible cost reductions, right? And so here's what I want to know. How are you guys continuing to reduce costs as you think about this 2% to 3% after a year where so many of your peers already brought down cost, and the question is the sustainability of those cost reductions. So if you could elaborate on that?  And then separately, just to follow-up on the last one, I'll throw it in there. You've already articulated some benefits on O&M. You've talked about your refinancing activities here that certainly have some tailwinds. What other pieces in this -- what other ingredients are there in terms of a stay out here that are relevant in these conversations, if you may? Gale Klappa : Okay. Great questions, as always, Julien. Well, first of all, related to the sustainability of O&M reductions, let me be very clear. We have continued runway, and I believe strong sustainability for continued O&M reductions. And let me give you 3 reasons why. I mean, the first is, we're pretty damn good at it, number one. Number two, we continue to benefit from putting in common systems across our footprint. Remember, we had the acquisition of Integrys at the end of 2015. Since then, we have done an enormous amount of work to basically put everybody on the same platforms. We put in a new general ledger for every one of the companies. Just -- Kevin, just 10 days ago, 12 days ago. We completed a major conversion to a brand-new customer information and billing system where all 7 of our customer-facing utilities are now on that system. That is going to drive the optimization of our call centers, significant cost reduction. So number one, we are very, very good at financial discipline. Our operating folks are just terrific. Every single area of the company as a cost initiative for 2021 and beyond. And really, it's more than a cost initiative, it's an efficiency initiative.  So I feel very good about basically our DNA in terms of continuing to drive efficiency and best practice across the enterprise, number one. Number two, just the continued ability to optimize the organization. We still have a runway to go there, post the acquisition of Integrys. And the example I gave you of a common customer information and billing system, I think, is a very good example of that. And then thirdly, we've announced, as you know, the retirement of a number of older, less efficient coal-fired power plants. There are significant O&M savings that will derive with the retirement of those plants, particularly over 2023, 2024 and 2025. The retirements are really going to come in that time frame, but there are millions of dollars of cost savings as we retire those plants going forward and replace that capacity with much more efficient technology. So that's a long answer to your question, but I hope it gives you some color on -- first of all, our success at continuing to drive efficiency, but also our -- the reason why we feel that that's sustainable and ongoing. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And then in terms of the rate case itself, I mean, it sounds like you've got the key ingredients to justify not going in for a rate increase, I suppose. Gale Klappa : Well, Julien, if we didn't, we'd be talking a whole different story here. Now we feel good about depending upon everyone's view of whether or not it's in the best interest of the state to us for us to stay out for another year. We feel very good about our ability to do that, again for both our customers and our shareholders. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Excellent. And that comment on '23 to '25, that relates to Columbia here, just to tick and tie thing? Gale Klappa : Oh, gosh, it relates to the four older units at our Oak Creek site. It relates to Columbia. That was our player to be named later in our investor deck. So that's -- because our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary is a minority or at Columbia, and it relates to a unit as well at Wisconsin Public Service. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So it's across the fleet. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to kind of start off with a high-level question, if I could. The Biden administration has some new emission reductions goals out there, and I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on them. And if this becomes law, how this might impact WEC? Gale Klappa : Are you thinking, Jeremy, specifically about the aspirational goal of a carbon-free grid by 2035? Is that your thought process? Jeremy Tonet : Yes. Gale Klappa : Okay. All right. Well, first of all, I think if you asked anyone in our industry, you never say never, but that is one tall -- I would kind of elegizes it to a moonshot actually. When you think about what it would take, and again, the pace of technology development can change all of this.  If you think about what it would practically take to get to a full carbon-free grid by 2035, you would frankly have to have the enormous technological change. If you think about what levers could you pull to get there, and they're probably four. One might be huge advancement in modular nuclear. One might be continuing advancement in the cost effectiveness of carbon capture. One might be a breakthrough in long duration battery storage. The other would be hydrogen.  Again, when you look at where hydrogen is at in terms of bid stage of development, hard to think that, that could be widely available as a tool in 2035. Modular nuclear is a long way away being widely available. So that kind of leaves you with carbon capture. It also leaves you with, can there be some more significant advancement in battery technology for longer duration storage. I think those are the elements that we would continue to look at. If I were a betting man, I would say carbon capture is probably further along. But long story short, it's a tall order. And in the meantime, I think the good news is, our industry has done so much already. Our company has done so much already in emission reduction.  Our goals are mirror the goals in the Paris Climate Accord. So regardless of whether we're totally there in 2035, I think we can continue on the path of reducing emissions. We don't need any change in technology to hit our 2030 goal of a 70% reduction. So I'm still optimistic about the path of emission reductions, and we'll see about 2035. But I guess my bottom line message is, never say never, but it would take very significant technology evolution. Jeremy Tonet : That's a very helpful economic context. I appreciate that. And just one last one, if I could. Just to clarify here. I might have missed it here, but could you confirm if the guide -- the 7% to 8% guide is based off the $3.73, if that's how we should be thinking about the CAGR here? Gale Klappa : Yes, it's based off the midpoint of our 2020 original guidance, which is $3.73. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Just a... Gale Klappa : Your technology may not be doing so good, Michael. Operator, unfortunately, I think Michael cut off there. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : I have two for you. One is, well, one may be for others on the team, one for you. Just curious, for you, there are lots of states that are talking about or putting out restrictions on gas distribution, customer demand growth or that would impact gas distribution volumetric growth. I guess my question for you is, a, what's your view on that in general? It's clearly had an impact on kind of the pure play gas utilities out in the market, but also just how investors and how policymakers are thinking about gas distribution businesses? And are you seeing any of that type of activity in the states you serve? Gale Klappa : Short answer -- and it's a good question, Michael. Short answer is no. In fact, I believe, in one of the states we serve, there is -- someone is drafting legislation to make sure there is never a ban on the use of natural gas, particularly for home heating.  A couple of thoughts along those lines. And I'm happy to have Kevin, Xia, Scott, give you their view or add to anything that I might say. First of all, the region we serve, our 4 state area with natural gas. Well, let me give you an example. It's going to get according to the weather forecast. 32 below in international falls Minnesota this Sunday. There is not a heat pump in the world or one under development that could keep you warm at 32 below. So the market share for natural gas heating in each of the 4 states where we provide natural gas is huge. And on average -- in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, on average, it's almost a 70% market share. So natural gas for home heating has about a 70% market share. There is a reason for that. It's cost-effective. It's convenient. It's clean. And in these kind of climates, natural gas is really the best alternative.  Now looking way down the road and some have said, well, maybe hydrogen will take the place of natural gas. Well, you still have to get the hydrogen from -- you still have to get the hydrogen to the customers. And as difficult as it would be as difficult as permitting it is as difficult as it is to build infrastructure in this country today, I can't imagine it's practical to develop an entirely new distribution network.  And technologically, we believe, with some slight changes, natural gas distribution network could carry hydrogen fuel. So my sense is that the fear about the future of natural gas is a bit overblown, maybe way overblown. But in a climate like ours, the upper Midwest, natural gas is going to be an important product, I believe, for many years to come. And Scott, we're still seeing very strong customer growth on the natural gas delivery side of the business. Scott Lauber : Yes, that's correct, Gale. In fact, we are still seeing, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, about 1% new customer growth, and we saw a large customer even switch over in the fall from using coal in their industrial process over to natural gas. So we're still seeing really good growth on the customer side and natural gas. Joseph Fletcher : I don't also we're seeing conversions from propane still as well. So in our geographic area, gas will be a part of our future for the near future. Gale Klappa : That's a very good point. If you look at market share, I mentioned about a 70% market share for natural gas, propane is in our 4 states, the next most used fuel source. So yes, and people are moving off of propane over to our gas distribution network. Michael, I hope that responds. Michael Lapides : No, that's super helpful. Just one quick follow-up. Whether organically, meaning via growing the rate base faster than your current plan or inorganically, would you be willing to help the mix of the earnings power of the company even more towards being more towards gas versus electric? Gale Klappa : Michael, you never say never, but when I think about capital allocation and when the four of us, when Xia, Scott and Kevin and I look at our opportunities with our team, we see so many significant investment opportunities on the electric side. But I don't -- practically, I think our set of investment opportunities is even greater as electrification continues and as the push towards renewables continues. So again, you never say never, but our investment opportunity set, I think, is even more significant on the electric side. That's where our capital allocation will continue to grow. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then last one, if you pardon me. Can you ever disclosed or would you disclose what you think your excess balance sheet capacity is? Meaning how much incremental more investment, whether on the infrastructure segment or at the core utilities in Wisconsin or Illinois or elsewhere, how much incremental investment could you make with your current balance sheet and expected balance sheet before it would require you to seek other external financing that's not just debt financing? Gale Klappa : So how much more can we do if we were to issue more equity or not issue more equity? Michael Lapides : Yes. I guess, not issue equity. Like do you have excess balance sheet capacity? Do you have the ability to raise your capital plan without actually having the issue? Gale Klappa : Well, I'm going to ask Xia to give her view of this as well. I'll give you my overall kind of high level opinion, and that is that we try to marry our capital plan against 3 very important criteria. The first is what is the need? I mean, we're in a -- most of our assets are regulated assets. You have to prove the need to make those investments. So number one, what is the need?  Number two, how do you finance it and maintain the solid credit metrics that we strive to maintain and have maintained. As you know, we have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry, and we intend to keep it that way. And then number three, if there were an opportunity, would it require more equity, but long story short, we really try -- we really try to balance the need and the financing to maintain the kind of credit quality. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes, I totally agree. I think I would just add 2 more thoughts. One is, WEC, you heard me say all the utilities met the financial goals in 2020. Actually, that has been a track record. So in terms of putting money to work, and we deploy $3 billion a year. We earn our allowed ROEs at the utilities, and you generate very healthy internal cash as a result. So that's number one.  Number two, you heard us say that for the WEC infrastructure investments, we're very much focused on using our own tax appetite. We focus on the time horizon when we could get the cash back. And we just tried to take advantage not only the investment opportunity, but also the cash flows. So I think, overall, the combination of strong utility performance and the ability to recover the cash from the WEC infrastructure investment, I think, really allows us to continue to be on the trajectory that we have been on. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just a question in Wisconsin related to the coal shutdowns and regulatory treatment. Could you just remind us what you've done so far with that? And would something related to that potentially be in your stay-out agreement? And how you're kind of thinking about that overall? Gale Klappa : Yes. Good question, Steve. First of all, if we were to come to a stay-out agreement, it would not involve any discussion or any delineation of a retirement of coal plants because it's outside of the rate case window right now. So again, we're talking about 2023, 2024 for the majority of the retirements that we're talking about, including the one of Columbia that was just announced by Alliant. So there would be no need to address the coal plant retirements in any kind of a stay-out arrangement, if I'm making any sense to you.  Secondly, if you think about what we have done, so we've retired a fair amount of capacity already. We've retired, I think, 65% of our coal-fired capacity since about 2015. And in essence, the unrecovered book balance of those plants has been fully recovered with the exception of $100 million of unrecovered book balance at Plaza Prairie, which is a large coal-fired power plant in Southeastern Wisconsin. That was our most recent retirement. That $100 million is being securitized, in fact, expect to be -- to have a securitization offering this year. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Great. And just one other question is on -- we're going to have a new FERC ultimately Democrat majority. And I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on whether there could be another change in transmission policy or ROEs? Or you think it will stay relatively stable? Gale Klappa : Steve, I'm guessing relatively stable, if not up. And the reason for that is, when you talk to -- as we have, when you talk to people early now in the Biden administration, there is enormous focus on incentivizing renewable development, as you know, an enormous focus. And I think the point he is that we will see that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I'm guessing, we'll fully understand that you're not going to reach the administration's goals for renewable development without further incentivizing transmission development. Those 2 go hand-in-hand, chicken and egg. I mean, it's got to be done. So it would be almost counter to a huge tailwind to public policy to try to do anything from here that would not continue the return incentives for needed transmission. So my guess is that the overriding public policy will keep things stable or -- at least stable, if not positive at FERC. Operator : Your next question comes from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo. Neil Kalton : I'm just curious, EVs have been a pretty hot topic recently, right? All in the news. And I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about your investment opportunity around EVs. How soon you need to start planning for the system? Is this 8 to 10 years out? Are there going to be quicker knees? Just any kind of insight into how you're thinking about it? Gale Klappa : Okay. Great question, Neil. Well, first of all, the current governor and the current gubernatorial administration here in Wisconsin has a very keen understanding that in order for the state to continue to make progress on CO2 reductions, there has to be a much stronger pickup in terms of electric vehicle penetration. I've heard that. I mean, I've had probably 3 discussions with the governor about this, and he really, really believes that's the case. So do I. So long story short, we have -- there are 2 things going on. First of all, we have filed a modest proposal for EV infrastructure that's pending before the Wisconsin Commission right now. And in addition to that, the Wisconsin Commission has opened up or is opening up a generic proceeding. What is it they should be broadly looking at to try to advance the governor's objective of an accelerated pickup in electric vehicle market share. So very early right now, but we do have a pilot that we've suggested that's getting regulatory review right now. And Scott, do you want to give just a couple of details on that filing? Scott Lauber : Yes. So we've got a pilot out there. It's about $50 million. We provide a couple of alternatives on how to also support some of the lower income areas of the state that maybe all to help put some of that infrastructure or support that, whether it's through buses or some other ideas there. So it's in the really early stages, but it would be somewhat of a rebate program that would help actually put some chargers in individual houses. Gale Klappa : So early days. Scott Lauber : Kevin? Joseph Fletcher : Some of our larger customers who are looking at the EVs and looking at what they want to do in their fleet longer term, so we've got a close relationship with them, and we'll continue doing that in the day-to-day. Gale Klappa : Kevin makes a good point. We've actually seen a pickup, and we're advising a number of our larger commercial customers who are either thinking about switching over to an all-electric fleet or who have other needs as EV penetration begins to pick up. So again, very early days. I don't think you'd see any major impact on our earnings in terms of EV penetration in our region, probably until very late in the 2020s. Joseph Fletcher : And I'll add a statistic that I looked at here recently. Present day electric CO2 emissions at 34%. Transportation, which we're just talking about, is 37%. So just a little bit more already today. Gale Klappa : Yes. Kevin is making a good point. Both in our region and nationally, the utilities have done so much that essentially, transportation is now the largest contributor to CO2. It has surpassed or we've cut more. And so transportation is now the largest contributor, not the utility industry. I'm sorry, Neil, go ahead. Operator : And your final question comes from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Can you hear me this time? Gale Klappa : We can. Michael Weinstein : A quick question about the extension of the ITC and the PTC that just got passed in December. And it looks like it -- there is a decent chance you might have any further extensions going forward. Could we -- I guess, the increased economic benefits from the tax credit extensions? Could that change your view on the targeted business mix between infrastructure and utilities? Could you increase your desire for more projects? Gale Klappa : It's a great question, Michael. I will tell you this. We have really tailored up to now. We've really tailored our appetite, no pun intended, for growing the infrastructure business. We've tailored that to 2 things. The availability of very high-quality projects with strong credit quality offtakers, but also our own tax appetite. So to the extent that our tax appetite is what we projected it to be, and the pace of that business growth will be exactly what we've talked about. On the other hand, we were just talking about this the other day, actually. If we see an increase in the corporate income tax, which some have proposed, as you know, as part of the Biden plan, then we might have a stronger tax appetite. And if you couple that, meaning a stronger tax appetite, with the extension of these ITCs and PTCs, there may be a greater opportunity there. But long story short, all of that would have to fall in place. Right now, we're working on the plan we laid out. Michael Weinstein : That makes total sense. One other question, too. If you do get a 1-year delay for the rate filing, would that -- could we expect to see like an increased target for O&M savings this year beyond what Scott laid out earlier in the call? Gale Klappa : No. No. Because remember that, that is all about 2022. All right. Well, I believe that's our final question for the day. We really appreciate you taking part in our conference call. Thank you again for participating. And if you have any more questions, if you'll clear the contact Beth Straka on direct line, which she gives out to only a few of you. Her direct line 414-221-4639. Thanks, everybody. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news released this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $1.61 a share. As always, our focus on operating excellence was a major factor in our performance. In addition, we saw the positive impact of colder weather and economic recovery in our region. Xia will provide you with more details on our metrics in just a few minutes. But first, a comment about the polar vortex events that we experienced in February, our people and our infrastructure were put to the test literally, and performed remarkably during that bitter cold stretch when temperatures dropped to minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area. I am pleased to report that the investments we've made in our energy grid and our diverse fuel mix get the economy moving and our customers safe and warm. Now as you know, just over a year has passed since we first saw the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our commitment to safety, efficiency and reliability has only been enhanced by the operational challenges we faced. Our company today stands stronger than ever, and our $16.1 billion capital plan, the largest in company history is on track. Over the next five years, we expect our investment plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it will bolster our sustainability as we continue to invest in renewable energy and state of the art infrastructure. In fact, the potential we see in renewables and battery storage, the progress we've made across our system already and supportive public policy have allowed us to step back and reassess our future environmental goals. So today, I'm pleased to announce that we're setting even more aggressive targets for the next several years. Our goal is now a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025, and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units, some operating refinements and the use of existing technology as we continue to execute our capital plan. And of course, our long-term goal remains net zero carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050. In addition, on the natural gas distribution side of our business, we're now targeting net zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. Our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and incorporate renewable natural gas into our system will clearly help us achieve this 2030 milestone. You'll be able to read more about these goals in our updated climate report. We'll be launching that report on our website tomorrow morning. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're making really good headway on our capital plan. We call it our ESG progress plan. Since our last visit with you we've announced four renewable projects for our regulated business in Wisconsin, and another wind project the Jayhawk Wind Farm at our WEC Infrastructure segment, Scott and Kevin are on tap to fill you in on the details. I will add two important points about the impact of our ESG progress plan. As we continue to reshape our asset mix, we project that less than 10% of our revenues and less than 10% of our assets will be tied to coal by the end of 2025. And we would more than triple our investment in renewables across our enterprise. You put it all together, and we expect to deliver among the best risk adjusted returns the industry has to offer. We have strong credit quality and no need to issue equity. At the heart of it all is our ability to deliver the affordable, reliable and clean energy that our customers depend on. Now switching gears for a moment, let's take a quick look at the regional economy. With the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccinations well underway, we're seeing more signs of economic recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands today at 3.8%. That's close to pre pandemic levels and more than a percentage point better than the national average. In addition, our recent business survey by the University of Wisconsin confirmed that all core indicators from productivity to income are looking up. Also, you may have seen the announcement last week that Foxconn has reached a new agreement with the state of Wisconsin regarding Foxconn High Tech campus south of Milwaukee. The agreement provides for up to $80 million of performance based incentives. If Foxconn hires 1,454 qualified workers and invest $672 billion by 2026. It also importantly gives Foxconn the flexibility to be responsive to the marketplace. This time the Foxconn campus is expected to focus on producing computer servers and server parts. That's one of Foxconn specialties. In fact, we understand that Foxconn supplies approximately 40% of the worldwide market for servers. Foxconn also noted that over time, it plans to make the Wisconsin site, one of the largest if not the largest manufacturer of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So as business opportunities continue to arise, Foxconn will work with the state on contract changes that would incorporate additional jobs and more new investment beyond this agreement. As we look further across our service area, we see numerous green shoots of growth. For example, Green Bay packaging just completed a $500 million expansion of its paper mill in northeastern Wisconsin, Amazon continues to expand. That company just announced another fulfillment center. This one will be located in one of our western suburbs. And Uline is growing again. Building two new distribution warehouses in the Kenosha area south of Milwaukee with a projected investment of $130 million. If you're not familiar with the name, Uline is one of the nation's leading distributors of shipping, industrial and packaging materials. So with all the developments we're seeing in the ground, we remain optimistic about the growth of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segment, Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Turning now to sales, we continued to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 7,000 more electric customers and 25,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis beginning at page 10 of the earnings packet. In Wisconsin, we saw sales growth on a weather normal basis across our entire retail business compared to the first quarter of 2020. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.2%. This excludes gas use for power generation. And on a weather normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased by 0.5 of 1%. Retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were up 1.1% from the first quarter of 2020. And on a weather normal basis, were at 1.4%. Overall, our growth is tracking ahead of our forecasts as the economy begins to open up. As we announced in March, we are adding another project to our infrastructure segment, we acquired a 90% ownership interest in the Jayhawk wind farm. This project will be built in Kansas and consists of 70 worth wind turbines with a combined capacity of more than 190 megawatts. Jayhawk is expected to go in service by the end of this year. This project fits our investment criteria well as a long-term offtake agreement with Facebook for all the energy produced; we plan to invest $302 million for the 90% ownership interest and substantially all the tax benefits. As a reminder, our Thunderhead Wind investment is now projected to go on service by year end. We now have seven wind projects announced during operations in our infrastructure segment. This represents $1.9 billion of investment with a strong pipeline of opportunities ahead; we expect to invest an additional $1.5 billion in this segment to 2025.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Scott. Our COVID-19 statistics have been improving in our service areas. We remain focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. We continue to realize efficiencies across our system of companies. And we'll apply the lessons learned as we design workforce and practices post pandemic.  Now, let me touch on some recent developments in our ESG progress plan. Since our last call, we announced four large scale renewable projects for our Wisconsin utilities. The Paris, Darien and Koshkonong Solar-Battery Park, as well as the Red Barn Wind Park. In total, our shares of these projects would provide 675 megawatts of solar generation, 316 megawatts of battery storage and 82 megawatts of wind. Pending other Commission's approval, we will invest approximately $1.5 billion to bring them online between 2022 and 2024. We expect these projects to deliver significant operating cost savings and maintain reliability. These projects, of course, are all part of our plans to invest significant capital dollars in renewables and battery storage for utilities between 2021 and 2025. More to come in the next few months. We are also proposing to build 128 megawatts of generation at our existing Western power plant site in North Wisconsin. The new facility will use seven reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them rice units. If approved, we expect to invest $170 million in this project for targeted in service date in 2023. On the natural gas distribution side, WEC Energy is making its way through the approval process for two liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters And the approval, which we anticipate by the end of this year, we would expect to bring the facilities in operations late in 2023.  Now for a few regulatory updates. On March the 30th, we filed a request for the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to forego a rate case filing this year after we reached an agreement with the major customer and environmental groups. We look forward to the Commission's decision in 60 to 90 days. At this time, we're in the midst of rate reviews at two of our smaller utilities, North Shore gas and Michigan gas utilities. These proceedings are to support important investments in our distribution infrastructure. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Kevin, thank you very much. As we look to the remainder of the year, assuming normal weather, we expect to reach the top end of our earnings guidance for 2021. That stands at $3.99 a share to $4.03 a share. We're also reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth in a range of 5% to 7% a year. And as you may recall, in January, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6575 that was an increase of 7.1% over the previous quarterly rate. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We are in the middle of that range now so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now Xia will provide you with more details on our financials and our second quarter guidance show. Xia? Xia Liu : Thanks Gale. Our 2021 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our favorable results for the first quarter of 2021 were driven by a number of factors. These included the continued execution of our capital plan, colder winter weather conditions, stronger weather normalized sales, increased production tax credits, lower interest expense, and continued emphasis on operating efficiency. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter results on page 14. I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2020. First quarter winter weather conditions when compared to the first quarter of last year drove a $0.05 increase in earnings. Also rate adjustments and weather normalized sales added $0.05compared to the first quarter of 2020. Negative drivers included $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and $0.02 increase in day to day O&M expense. The increase in O&M expense was more than offset by the favorable performance of our Rabbi trust performance. Rabbi trust investment included in the corporate and other segments. Overall, we added $0.04 quarter-over-quarter from utility operation. Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company, we picked up a $0.01 related to continued capital investment. Recall that our investment is now earning a return on equity of 10.52%. We are aware of the recent proposal to remove incentive ROE adders for RTO membership. With that ATC would lose the 50 basis point ROE adder on an annualized basis, it would be a $0.02 earnings drag for WEC. Of course, we're watching the developments closely. Earning at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily from production tax credit related to wind farm acquisition. These include the Blooming Grove Wind Farm placing service in December 2020 and the Tatanka Ridge Wind Farm, which came online in early January. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segments increased $0.11 driven by improved Rabbi trust investment performance, some favorable tax items resolved in the quarter, and lower interest expense. In summary, we improved on our first quarter 2020 performance by $0.18 per share. Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers we project our 2021 effective tax rate would be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on page six of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $295 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first quarter of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. The spike in natural gas costs came throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with customer arrears contributed to the increase in working capital, however, with normal collection practices underway in our major markets. We expect working capital to improve throughout the remainder of the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $590 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $94 million increase from 2020. On the financing front, with the $600 million holdco issuance in March, along with our refinancing efforts last year, the average interest rate on our holdco senior note is now 1.8% compared to 3.5% a year ago. This will continue to provide a favorable interest variance throughout the year. In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. For the quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.75 to $0.77 per share. This account for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.76 cents per share in the second quarter last year. Excluding $0.03 of better than normal weather and a $0.03 pickup from a FERC ROE decision, we would have earned $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Gale mentioned earlier, we are guiding to the top end of our range for the full year. And as a reminder that range is $3.99 per share to $4.03per share. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.  With that I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we are now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. ShahriarPourreza: Hey, good afternoon, guys. GaleKlappa: You are still on your unidentified bunker in Jersey, Shar? ShahriarPourreza: That's right. That's right, undetermined when I go back. But yes, that's correct. Hope you're well, Gale. Excellent. So, Gale just the policy question. And then just the fundamental question in a second. But we've seen some movement in Illinois on sort of the policy front saw Pritzker come out last week against the QIP again, you seem more skeptical on the prospects for legislation this spring? Can you maybe share sort of the data points that have been moving around any updated thoughts there? And anything on the dialogue around the QIP? GaleKlappa: Sure, I'll be happy to, Shar. Well, first of all, as you know, there are numerous competing bills now on the energy front, in Illinois. And there's an old country song that says a long way to go and a short time to get there. And that's kind of I think the situation in Illinois, coupled with the fact that not only is the time running out in terms of the length of the legislative session, but also understanding is what's legislator over the budget for Illinois, which has been historically contemptuous, contentious, and redistricting. So there is a lot on their plate. And we'll see what happens. But the number of competing bills, lots of discussion going on, we'll see if anything really does take place. But I would remind everyone, that the focus remains very much on the electric side of the business there, which were not involved with potential subsidies for Exelon's nuclear plants. So there are lots of things going on there. And I suspect that rider for example, that we have at people's gas, it is not necessarily the major focus of what's going on right now we'll see. But again, even if that rider were to be repealed, and I don't really think it will, then we would revert all of the utilities would simply revert to normal rate cases with forward looking test periods. So time will tell but we're not overly concerned at the moment, in terms of the future of what needs to be done in Illinois. ShahriarPourreza: Terrific, and then maybe probably a question more for Scott and Xia. But with a strong start to the year, it is clearly you guys highlighted in your prepared remarks. Is it too early, kind of in your view to discuss potentially pulling some O&M forward? Is that something that you could look to do, the performance keeps up? So how do we sort of think about that? GaleKlappa: Well, I'd be happy to have Scott and Xia have their view. I will say this; we got a lot of year ahead, including a large quarter in the summer quarter. So we'll have to see. I think what weather bodes for. I mean, Scott, I would think the biggest swing we're looking at potentially is weather in the summer. ScottLauber: Yes, you're exactly right. As you think about the summer months, July and August, are the biggest month during the summer. And what we'll do is just like we did last year; we'll keep monitoring it and look at our stuff every day. And as you get closer nearly end of the year, we definitely have lists of projects going both ways. The weather doesn't come through or also weather does come. So we'll continue to look at it but it's a long ways but yes before we can do that. GaleKlappa: I will say Scott and Xia have a list on there, checking it twice. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Smith with Bank of America. JulienSmith: Hey, thanks for the time guys. Listen, you all are announcing quite a bit on the regulated investment front of late. Nice details on the call just now. Just curious as to how you think about the targets itself, right obviously doing well on the year. And have you thought about the longer data targets, I think you had 800 megawatts of solar, 600 storage, 100 a wind? And obviously you've articulated the preponderance of these targets already. So just curious you, again, admittedly, you're just well on track, or is there actually some potential upsides these as best you see, I'm just curious how you would frame that? GaleKlappa: Well, we'll let Kevin give you his view on that as well. But I will say this, remember that much of what we want to accomplish in terms of adding renewables for this five year period, we want to have in service in 2023, and 2020, those of the years where we would retire some older, particularly the older units at our Oak Creek campus, those are the years when we would retire the older, less efficient coal fired capacity. So my view is we're ahead of schedule, in terms of announcing these projects. And as Kevin said, more to come. But again, thinking about the gestation period, the approval period, and the construction period. And I think, as you said, there'll be more to come, but I would see us as slightly ahead of schedule, but the schedule being intact. KevinFletcher: Gale just underscore that we are a bit ahead of schedule. But again, as I said in prepared remarks, there will be more to come because there are other opportunities out there that we're evaluating. So stay tuned. JulienSmith: Excellent. And if I can, maybe to follow up on the last question here, in obviously doing well in '21 here. How would you frame the longer-term sales forecast here, the 1% to 1.3% sales growth for '20 through '25? Because obviously Foxconn plays into some of that math. You alluded to it a moment ago in your prepared remarks, as well as obviously some of the, I believe you've seen some residential tailwinds here. Can you elaborate a little bit on how that kind of fits the puts and takes against your longer term? GaleKlappa: Yes, I'll be happy to and I'm also going to ask Scott to give you his view. But first, let me address something that I think is not particularly well understood about the Foxconn situation, because I think it's important in terms of how it plays into our sales forecast. So we talked about the revised agreement with the state. Importantly, that agreement with the state runs through basically 2026. The earlier the first agreement that Foxconn had with the state was a much longer term agreement. So it would be a mistake to think that what's on the table now, where Foxconn has clear line of visibility on what they will produce at the campus. It's a mistake to think that that's all there is. In fact, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Foxconn is still saying that their aspirational goal is to make this campus one of the largest producers of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So the door is wide open for future projects beyond this period. And again, the first agreement the state had with Foxconn ran more than 10 years. This agreement is shorter term and deliberately so but does not preclude additional long term investment. In fact, the doors open for additional long term investment at that campus. Having said all that, when I and Scott view our sales forecast that we publicly announced, that's pretty darn and solid. ScottLauber: Yes, that looks exactly right, Gale, when you look at our sales forecast, that 1% to 1.3% growth in those years, feel so good about that, because all the projects that we have announced, are still there and still developing. In fact, we're even talking about Uline today on the call. So feeling good about that. And I think in the past, we've talked about that growth in southeastern Wisconsin, over a $1 billion of new development beyond the projects that we have listed, and that continues to grow. So and feeling good about the forecast overall, I'm really happy where the quarter came in. JulienSmith: Inclusive of that residential tailwind, actually, if I can elaborate this or ask you to elaborate in a quickly on southeast Wisconsin, reshoring is a major topic focus on manufacturing domestically here. Any other comments on additional new development or nascent efforts on that front? GaleKlappa: Short answer is yes, none that I can give names to at the moment, but I will tell you, and as you know, I've been involved in economic development here for a number of years, through the Milwaukee 7 which is our Regional Economic Development Initiative. I will tell you that our, the number of prospects, particularly from a high tech manufacturing standpoint, the number of prospects looking at this area. I've not seen this robust in any time that I've been here and it's close to 20 years that I've been back in Wisconsin. So again, that gives us a lot of optimism about the regional economy, about the attractiveness of Wisconsin as a manufacturing center. And, as they say, in the UK, watch this space. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. DurgeshChopra: Hey, good afternoon, Gale thanks for taking my question doing well, thank you. Great quarter, Xia, maybe just on the quarter, can you help us reconcile the 161 to guidance? It's weather and better COVID related sales trends, but can you just quantify those pieces? And if I'm missing anything else? XiaLiu: Yes, sure. So overall, the weather was kind of in line with the guidance, I think what came in a little better for several things. One is we would resolve older tax item, historical tax item. So that can mean better. And we were a little bit conservative on O&M and interest saving, and PTC. So overall, just all the business units performed better than what we guided. DurgeshChopra: Got it. So weather was normal, it was more so driven by this tax item and just O&M interest expense coming lower than expected. Can you quantify the tax item for us? XiaLiu: So it's about $0.04, $0.03 to $0.04 better than what we guided on. DurgeshChopra: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Just and quick clarification. And that's all I have, Gale; you said the Wisconsin rate case 60 to 90 days. That is from your sort of the date of the filing or from here on when are you expecting a final outcome there? GaleKlappa: Well, obviously, the commission staff is going through its normal process now. And the 60 to 90 days would be basically from the date of our filing. That's our projection. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. JeremyTonet: Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. Maybe just starting off here. I was just wondering if you could comment on the Biden plan here and how you see that potentially impacting your ESG progress plan. And do you see any impacts on infrastructure investments or associate opportunity over time? Does this kind of change how you think about things here? Or even on the transmission sides? Granted, early innings and things can change a lot just any thoughts? I was curious. GaleKlappa: And good question, Jeremy. I think our overall view probably can be summarized in maybe three points. First is way too early to tell. As you can imagine, you can imagine the sausage making and the concessions and the changes that are going to take place over the course of I think an extended period of debate, particularly to craft something that could get through the Senate. So I think overall, again, probably way too early to tell. However, there are a couple of things that seem to have very strong consensus, the first I think, would be very beneficial not only to our industry, but to our company in specific. And that's the extension of the production tax credits, the investment tax credits, the application of tax credits to battery storage, and the additional drive toward continuing to incentivize renewables. That obviously will be extremely helpful going forward. And I suspect just based on everything we're seeing and hearing and as we talked to folks in Washington, I think those particular items have very strong consensus and support. In addition to that, I don't think there's any question that if all of the, if all of these tax credits continue to be extended and applied across the board, as we expect there will be, there will continue to be more renewable development, which is helpful to us particularly in terms of our infrastructure segment, and actually our regulated segment as well, but also a continued drive toward expansion of transmission. And as you may have seen, and Kevin has got some very specific statistics. MISO has made a very interesting projection for the next 20 years on how much additional investment just in the mid, the MISO mid footprint that they project for additional transmission that would support renewables. Kevin? KevinFletcher: Yes, Gale, if you look at the MISO, it was long transmission plans, they suggest a $30 billion to $100 billion potential transmission investment over that 10 to 20 year period that Gale mentioned, we'll know more about that later in the year, but certainly that's good for ATC and for us. GaleKlappa: Jeremy, I hope that helps to answer your question at this point. JeremyTonet: That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, appreciating that the ROE hit is small for you. Just wondering what your thoughts are on first proposed transmission incentive changes against the backdrop of wanting to increase transmission development for optimizing renewable deployment? GaleKlappa: Well, on the surface, the reduction of the ROE adder or a 50 basis point reduction on the surface, it really doesn't seem to be supportive of the overall broad public policy of the administration. But I continue to believe that the tailwind of public policy will move FERC in a direction of setting allowed ROEs for transmission companies that are at least at or above the retail allowed ROEs in most states. I still believe that would be the case. So we'll see how in course, this is a proposed, we'll see how all that shakes out. And again, minor hit to us. But I really think that at the end of the day, the FERC policy is going to have to be reflective of the administration's broader policy on renewables, which must mean incentivizing transmission. JeremyTonet: Got it. It makes sense. And just the last one, if I could, as you mentioned, at the onset of the call, there appears to be renewed focus on an attention on resilience in reliability in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri, and we saw intertwining impacts across the energy economy here. Do you see this impacting your service territory and investment opportunity? Even just thinking about line five is kind of a high profile example here where your state appears somewhat at odds with this focus? If you have any thoughts you could share here, that'd be helpful. GaleKlappa: Yes, I'd be happy to. Well, first of all, bedrock of our entire approach to managing this business and serving customers has been resilience and reliability. As I mentioned earlier, that focus that execution came through in spades, when the polar vortex event associated with Yuri when temperatures hit minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area. So at the level, I think our Public Service Commission, I think, the gubernatorial administration, there, they've been very supportive of resilience and reliability. And that, for example, is another reason why just to make to maintain resilience and reliability in very difficult climates during the winter. It's another reason why we're optimistic that we'll get approval for the LNG storage facilities that we have before the Public Service Commission today. So I don't see state policy, particularly Public Service Commission positions in any way being at odds with resilience or reliability in our region. In fact, I think the recent events just underscore how important that is. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. MichaelWeinstein: Hey, Gale, Scott, how you doing? I hope you guys are well. I'm doing good. We're getting into the summer, right. Everything is going to get better in the summer, so feeling great, feeling much better. Much better year than last year, hopefully. GaleKlappa: Just crank up your area. It's all good. MichaelWeinstein: Yes, exactly. Hey, your asset growth projections through 2025, previously is 7% right now you're talking about ramping up the carb or the greenhouse gas reduction goals, right through that period between 2025 and 2030. Does that increase that asset growth rate at all during that period? And also, does that mean that you might be at the higher end of the ETS growth range as well. GaleKlappa: I think there are probably two pieces to the answer to that question. And our capital plan and our $16.1 billion ESG progress plan from now through 2025. That is unchanged based on the announcements that we've made today. Now, as you know, we refresh and we update our capital plan every fall going into the, I conference and on our analysts call in late October, early November. So we'll have a refreshed five year capital plan going forward, and we'll take a look to see whether or not there may be some additional investment upsides associated with the continuing progress we're making on co2 and methane reduction. But the short answer is for this particular five year period 2021 through 2025, no change. MichaelWeinstein: Okay. And those reductions or those targets are across the enterprise, or is that just the utilities? GaleKlappa: Well, no, first of all, with our wind projects and the infrastructure segment, how many co2 you saw. This would relate specifically to our operating utilities. MichaelWeinstein: Okay, I guess I'm thinking about it the wrong way. I'm thinking about percentage of renewable assets along those lines. And then one question for Xia, this is more technical, but with the rabbi trust up $0.04 and O&M down $0.02. Does that mean that essentially O&M was not related to the rabbi trust; it was reduced by $0.02? XiaLiu: Yes, it's not exactly dollar for dollar, but directionally you're exactly right. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. MichaelLapides: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I have a couple just I want to make sure I understand some of the environmental targets you're trying to hit. Is what you're basically saying, Gale, or Kevin is that you think by the end of 2025, the only remaining coal plants you'll probably have still operating or the old Oak Creek plant, the Elm Road plant that's part of power the future? And maybe Western 4 and everything else probably shut down by then. GaleKlappa: Really, the two campuses that would remain are the new Oak Creek units and the Weston side. You're exactly right. MichaelLapides: But just Weston 4 or kind of or other unit, I forget what else is there whether one of the older units is there as operating as well? GaleKlappa: Scott, there is Weston 3 ScottLauber : Yes, both Weston 3 and Weston 4 will still be operating. MichaelLapides: Got it. Okay. And then, I guess my second question is, when you're thinking about the non regulated the energy infrastructure segment, it seems that you've had a lot of opportunities to come in and kind of buy projects from developers. Just curious how that landscape is changing, if at all, given the fact that lot of your peers, you were an early mover, but lots of your peers among the large cap regulated utilities in the Midwest. They're all kind of trying to compete and buy a lot of the same projects as well. So I'm just curious if returns on that business are being competed downward, given the factor more bidders, whether it's Amerens or AEPs or some of your other neighbors, or whether just the landscape is so big, there's so many projects we haven't gotten to that point yet. GaleKlappa: I'm chuckling Michael, because I remember you were asking a question earlier on your email about the Memphis Grizzlies as well. And it reminded me of a comment from Coach Bud here with the Bucks who said this is a copycat lead, we steal from each other. So I think some of our brother may be stealing from our early idea, which is just fine. But the truth of matter is we have not seen any kind of for us our pipeline of potential projects that we are taking a look at. And being very, very careful with our due diligence, that pipeline of additional projects is as robust as it's ever been. And the returns, again, as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks on the Jayhawk project that we just announced, returns are as good as we expected them to be. So we haven't seen any diminution of either potential project opportunities or the financial metrics at this stage of the game. And I don't expect we will. MichaelLapides: Got it. And then one last one, just curious. It's been a little quiet in the sector on the M&A front. And just how are you thinking about kind of this point in time for utility M&A in general, relative to kind of other cycles that you've seen in your history, Gale? GaleKlappa: Oh, gosh, that's a great question, Michael. We've seen two or three cycles over the last 30 years or so driven by different motivations, I think. So I'm not sure that comparing the cycles is necessarily the right thing to do, because I think the motivations for the M&A were different. Having said all of that, longer term, I still believe we're in a consolidating industry. I still believe that scale matters. The good news is we have significant scale and continuing efficiency opportunities. But I think over time, you'll probably see a different form of M&A at least in my opinion than what you saw over the last five or six years. I think less in terms of premiums and more in terms of mergers of equal type opportunities, scale still does matter growth still does matter. Efficiencies still does matter. So we've clearly seen a low as you probably would expect going through a pandemic. I don't think there's going to be a giant uptick immediately in M&A in our industry. But over time, I do believe it's still a consolidating industry. But I would suspect that the criteria will be much closer to the ones that we use. And I can just briefly repeat those again if you'd like. And that is we'd have to be convinced after significant due diligence, that an acquisition would be additive or accretive to earnings per share in the first full year after closing. The second is we worked very hard and one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry. And we're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it. And the third is really important as well in that is that you'd have to really believe that the growth rate of anything that we would acquire would be at least as strong as our own organic growth rate. So read that at least 5% to 7% a year. Hope that answers your question, Michael. MichaelLapides: No, that's super helpful. And last point, my kids will hate me for saying this because they're Knicks fans, and they play each other tonight, but Go Grizz. GaleKlappa: Amen. Go Grizz. By the way, you know that the head coach of the Grizzlies used to be on our staff here in Milwaukee, he is a great guy. MichaelLapides: He is a great guy. And he's been -- this year has been a little tough, but they'll turn it. It's early, we got some time. GaleKlappa: Amen. Good luck tonight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. AnthonyCrowdell: Good afternoon. Longtime first time here. Just hopefully, so two maybe high level questions, I guess the first is I think you spoke about maybe less than 10% or 10% of the company's revenues, or I don't know if you said revenues or earnings are going to be from coal assets. I'm just curious, is there something with that figure like? Is there a target 10? Does that include the company to any ESG indices or anything, or how the company comes up with the 10% number? GaleKlappa: Well, we came up with a 10% number simply by doing an accurate estimation with the math. And just to be clear, again, thank you raising an important point, by the end of 2025, we would expect our revenues and our asset base tied to coal will be both are less than 10%. And the reason we wanted to mention that is I think there's perhaps been a perception on some investors, that we still have a very large portion of our asset base types as simply as we reshape our energy and our asset mix. That's simply not the case number one. The other thing that I think is really an important point here is that we can achieve not only the 2025 goal, but also the very aggressive 80% reduction in co2 emissions by the end of 2030 with existing technology, some operating refinements and some retirements. And so that I think gives you a sense of how dynamic are reshaping of our asset mix is and how small the reliance will continue to be obviously, less than 10% by 2025. And we think lower than that by 2030. AnthonyCrowdell: Great, thank you. And lastly, I think a question earlier, you highlighted that the polar vortex you had really highlighted the strength of your infrastructure, and maybe that gives the regulators maybe a tailwind on approving additional programs or capital. I guess if I could put that question around, though, and thinking how strong maybe your fossil infrastructure performs. Does that give the regulators any pause on approving the company's ESG platform? If we think about some are blaming what happened in Texas and maybe fault of some of the renewable projects that were going there? And given how strong your thoughts on infrastructure work this past winter? Does that maybe cause any pause on build out of renewables? GaleKlappa: Great question. And I think the honest answer is we have intelligent and very well informed State Public Service Commission here. And they recognize that basically for, to give you a very specific example, during the polar vortex event in February, we had to have everything running to keep the lights on and the gas flowing everything. The coal units, the nuclear units, the wind farms, the solar, everything had to be operating given the demands that we saw. So to the contrary, I think the diversity of our fuel mix, just -- the way it performed and needed to perform for public safety, I think underscores the fact that we have to have a diverse fuel mix going forward. And clearly, we think we can maintain not only think we know we can maintain reliability by adding this amount of renewables, but it's possible because we have such efficient, strong dispatchable fossil units. So put that all together, and we can still achieve an 80% reduction in co2 and co2 emissions. So I hope that response to your question, Anthony. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank Global. AndrewWeisel: I'm good. Still smarting a little bit from the Bucks beating the nest last night. But we get another chance tomorrow. GaleKlappa: You do? Well, I might not let you ask a question if you're going to root for the nest tomorrow. AndrewWeisel: How about a few questions? So the first one is, you mentioned, first of all, congrats on the new emission reduction targets. That's always good to see. I think you said the 2030 target now will include the use of some existing technologies. Does that include stuff that's available but not yet economic, but you're expecting cost reductions to make it economically to this decade. GaleKlappa: No. I think it includes three things; retirement of older, less efficient units, some operating refinements on the ground, and essentially executing our capital plan to add the renewable mix that we're talking about. But no other technology needed. Pretty cool. AndrewWeisel: Yes, impressive. Could that provide even more upside at some out of the money things become in the money? GaleKlappa:  Possibly, yes, possibly. Certainly. Again, not, I wouldn't expect that to occur between now and 2025. But you never say never for eight or nine or 10 years out. So we will see but yes. AndrewWeisel: Okay, great, then I believe your 2050 goal is net zero from generating in stations. Does that target also include net zero from company operations like offices and vehicle fleets? GaleKlappa: Well, we've got -- the truth of matter is the absolute preponderance of our emissions, our co2 emissions are obviously coming from the operation of our generating fleet, we'll step back. So basically, the goal really just covers the generation fleet. We'll step back and look at our other operations as well. But we have an aggressive program over the course of the next few years, Kevin to add electric vehicles to our to field fleet. KevinFletcher: Oh, that's exactly right, Gale. And we'll continue to do evaluate that over time, and as more vehicles are become available, especially on the commercial side, then our shifting over to EV and our fleets in warehouse equipment will continue as well. But we do have those targets established now. AndrewWeisel: Okay, great. Then just one last one, I just want to clarify on the energy infrastructure. I think you said you spent $1.9 billion and plan to spend another $1.4 billion or sorry $1.5 billion. Rather, that would be a total of $3.4 billion. Your guidance for the five year period is 2.2. Is that an increase? Are you simply including stuff from before the '21 to '25 period? GaleKlappa: Now we're including some things from the past. And I think the key to look at there is the additional $1.5 billion that we will still allocate to this segment between now and the end of 2025. And of course, we're way ahead of schedule, which is good news. AndrewWeisel: Okay, but you're sticking to 2.2 for '21 to '25, right? GaleKlappa: That's our story, and we're sticking to it, Andrew. AndrewWeisel: Just to be sure that, am I correct to assume that doesn't include any potential changes from DC around either corporate tax policy or renewable tax credits? GaleKlappa: You're correct. That assumes status quo. Gale Klappa : Well folks, this concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating. If you have any more questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka. She can be reached at 414-221-4639 Thanks, everybody. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Second Quarter 2021 results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time.  Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC's Energy Group's latest Form 10-K, and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissions could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.  After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce -- Peter Feigin : Excuse me. I'd like to interrupt just for a minute. I'm Peter Feigin, President of the NBA Champion Milwaukee Bucks. And I can tell you firsthand in a big way that you can't have a truly great NBA team without an incredible energy company to power you up. So, I'm proud to introduce a personal friend, one of the terrific minority owners of the Bucks, and the Chairman of one of the best energy companies in America, Gale Klappa. Go Bucks and go WEC. Gale Klappa : Oh, my goodness, wonders never cease. Peter, thank you so much for dropping by, and congratulations from all of us to the world champion, Milwaukee Bucks. And I'm not sure I can top all of that, but no pun intended, let's give it a shot. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team. Here with me today, we have Kevin Fletcher, our President, and CEO, Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.87 a share.  Xia will provide you with more details in just a few minutes. But given our strong performance through the first half of this year, we're raising our annual guidance. The new range is $4.02 a share to $4.05 a share. And our expectation is that we will reach the top end of that range. As always, this assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Now, as we look across our business lines, I'm pleased to report that every segment is performing at a high level. Our Companies continue to deliver superior reliability and customer satisfaction. The solid economic recovery in Wisconsin with commercial and industrial expansion gives us confidence in our projected sales growth. Our balance sheet is strong. We have no need to issue new equity to fund our ESG progress plan. And our plan is well on track for both our regulated and our infrastructure segments. You may know we expect our ESU progress plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it's bolstering our sustainability as we invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art technology.  A good example of our progress is the announcement we made just a week ago, about a $400-million investment in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center. Scott will provide you with more detail on this development in just a moment. But I'll tell you that the offtake agreement is with one of the largest high-tech companies in the world, and we expect the project to meet or exceed all of our financial metrics. We've also made great progress on our plan to build 1800 megawatts of regulated solar, wind, and battery storage. This carbon-free asset will play a significant role in improving our environmental footprint. Recall that back in May, we set near-term goals that are among the most ambitious in the industry. Reducing carbon emissions by 60% from our electric generation fleet by 2025 and achieving an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Going ahead, that we now expect only 8% of our regulated electricity supply to come from coal by the end of 2030. We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units, operating refinements, and the use of existing technology as we execute our ESG progress plan. Of course, our long-term goal remains net 0 carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050. And our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and introduce renewable natural gas into our system will help us achieve another aggressive goal, net 0 methane emissions by 2030. You can learn more about these goals and much more in our corporate responsibility report, which we published just last week. And now let's switch gears a bit and take a quick look at our [general] (ph) economy. We're still seeing the positive effects of a strong recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate, in fact, stands today at 3.9%. Folks, that's 2 full percentage points better than the national average.  As I mentioned, business continues to grow with new projects across the region. For example, Milwaukee Tool is expanding the operations again here in Milwaukee. If you're not familiar with Milwaukee Tool, the company has been a leader in the development of battery-powered cordless tools. It now has become the world's number one producer of tools for professionals in the construction trades, utility sector, as well as for auto mechanics.  And now, Milwaukee Tool is redeveloping a vacant downtown office tower to provide space for 1,200 new employees over the next 5 years. In addition, a number of other economic development projects are in the pipeline, and we'll be covering those with you in future calls. On that note, I'll turn our call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segments. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 4,000 more electric customers and 18,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet. Overall retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 7.1% from the second quarter of 2020. And on a weather-normal basis, were up 5.8%.  We are encouraged by the economic rebound we are seeing in our service territory. For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 10.4% from last year's Second Quarter, and on a weather-normal basis were up 9.2%. Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 14.8% from the second quarter of 2020. And on a weather-normal basis, were up 13.9%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were down 4.9%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%.  Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up. Turning now to our WEC Infrastructure segment. As Gale noted, we have agreed to acquire a 90% ownership interest in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center. The project is being developed in McLean County, Illinois by Invenergy. The site will consist of 64 wind turbines for a combined capacity of 250 megawatts. We expect it will go into service late in 2022. The projects -- project fits our investment criteria very well. We plan to invest $412 million with a 90% ownership interest.  We now have 8 wind projects announced or in operation in our Infrastructure segment. This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investment. We expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion in this segment over the remainder of our 5-year plan. Our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go into service by early next year and our Thunderhead Wind investment is now projected to go into service in the first half of 2022. These timelines have been factored into our forecast. In case you're wondering about the impact of inflation on these projects, to date, we have not encountered any significant inflationary pressure. Remember that we primarily invest in turnkey projects with developers. So, we are seeing no reduction of returns. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Scott. Touching on some recent developments in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow 1 Solar project is nearing completion and is producing test energy. As you may recall, we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin and Madison Gas and Electric owns the remaining 50 megawatts. This is our second large-scale solar project, and part of our plans for more than triple [Indiscernible] renewable energy between 2021 and 2025.  We expect the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, to achieve commercial operations next year. Now, for a few regulatory updates. Recall that after reaching an agreement with the major customer and environmental groups, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission to forego a rate base for our Wisconsin utilities this year. We expect a decision in the weeks to come. And we're pleased that the Commission has approved pilot programs for electric vehicle charging in our Wisconsin service areas.  For these programs, we plan to install charging equipment, and electric distribution infrastructure. This is the first step in our effort to promote affordable charging options for electric vehicles. And we also have an update on the rate reviews at two of our smaller utilities. In Illinois earlier this year, North Shore Gas requested a rate increase primarily due to the significant capital investments we have made since the last rate base in 2015. Recently, the administrative law judge on the case issued a proposed order.  The order recommends a $4.2 million rate increase on a 9.67% ROE and 51.6% equity component. We expect the commission's final decision by mid-September. Finally, in Michigan, I'm pleased to advise you that we have reached a settlement with all parties to conclude our rate review for Michigan Gas Utilities. This settlement stipulates a 9.85% return on equity and a revenue increase of $9.25 million with an equity layer of 51.5%. We expect the commission's approval by the end of the Third Quarter. We have no other rate cases pending at this time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Xia. Xia Liu : Thank you, Kevin. Our 2021 second quarter earnings of $0.87 cents per share increased $0.11 cents per share compared to the second quarter of 2020. Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations. Our regulated utilities benefited from warmer-than-normal weather, recovering economy, continued execution of our capital plan, and our focus on operating efficiency. The earnings package put on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter results on page 17.  I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our Earnings by $0.09 compared to the second quarter of 2020. First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic drove a $0.06 increase in earnings. This reflects stronger weather-normalized sales, as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges. Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Lower day-to-day O&M contributed one penny and all other factors resulted in a positive variance of $0.02.  These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense. I'd like to point out that quarter-over-quarter, the impact of weather was flat. Overall, we added $0.09 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2020. While we picked up a penny in the current quarter from continued capital investment, this was more than offset by a $0.03 benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2020, related to a FERC order.  Recall that this order allowed ATC to increase its ROE from 10.38% to 10.52%, retroactive to November 2013. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved one penny in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions, partially offset by less than projected wind resources. Finally, we saw a $0.03 improvement in the corporate and other segments. Lower interest expense contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter. We recognize a $0.03 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development.  These positive variances were partially offset by a reduction of $0.01 in rabbi trust performance and $0.01 in taxes and others. In summary, we improved on our second quarter of 2020 performance by $0.11. Now, I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021.  Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax positions with our current capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities decreased a $153 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first 6 months of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. Recall that despite the natural gas costs, seeing throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with higher accounts receivable balances, contributed to this increase in working capital. We were able to improve our working capital position in the second quarter.  With normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were at $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2021, a $93 million increase as compared with the first 6 months of 2020. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and energy infrastructure business.  On the financing front, we continue to find opportunities to lower our interest costs. In fact, in June, we refinanced $300 million of debt at Wisconsin Electric, reducing the average coupon of these notes by over 1.2% and extending the maturity to 2028. In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the third quarter. We are expecting a range of $0.72 to $0.74 per share for the third quarter.  This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. This also takes into account the timing of our fuel recovery and the costs associated with major storms that impacted our system last week. As a reminder, we earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter last year. This includes an estimated $0.05 of better than normal weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2021 Earnings guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.05 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. In addition to raising our annual guidance, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% a year with a strong bias toward the upper half of that range. And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As you may recall, in January, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 7.1% to C/67.75 a share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.  We're in the middle of that range now. So, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Overall ladies and gentlemen, we're on track, focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator instructions]. And we'll pause for just one moment to compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. James Schaefer : Hey, good afternoon guys. It's actually James for Shar. Sorry, Gale. Gale Klappa : Oh hey, how you doing? James Schaefer : Good, good. Thanks for taking my questions. Gale Klappa : Well, what have you done with Shar? James Schaefer : He's still in his bunker in New Jersey. Gale Klappa : There you go. Excellent. Okay. Great. James Schaefer : So, I guess just first on the policy side on Illinois, it sounds like negotiations on the comprehensive package hit an impasse recently. I realize it's not heavily focused on gas, but you guys are still involved. Do you guys have any updated thoughts on the prospects for something to get done in the coming weeks? Gale Klappa : Well, I think we always thought that getting something done reasonably quickly was a very long shot in Illinois. The one thing that I think stands out post the public discussion of the impasse between the parties is it both the Governor and the Senate majority leader have essentially urged the parties to continue talking. We'll see what happens. But again, very little impact on gas distribution companies in Illinois. This is a major focus if you -- as you know, particularly on Exelon and on nuclear power plants. Pass or not, agreement or not, there's really no material impact on our company, on Peoples Gas or North Shore Gas in Illinois. James Schaefer : Gotcha. Thanks. Gale Klappa : Thanks. James Schaefer : A little closer to home on the Wisconsin side. WPL's recent settlement had an interesting proposal for the recovery on their retiring Edgewater plan. Have you guys gotten a chance to dig into that, and could that be a template for the balance of the non power the future fleet, which I think it's just [Indiscernible] and Columbia at this point? Gale Klappa : Well, we're very aware of the approach that Alliant took, and could it be a template for going forward? It certainly could be. It's an interesting approach. I think it's a balanced approach. And certainly, something we'll be taking a look at. As you know, we're planning to retire the older units at our Oak Creek site.  Units 5, 6, 7, and 8. 1960s vintage units, we're planning to retire those. We've announced the retirements in 2023 and 2024. We have plenty of time to continue to work with all the parties involved. But yes, it was a very interesting approach to a settlement and one that really could make a lot of sense going forward. James Schaefer : Got it. That's all I had. Thanks, and congrats on the results and the championship. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Appreciate it very much. Tell Shar to behave, okay? James Schaefer : Will do. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Gale Klappa : Greetings Julien. Julien Smith : Hey, hey, how are you? Gale Klappa : We're good. How about you? Julien Smith : Congrats with -- quite well. Thank you. Congrats on the recent win here. It must be exciting. Gale Klappa : Yeah, terrific. It's been great -- it's been great for the city, even great for the region. So happy for the team. And happy for you. I understand that you proposed during Game 6; is that true? Julien Smith : [So off of the] (ph) heading, right? No. Recently, the -- that I can confirm that. It's been exciting. Thank you. Maybe to cut to other exciting news here you guys, if I look at '21 guidance relative to where you are year-to-date here, you're ahead $0.30.  How are you thinking about O&M in the back half of this year? I know you guys like to push and pull O&M to ensure a linear trajectory here. But as you think about the relatively conservative nature of your guidance, can you comment a little bit on where you stand on the back half this year? Gale Klappa : Sure. We have a number of maintenance projects planned for the back half of the year. And also, as Sean mentioned, we have some 6 million, 7 million of reasonably extraordinary costs just last week for repair from serious storms that took out over 100,000 customers in Northern Wisconsin and had 6 tornadoes in a line between the Western Milwaukee suburbs and Madison. We had some extraordinary costs in July, which influenced the range of guidance that Xia gave you for the third quarter. But again, there are numerous projects that we have lined up for the fourth quarter for O&M. I still believe that we will -- our day-to-day O&M will be down for the year. But we certainly have an opportunity to really carry out some very, very good maintenance that will help us for 2022. Julien Smith : Right. Excellent. And perhaps just to parse that statement a little bit. You still leave it to be down, but your previous expectation is 2% to 3%? Gale Klappa : That was our previous expectation, and certainly a goal we could hit. But as we look at some of the extraordinary storm costs and other work, again, we believe it will be down. It may not be down 2% to 3%, but that doesn't mean that the trajectory is still long-term, not in place. It still is. It's just a matter of looking at a 6-month period if you will. Julien Smith : Got it. Excellent. And lastly, can I just [ask] (ph), obviously, you're pretty excited about sales, some of the leading indicators of what sales might do. Can you comment a little bit preliminarily on how you're thinking about trends in the '22 even? I mean, obviously '21 retail sales coming in 1% below '19 on the normalized basis and sets up pretty nicely here as you think about it. But I'd be curious on how you would characterize some of these larger projects, et cetera, coming in. Gale Klappa : Many of the larger projects that we've been referring to, the larger economic development projects, are now under construction. We wouldn't necessarily expect a big uptick in 2022 from those projects, although there will be some. But really, it's 2023 and 2024, and beyond, where we'll see the big impact from some of the economic development projects. But I would say as we look at the landscape, again, you go back to the tailwind of the economic recovery in Wisconsin, which has been very strong. Scott detailed the big uptick in large commercial and industrial demand. And Scott, I think one of the more encouraging things to me on the natural gas side of the business is we continue to see very strong customer growth. Scott Lauber : Yeah, that's exactly correct, Gale. We're seeing good customer growth, specifically on the gas side. But on the electric side too, we're hooking up a lot of new services on both gas and electric in Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota on the gas side also, so good growth. And the small commercial industrial really did well this quarter. But remember, it was compared to the first quarter of the pandemic last year, but very happy where the sales are right now. Gale Klappa : I do think we have to see how the variant continues to spread. Many companies were planning on a significant return to the office, if you will, in September. We and others have now pushed that off till October at the earliest. So that could have some short-term impact, but overall, as Scott said, we feel very, very positive about our projections for demand growth for both gas and electricity. Julien Smith : Excellent, alright well thank you very much. Take care, see you soon. Gale Klappa : You too. Thank you, Julien. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Gale Klappa : Hey, Durgesh. How are you today? Durgesh Chopra : Hey, Gale. Congrats on both front, sports and a great quarter. Just two questions from me. First, for Xia. On the $0.03 gain on Clean Energy Fund, could you elaborate on what that is? Xia Liu : Sure. We have a very small investment in a fund that invest in development stage companies in the renewable energy space and charging infrastructure space. It's very small -- I think the balance is only $30 million, but we're happy to see the gain. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. Thanks. I didn't realize you actually have that investment. Okay. Just -- and then maybe just quickly, Gale, sorry if I missed this, but any update on the Wisconsin rate case proceeding? Your sort of petition to delay the rate case. You haven't heard back from the commission yet, right? Gale Klappa : Yes, we have now seen publicly the Commission staff memo on the subject, and usually the Commission will vote -- post them -- publication of the staff memo on it -- on any matter like this, within a matter of weeks. So, I would expect within just a matter of weeks, we will have a committee vote on the stay-out proposal. And again, the -- overall the staff memo was just fine. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. Congrats again here on back-to-back execution for many years and again this quarter. Thanks. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Durgesh. Appreciate it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Greetings and congratulations, Gale, and then the City of Milwaukee on the NBA title. That's -- I wish my Grizzlies would pull off something like that, rooting for them. Got a question for you. When I look at your capital budget, your 5-year, and I know you're only a couple of months away from providing investors with an update to that. Year 4 and year 5 are down from years 1, 2, 3. If that actually happens, it means you become a free cash flow generating company.  But if you had to be a wagering man at this earlier stage, and I know year 4 and year 5 is an eternity away. Do you think that actually happens? And if not, what are the things -- what are the buckets that could make year 4 and year 5 or maybe even years 3 through 5 a good bit higher than what you outlined last November for your 5-year outlook? Gale Klappa : Great question, Michael. First of all, if you look historically at our 5-year capital plan, years 4 and 5 always tail off a bit. It is just kind of how we roll. And the reason for that is, we don't like to have a lot of white spaces and a lot of undefined line items in our 5-year capital plan. So, we tend to give you, particularly for the first 3 years, stuff that we know is actually going to be proposed, is actually going to build upon approval, et cetera.  But historically, I think for all the years I have been here when we've laid out our 5-year capital plan you've always seen a bit of a downturn compared to the first 3 years for years 4 and 5.  So, to directly answer your question, I do not believe when we update our 5-year capital plan, which we'll do on our next analyst call in early November, Beth, I believe? And then, with much more details of the [Indiscernible] finance conference. You're not going to see -- I would be stunned if you saw any kind of a decline in what is now years 4 and 5. It's just not going to happen. Not going to happen in particular because of the strong investment opportunity that we have in front of us.  And what kind of buckets might we see? Well, clearly, there's going to be an additional emphasis on continuing to invest in renewables and battery storage, distribution upgrades, new customer connections, you name it. It'll be across the board, but as you know, a very significant tailwind as we continue to execute our ESG progress plan, continue to reach those lofty environmental goals, those aggressive environmental goals. Again, I wouldn't put too much stock in looking at years 4 and 5 right now. Those buckets will definitely be filled up. Scott, anything to add to that? Scott Lauber : I think you're exactly right, Gale. We've always had a tendency to be a little bit lower on those other years. And as Kevin mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're just seeing the start of the electric vehicle pilot we have. So, we already got some interest in that, and then we don't even have the order yet. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities ahead on the generation and the distribution side. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one follow-up. Gale, you made a comment about inflation. What are you all seeing in terms of cost in -- commodity cost input for things like gas distribution mains, or equipment -- other equipment; things like copper, et cetera? And even on the regulated side of the business -- a larger side of the business and what that does to your CapEx projections? Gale Klappa : Well, at the present time -- you looked at copper, for example, it was elevated 4, 5, 6 months ago and haven't -- haven't moved much since, for example. We're really frankly not seeing a ton of -- I think as we phrased it, really not a -- no significant impact so far. Now, part of that is because of the way we deal with our infrastructure segment and the fact that we have set prices with developers that have a very long history of being able to procure a very positive and constructive price.  So, on the infrastructure side, we haven't really seen any significant impact at all. On the regulated side, again, a lot of the projects that we have underway, procurement has already taken place. So not much at this stage of the game in terms of inflationary impact. Where we have seen some inflationary impact is actually in the natural gas commodity prices. We were up over $4 per million BTU just the other day.  So, there I think, with the glut of natural gas a bit disappearing across the country, I think we're going to see some elevated natural gas prices, certainly for winter -- the upcoming winter, but that's were, in my opinion, we're seeing the first kind of signs. And then in terms of the future, it's anybody's guess how sticky the inflation numbers are. But one of the things that I always tend to look at for what it's worth. Remember Milton Friedman said that inflation is, has been, and always will be a monetary phenomenon.  One of the things I think that we look at is essentially the growth of the money supply. And if you look at the growth of the money supply, it's already begun to taper off a little bit. It's still up, and up materially, but it's already begun to taper off a little bit. That gives me some hope that while we probably for the next year we'll see some elevated inflation numbers. Perhaps it's on its way to a more normal level. Michael Lapides : Got it. And hey, one last question, and this is just a modeling one. Can you remind me -- you mentioned, in the prepared remarks, the in-service dates for Thunderhead and Jayhawk? Gale Klappa : Yup. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. Thunderhead is going to be in the first half of next year. And then Jayhawk should be probably in the first quarter. Michael Lapides : Got it. So, both of those -- both of those moved a little from original in-service dates? Gale Klappa : Well, Jayhawk, maybe a month or two, no big deal. Thunderhead we ran into a problem with something called the American burying beetle, which has now been removed as I understand it from the endangered species list. Actually, the construction on Thunderhead is about done. It's a matter of the substation completing construction now that all of that has been worked through in terms of moving forward post the issue with the American burying beetle. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Gale Klappa : Right. You\u2019re welcome, Michael. Thank you for your questions. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Gale Klappa : Hello, Jeremy. How are you today? Jeremy Tonet : Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. Gale Klappa : It's been nice being here. Now, go right ahead. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to touch base on -- with the way, there's wind announcement here, it seems that about half of the planned infrastructure investments are now identified. Is there any timing or tax considerations limiting a continued acceleration here? And just how do you see the market backdrop amid broader infrastructure discussions in DC here? Gale Klappa : Well, the truth of the matter is, we have timed the size if you will, and the timing of our infrastructure segment investments over the 5-year period to match our tax position and the ability to monetize production tax credits. There's nothing though that would stand in the way of some modest additional acceleration of the investments. You're right, we are ahead of schedule with very high-quality projects.  Going forward, I know there's been a lot of discussion around the industry about lower returns, backlogs, and delays. But I would say, if you look at our pipeline of potential projects, it is still very robust. And we're working with potential projects and developers that have long successful track records. We don't see right now any diminution of the kind of projects that we're interested in for our infrastructure segment.  Or, and more importantly, we're not seeing any -- excuse me -- any significant diminution in returns. In fact, we mentioned, both Scott and I, that Sapphire Sky -- that has the potential to be one of the very best return projects we've ever had. So again, for us -- excuse me -- and for the segment, we're looking at, and for the highest quality projects with great developers, we feel very, very positive about our pipeline. I hope that responds to your question. Jeremy Tonet : That was very helpful. Thank you for that. Maybe just shifting gears a bit here, and given the elevated market attention on coal generation. And when you think about power, the future coal here, just wondering if you could update us on how you balance local reliability needs with this backdrop and maybe the potential to repower the asset with natural gas. And how near-term could this potentially be if you decide to go in that direction? Gale Klappa : Well, great question. I'm going to ask Scott to give you his view on this as well. Let me just say two quick things. Essentially, with the retirement of all the core 5 units, that has already taken place on our system. If we announced retirements that we've talked about already, really, there's very little coal-fired capacity left in our system after 2025. You and others were asked about the new units at our Oak Creek site.  Those new units are very efficient -- among the most efficient thermal part and power plants in the world. And I should remind everybody that what we need to do, in looking at the future of those units, is to separate the value of those units from the fuel source. And let me explain that. The new Oak Creek units are ideally situated on the transmission grid in the Midwest. They are very important to reliability in the Middle Western part of the United States, not just Wisconsin. So, we built those units and remember the first unit came online in 2010, the second in 2011. We built those units with some flexibility. In fact, there is natural gas on the site. It is possible, and we've done it several times, to co-fire the units on coal and natural gas. And yes, it is possible -- technically possible for the units to be converted away from coal to natural gas at some point. In fact, we are taking a look at both from an engineering standpoint and a cost standpoint, the feasibility of doing so. Scott, what would you like to add to that? Scott Lauber : No, that's the exact right tail. And when you think about the reliability, as you brought up the reliability of the system, and when we look at it and when we talk about 8% of energy from coal in 2030, that still gives a potential for about 17%, 18% of capacity as needed on that really, really peak day to make sure we have the energy that's needed. And Gale, that is exactly right. We can look at potential convergence there in the future. We really have to look at how do we keep the reliability and affordability and clean energy in the system? Gale Klappa : And one other point, our goal for 2030 of 80% reductions in carbon does not assume any conversion of the new Oak Creek units away from coal to natural gas. So that just gives you a sense of how effective we can be in continuing to reduce CO2 even with very efficient coal-fired units at the new Oak Creek site still in place. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Sounds like nice optionality going forward there. Gale Klappa : And I think that's a great way to describe it. We have a lot of options with a very key asset again to reliability for the region. Jeremy Tonet : Great, thanks. And just one last one if I could sneak it in here. Thanks for the update on the Wisconsin rate case process there. Just wondering, are you focused on any other regulatory items locally in advance of filing next year? Gale Klappa : No, it's pretty calm. I mean, it really is. And Kevin described the ALJ proposed order at North Shore Gas, one of our smallest Companies in Illinois, just agreed to a settlement of a rate case in Michigan for Michigan Gas Utilities. But other than that, and the normal course filings, it's pretty steady as she goes. Scott Lauber : Yeah. The Commission will continue to look at the solar projects we have on the solar and battery projects so we can get approval on those and start implementing that. Gale Klappa : Yeah, that's a good point. We've made several multiple filings if you will, over the course of the first half of this year, to move forward with at 1,800 megawatts of wind and solar and battery storage regulated for Wisconsin. That's going well. Jeremy Tonet : Great. Thank you. Kindly, I'll leave it there. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Jeremy. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Market. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Sophie. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually signed details for Sophie. Thanks for taking my question, though. Gale Klappa : Sure. Unidentified Analyst : About the Oak Creek and Columbia units that you plan to reach higher, can you tell us if they're part of the regulated utility on the unregulated part? Gale Klappa : No, that -- those are all part of our regulated asset base in Wisconsin. Unidentified Analyst : And does it -- as you look retiring more in the future, does it make a difference which one you decide to retire first? I'm just trying to get a sense of what factors is go into consideration as you seek units for retirement. Gale Klappa : Well, that's really a very simple answer, and that is, as we look to retire additional capacity, we look first and foremost at older units that are less efficient. So, it's all driven by age and efficiency, what kind of capital it might take to keep those units alive.  It's really not a complicated formula. We look at age, efficiency, and whether or not it makes any sense from a capital investment standpoint to spend the dollars that would keep those units alive. And of course, as I mentioned, the next units to be retired on our system would be the older Oak Creek units.  They've been part of the Wisconsin retail rate base since the 1960s. That's units 5, 6, 7, and 8 at our older Oak Creek site. And then, we're a joint owner with Alliant for the Columbia Units 1 and 2. Scott, those would retire in the same timeframe, correct? Scott Lauber : Correct, '23 and '24. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotia bank. Gale Klappa : Hello, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : : Hi, good afternoon. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon. Andrew Weisel : : It seems like so many others you've been facing a growing number of extreme weather events. You've been fortunate and well-positioned to react quickly so it hasn't been devastating in terms of outages. But as you evaluate your O&M programs, do you see an opportunity or a need to change anything as far as storm preparation and response? Gale Klappa : Well, the short answer is, we continue to invest in reliability. And I'm very proud of our folks, very proud of the fact that We Energies has been named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for 10 consecutive years running. We have -- we have a historic and positive investment program that we continue with to ensure upgrades and reliability.  Not only just from the standpoint of undergrounding some lines as we've done in Northern Wisconsin, but proactive replacement of transformers where we know there's a failure rate, postage 50. There's a lot going on in terms of, again, positive investment opportunities to maintain superior reliability. I would just say though, Andrew, I'm not sure we're seeing more extraordinary weather events than we have in the past. In fact, in the last couple of years, the tornado season in Wisconsin has been milder than in some previous years. We have seen two or three polar vortex events. But if you look back over the course of the last 40 or 50 years, candidly, and Scott -- we've both been around Wisconsin a long time in the Midwest. I don't think we're seeing a dramatic change in weather events, do you? Scott Lauber : No. I -- we were having extreme polar vortex years ago. We just didn't have the fancy name polar vortex; it was just cold. But I think you're just seeing more strain on the system across the enterprise or across the country. As -- like we saw in Texas and a variety -- I think are getting a lot more media time too. Gale Klappa : And to Scott 's point, there's a lesson here from what we're seeing around the country. And it's a lesson that I think all of us who have been around for a while truly believe in, and that is when you have to have it for reliability when lives are on the line when it's -42 without the windshield in Northern Wisconsin, diversity of fuel mix and dispatchability really make a difference.  And that's something we can't forget as an industry or as a Company. Reliability is the bedrock of what we do. Millions of lives were saved by the availability of natural gas this past winter in the northern part of the U.S. We're very cognizant of how important reliability is, and we'll continue to invest to maintain superior reliability. Andrew Weisel : : Got it. Thank you, everyone. Gale Klappa : You are welcome, Weisel. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with Hudson Bay Capital. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll, Vedula. Long time no talk to. Vedula Murti : Sorry, can you hear me? Gale Klappa : We can hear you. How are you doing, Vedula? Vedula Murti : I'm doing well. Thank you. Supposing one touched a little bit on the lesson for your quarter. Just not sure but I guess what I'm more direction in is how you manage to fix the price [Indiscernible] to preserve market capacity prices given a vehicle with technology [Indiscernible] how it begins kind of what we've been seeing and reading about it [Indiscernible] we need to have variability on -- during these periods and just then.  And there are also people. And people have more -- but people in the homes, their ability to be able to talk about one ton of [Indiscernible] call in [Indiscernible] success in Canada for the rate at which you would have to buy us from other parties [Indiscernible] Gale Klappa : Vedula, I'm very sorry. You broke up several times. I'm not sure that I understood the gist of your question. Beth was a little bit closer to -- Beth, can you tell me what you think Vedula was asking? M. Beth Straka : I only caught a portion of it related to EVs and the growth of EVs. Gale Klappa : Okay. All right. Well, we can certainly -- and Vedula if you want to try it again. Again, you broke up a few times and I apologize. We couldn't quite follow you. Vedula Murti : Oh, well where I was going -- I'm having problems with my phone as well. [Indiscernible] Gale Klappa : Okay. Well, we can talk a bit about the growth of EVs. Again, we're very pleased. There will be, I think, a number of policy initiatives, both at the federal level, as you know, but also at the state level here in Wisconsin to try to encourage the penetration and customer ownership of EVs. And I see that as another investment opportunity for us.  As Kevin mentioned, we just had approved a pilot program that will allow us to offer cost-effective charging options for a range of customers, including some nonprofit customers, including government entities, et cetera, et cetera. So, we're on it in terms of trying to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. And we'll see how this goes, but already, again, as Scott mentioned, we don't even have a final order written yet, and we have a number of interested parties, and we're already beginning substantive talks with folks on our EV pilot charging program. I hope, Vedula, that answers your question. Vedula Murti : All right. I'll go offline. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Okay. Terrific. Thank you Vedula. All right. Well, I think that covers the waterfront for today, folks. That concludes our conference call for this afternoon. Thank you so much for taking part. If you have more questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka. And she can be reached at 414-221-4539. Thank you, everybody. Take care. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissions could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be made available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : From Americas heartland, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we review our results for Third Quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO, Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer, Xia Liu our Chief Financial Officer and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I'm sure you saw the announcement last week that our Board of Directors has taken the next step in our long-term succession planning. Kevin has decided to devote more time to his grandchildren and water skiing barefoot on his favorite lakes. He'll be retiring in 2022. We're delighted that Scott will assume the role of President and Chief Executive on February 1. And finally, I've agreed to continue serving as Executive Chairman until our annual stockholders meeting in 2024. Kevin and Scott, of course, have been instrumental in shaping our progress over many years. We wish Kevin all the best, and I look forward to working hand-in-hand with Scott as he takes on his new role. Now, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $0.92 a share. Our results were significantly better than expected, driven by warmer than normal weather, continued economic recovery in our region and our focus on operating efficiency. Our Balance Sheet, our cash flows remains strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. In just a moment, we will update you on the details of our new 5 year ESG progress plan, a plan that will cover our investments in reliability and decarbonization over the period 2022 through 2026. As we've reported to you, we're well on our way to achieving some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. Across our generation fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction by 2025 and an 80% reduction by 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Importantly, we have a roadmap to reach these goals without any major advances in technology. So today, we're announcing that our use of coal will continue to decline to a level that we expect will be immaterial by the end of 2030. By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal will account for less than 5% of the power we supply to customers. The number of you have also been asking, when can we exit coal completely? Here's the answer. We believe we will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the year 2035. The next logical question is what does this mean for the modern coal-fired units at our Oak Creek site? As you recall, these units were part of our power of the future plan and were completed only about a decade ago. While our modern units at Oak Creek will remain a key part of our fleet for many, many years to come. These power the future units rank as some of the most efficient in the country, among the top 5% of all coal-fired plants in heat rate performance over the past decade. And they're strategically as we've discussed, they are strategically located to support reliability on the Midwestern transmission grid. Fortunately, we can plan for the future of the new units at Oak Creek with fuel flexibility in mind. We've tested co-firing on natural gas at the site. So subject to the receipt of an environmental permit, we plan to make operating refinements over the next 2 years that will allow a fuel blend of up to 30% on natural gas. And then over time, we will be able to transition completely away from coal by making incremental investments in plant equipment. This would include, for example, new burners. And of course. We will need additional pipeline capacity reaching into the site. So we see a very bright and long future for the newer units at Oak Creek. And now let's take a look at the capital plan that we'll continue to shape a de -carbonizing economy. For the period 2022 through 2026, we expect to invest $17.7 billion. Our focus remains on efficiency, sustainability, and growth. This ESG progress plan is the largest capital plan on our history. An increase of $1.6 billion or nearly 10% above our previous 5-year plan. We expect this plan to support compound earnings growth of 6% to 7% a year over the next 5 years without any need to issue new equity. Will be increasing our investment in renewables for our regulated utilities from 1800 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 2400 megawatts in this brand new plan. These carbon-free assets includes solar, wind, and battery storage. We're also dedicating more capital to hardening our electric distribution networks so that we can maintain a superior level of reliability for our customers. And investments in our gas delivery systems, and the development of renewable natural gas will support our goals for the gas distribution business as well. As a reminder, we are targeting net 0 methane emissions by 2030. To add it all up, and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan, the projects that are driving our growth are low-risk and highly executable, and they're accelerating the transition to a clean energy future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and 15,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric, and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.4% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis, were up 2.5%. We continue to see economic rebound in our service territory. For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 3.5% from last year's third quarter, and on a weather-normal basis, they were up 4.2%. Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 3.8% from the third quarter of 2020, and on a weather-normal basis, were up 3.5%. Natural gas delivery in Wisconsin were up 1%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%. Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast, as the economy continues to open up. Turning now to our infrastructure segment, our new capital plan calls for the investment of $1.9 billion between 2022 and 2026. Considering the 3 projects that are currently under development, we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion at that time frame. As a quick reminder, we have 8 wind projects, all with long-term off-takers. Announced or in operation are our infrastructure segment. This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investments. As previously discussed, our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year, and our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service in the first half of 2022. These timelines have been factored into our updated capital plan. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin for an update on our Utility Operations. Kevin Fletcher : Thank you, Scott. First I'll cover some developments here in Wisconsin. I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow 1 Solar project is just weeks away from completion. You'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin. For the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow 2, we now are performing civil work and grading. Our target for completing that project is the end of 2022. That date will depend on module supply, which is uncertain as we await clarity on matters before the Department of Commerce. Now, for a few regulatory updates, we expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission shortly on our plans to build two liquefied natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. This proposed investment would greatly enhanced customer savings and reliability during Wisconsin 's cold winters. Pending approval, we expect the facilities to enter service in late 2023. They are projected to save our WEC Energy's customers approximately $200 million over time. We also have updates on the rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. The Illinois Commerce Commission unanimously approved the final order for our rate case at North Shore Gas. The order authorizes a rate increase of 4.5%, including an ROE of 9.67% and an equity ratio of 51.58%. New rates went into effect on September the 15th. And the Michigan Public Service Commission unanimously approved a settlement in our rate case for Michigan Gas Utilities. The settlement authorizes a rate increase of 6.35%, including an ROE of 9.85% and an equity ratio of 51.5%. New rates will be effective January the 1st. We have no other rate cases pending at this time. And as we look forward to the winter heating season ahead, I'm pleased to report that we are ready. We have our gas contracts in place, and our gas inventories are at our targeted levels. And with that, I'll turn it over to Xia. Xia Liu : Thanks, Kevin. We continue to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Our 2021 third quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020. Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earning from our utility operations. Our regulated utilities benefited from the strong Economic recovery in our region. continued execution of our capital plan, and our focus on operating efficiency. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning, includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2020. First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic and stronger weather-normalized sales drove a $0.03 increase in earnings. Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the third quarter of 2020 and lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.04. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher Depreciation and Amortization expense and $0.02 of increased fuel costs related to higher natural gas prices. It's worth noting that we estimate whether was $0.05 favorable compared to normal in the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020. Overall, we added $0.05 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. Earnings increased $0.01 compared to the third quarter of 2020, driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. This was driven by production tax credit related to wind farm acquisitions. Finally, we saw a $0.01 improvement in the corporate and other segment. This increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense. In summary, we improved on our third quarter of 2020 performance by $0.08 a share. Now, I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest tax payer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $57 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first 9 months of 2021, more than offset the higher working capital requirements. As expected, with normal collection practices underway in all of our service territories, we made great strides in improving our working capital position in the third quarter. Total Capital expenditures and Asset Acquisitions were $1.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021, a $129 million increase as compared with the first 9 months of 2020. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utilities and energy infrastructure business. Looking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plans to invest $17.7 billion over the next 5 years in key infrastructure. This ESG progress plan supports 7% annual growth in our asset-base. Pages 18 and 19 of the earnings package provide more details of the breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here. As we continue to make our energy transition, nearly 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $5.4 billion in renewable investments and $6.8 billion in grid and fleet's reliability. Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to support our strong customer growth. We also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and a modernization of our infrastructure to further generate long-term operating efficiency. With our strong economic development background and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability, and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead. Even beyond the next 5 years. In closing, before I turn it back to Gail, I'd like to provide our guidance. We're raising our earnings guidance again for 2021 to a range of $4.05 to $4.07 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. This is the second time we're raising our guidance. If you will recall, our original guidance was $3.99 to $4.03 per share. With that, I will turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. We're on track for a solid year, again, in light of our strong performance, our guidance range now stands at $4.05 to $4.07 per share. We're also tightening our projection of long-term earnings growth to a range of 6% to 7% per year. And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As usual, I expect our board will assess our dividend plans for next year at our scheduled meeting in early December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now so I expect our Dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our Earnings per Share. Overall, we're on track, focus on delivering and providing value for our customers and our stockholders. And Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Now we will take your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. If you're using a speakerphone, turn off your mute button -- mute function to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll, Shar. How are you doing? Shar Pourreza : Not too bad. Not too bad, Gale. Appreciate it. So just a couple of questions and Gale, when I unpacked your comments around the Oak Creek Power of The Future units because I think that's somewhat pretty material. Any estimate around capital cost to fully convert from coal to gas and what the heat rate of those units would be. I know the contracts are obviously tech -agnostic, but would shifting also base load units to essentially higher heat rate speakers have any kind of ramifications under the terms of the contracts with the unit service capacity or do you expect to run them all the time? Thanks. Gale Klappa : Great question, Shar. And I'm going to ask Scott to give you some details as well. Let me say one thing though. I would not expect as we move through the transition at the new Oak Creek units between now and 2035. I would not expect them to run simply as speakers. They're probably going to run much more like our Port Washington units, which are highly efficient combined cycle units. So I wouldn't make the conclusion of they will run as speakers, they're very much going to be needed for reliability. No question about that. In terms of capital, I mentioned that the incremental capital Investments in the plant, and [Indiscernible] have Scott give you the details. I can tell you though that after a lot of work and a lot of analysis, we still have more to do for the long run. But after a lot of work and a lot of analysis, we are convinced that this is an economic thing to do for customers. Scott. Scott Lauber : Sure, Gale. In retro view, look at the plant in this first step here to get to that 30%, we're looking at a very modest investment, approximately $30 million to get it to be able to run at that blend -- co-blending with some gas and a little coal. And then as you look farther out in that 2030 timeframe, 2035 timeframe, as we look at converting completely, that would be approximately a $150 million, but this is really early in that analysis and more to come as we continue to flush that out. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Thank you for that. And then just -- Gale just the $1.6 billion increase in the Capital plan is -- obviously you highlighted it's really material. It's driven by electric, maybe at the expense of energy infrastructure and gas spend, right? So as you're kind of looking on the roll-forward, electric spend is up about $2 billion and the infrastructure and gas are down around $450. Is this the broader and more sustainable strategic shift in growth focus going forward, or just a timing factor, especially as we're thinking about your plans beyond 25. Gale Klappa : Again, a great question Shar. Let me just say this. We always start with need and our preference, obviously, is to invest in regulated assets where there is clearly a customer benefit or a customer need. So as we look at this plan, and you're right, the increases material, but as we look at this plan compared to the prior 5-year plan, and again, largest 5-year capital plan in our history at $17.7 billion. The 2 things you mentioned are correct. First of all, we will be adding a significant amount of renewables to maintain reliability as we retire older, less efficient coal-fired plants in this time frame. So the first is we have got to replace some of that capacity with carbon-free energy. So there's an increase in renewable investment -- regulated renewable investment in the plan compared to the previous 5-year plan. And then -- and this is something that we've all talked about internally and Kevin continues to point out, and he's absolutely right, we have aging distribution infrastructure. And that aging distribution infrastructure, which we've invested in, in the past. We're coming up to a period now, where there is a much greater need to replace that aging distribution infrastructure. So those are the two drivers, if you will, of the incremental change in this 5-year Capital plan versus the prior 5-year Capital plan. Does that respond to your question? Shar Pourreza : It does, and that's super helpful, Gale. And then just lastly is just on the infrastructure segment. On that roll-forward, does the contracting spending profile -- is it indicating anything something about [Indiscernible] project returns you're seeing or pressure from input costs, or is it just really a function of limited capital flowing to newer regulated opportunities instead? So are you seeing any of these pressures in the business that others are seeing? Gale Klappa : No. And again, we've been asked this question, as you know, before. The last one we just announced a few months ago, Sapphire Sky. Actually, our projections show having the best returns of any of the 8 projects. So we're not seeing a diminution at all in terms of potential returns or in terms of the robust nature of the pipeline. And remember, we've got 2 coming that have been announced but are not yet in service. Jayhawk and Upstream -- not Upstream. I'm sorry, Thunderhead. My James Bond Project, Thunderhead. And then in addition to that, there is still more than a $1 billion to be invested in this 5-year capital plan. So we're still very, very active and seeing the kind of positive returns that we would expect to see. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic. Thank you for that and congrats Scott and Kevin on phase two, and Gale, don't go anywhere. You're still too young. [Indiscernible] It's appreciated. Gale Klappa : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishmann with Wolfe Research. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Steve, how are you doing? Steve Fleishmann : Hey, Gale, good afternoon. Hi, everyone. First of all, just on the new growth rate, the 6% to 7%, should we assume that that is based off of the initial 2021 guidance? Gale Klappa : Yes. Yes. Steve Fleishmann : Okay. I just wanted to know. Gale Klappa : I'm glad you asked. The short answer is yes. And then just to kind of put some numbers around it. Historically, what we've done is looked at the midpoint of our original guidance and then give you guidance, in this case, the 6% to 7% off of that. So the midpoint of our original guidance for 2021 is like $4.01 a share. Steve Fleishmann : Okay. Great. And then on the -- I know the spending to convert the newer Oak Creek units as relatively modest, but would that spending be recoverable under the lease structure of that law or would it be done more normal rate base. How would that work? Gale Klappa : Now, the short answer Steve is, that we obviously have to get commission approval for any investment of that kind, but it would be under the way the lease works, it would be under the Power the Future terms. Steve Fleishmann : Okay. And is that -- is there any chance that that could get extended if you do things to extend the period or those just have under the law said end dates. Gale Klappa : There's a current 30-year end date from the date of operation of the new Oak Creek units for the lease. So the Commission initially set a 30-year lease period, but in the terms of the agreement with the commission, The commission has the right to extend the lease. So all of that will be -- all of that will be dealt with probably around 23 9 2040, and I know that you are still going to be doing your -- Steve Fleishmann : You're not going to be the Chairman, then. And you'll still be Chairman. Last question, and this is a broad one. I'd be curious your take on the, I guess it's the Build Back Better Infrastructure Bill and potential implications and opportunities for WEC from that and chances you think a passing. Gale Klappa : It's such a sausage-making machine in Washington as you know but if I were a betting man, I think something will pass. And it appears as you've seen, Steve, that there is strong support for the renewable tax credit portion of that Build Back Better plan. And that seems to have stuck in every single version or every single iteration of the plan. So again, if I were embedding man, I would say that extensions of renewable tax credits will happen. And it looks like there's a strong possibility that what they call Direct Pay will occur. Now, if Direct Pay is a part of the renewable package, if you will, in that plan, then that clearly enhances our opportunities. It's good for customers, it's good for Cash Flows. It's good for the growth of our regulated business. It's good for the growth of our infrastructure segment. So I think a key to watch is not only the 10-year extension that they're talking about of production tax credits, also the flexibility on tax credits for solar, but also a big key would be the direct pay. And that would be a strong positive, and would also have a step back and look again at what is doable and what's needed here. Steve Fleishmann : Great. Thanks so much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome, Steve. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Julien Smith : Hey, good afternoon team. Thanks for the time. Congratulations. Gale Klappa : You're on the road again, Julien? Julien Smith : Trying to stay out of that, call it what it is. I appreciate it. And congratulations again to Kevin and Scott here. If I can pick it up where perhaps [Indiscernible] left it off on the Julien Smith : coal side. What about Weston here? You made the broader comment, not just about [Indiscernible], but about the wider nature of coal within your portfolio. Can you comment on that asset? And I have a follow-up. Gale Klappa : Sure. I'm going to give you an answer and then I'm going to let Shar and Scott give you a little bit more detail. But the Western units, which for those of you who may not be familiar, the Western units are relatively new coal-fired units that are an integral part of Wisconsin Public Service Generation Fleet, the Company that we acquired based in Green Bay. Western is a real workhorse. And again, we may have some flexibility there that we're looking at now in terms of optionality for the Western units. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes, Gale. At the Western and particularly the newer units, less than 4, we have actually done some coal firing on that with some natural gas also. So we'll be evaluating that as an option as we go through the next several years here. But we do realize that it's a very critical part of the state and we want to make sure we have the reliability at that location. We're going to continue to evaluate it. Gale Klappa : And Julien, to your question, which is a good one, and everyone should know, we have a path here to have a really significant change in our portfolio to support decarbonization and to get to aggressive environmental goals. We can do that, and we can do that without sacrificing reliability. We will not sacrifice reliability. We don't have to do that as we work through our plan. Julien Smith : Excellent. Thank you for clarifying that. If I can ask just on the infrastructure side, just elaborate on this. You said a moment ago your Sapphire project, for instance, is amongst the best returns you had thus far in your efforts. And obviously you're relatively scaling this down. Is this more about keeping the infrastructure segment within, call it a 10% bucket of total earnings, and having effectively achieved that with this 5-year outlook, and that's what's driving a little bit of scaling back? Or conversely, is this just about being conservative and arguably whether it's Direct Pay or whether it's just simply finding opportunities that exceed that allocation that you could actually be, again, sort of exceeding these budgets? Gale Klappa : Well, let me just say this. We're usually conservative and that won't surprise you. And I would look at what we've just laid out here for that segment of our capital spending over the next 5 years as a really strong placeholder, which we will then once we see what's in that build back better plan. We'll step back and see what opportunities it might give us. So I think the short answer to your question, and Xia is smiling and nodding her head. I think the short answer to your question is, we're being appropriately conservative today. Julien Smith : Excellent. Sorry. Just clarifying the earlier comment on [Indiscernible] what's the FFO-to-debt improvements in [Indiscernible], if you can quantify that at all? Gale Klappa : I'm sorry, you broke up Julien and can you ask that one more time. Julien Smith : Sorry the Balance Sheet -- under the plant today, how much better would your credit metrics get. As if you have any sense on that, obviously there's a lot of assumptions. Gale Klappa : Xia? Xia Liu : Julien, we're looking at the details as you know, that we -- the languages came out, so we wanted to really study the specific implications, but I think in general we could look at between 50 to 100 basis point improvement just looking at the first glance of the language. Julien Smith : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Wow, impressive. Cheers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI Gale Klappa : Hello Durgesh, how are you doing today? Durgesh Chopra : Hey, Gail, good afternoon and congratulations to Kevin and Scott as well, from my side. 2 questions for me. First, you -- I think I'm jumping the gun here but still okay to assume no equity in the plan through 2026 now? Gale Klappa : Yes. Yes, and yes. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Just wanted to clarify that. That's great. And then maybe just really quickly, some of your peers have talked about, given us some sensitivity on natural gas price increases and customer will impact to the extent that you can help us with that, that would be greatly appreciated. Gale Klappa : Sure. Let me give you a dollar amount and Scott can fill in some additional details. Depending upon -- and we have a natural gas natural gas provider in most of Wisconsin, Chicago, the northern suburbs of Chicago, portions of Western Michigan, and in places all over Minnesota. Depending upon where you are in our service area, it looks like the average bill increase for our residential customer, given what we've been able to do to mitigate higher gas prices with our hedging and storage opportunities. So the typical residential customer we'll see about a $25 to a $40 monthly increase for each month of the heating season based on what we're seeing today and what we've got locked in. And I can tell you that we have been very aggressive as always, with our hedging strategies, with gas storage, with option contracts, and we're pleased with how we've been able to mitigate the very sizable increase in the natural gas market for pricing. Scott? Scott Lauber : Now that's exactly correct, Gale. So we've got about 1/3 of our gas in storage that we fill throughout the year. And as Kevin mentioned, those storage levels are where we wanted to be at this time. And then we also have a lot of 1/3 of the hedging programs so that $25 to $40 looking at the current prices, and we don't expect that to move too much with our hedging program or storage inventory. Durgesh Chopra : And is there a percentage of total bill? What's that like 25% to 30%? Am I thinking that the right way? Scott Lauber : Yes, it's about 30% to 40% depending upon the area. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for having me here. Gale Klappa : Nice being ahead, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just the last one on Oak Creek care if I could. Just wanted to see with regard to the timeline of 2035, how that date was established at the right timeline as opposed to something earlier or later. Gale Klappa : It all -- it's a great question. It all comes back as we've talked this through with our operating people, with our technicians, with our outside experts. It all comes back to the proper transition to continue aggressive CO2 reduction, but maintaining reliability. And we're quite confident that by 2035 at the latest, that we can adjust our fuel source at Oak Creek, such that coal will be a backup source. I mentioned to you that our view is that our use of coal for power supply for our customers will be almost immaterial in our planning by 2030, less than 5% of our total power supply. So we're going to walk our way forward with continuing to increase the fuel blending at Oak Creek and making sure that we maintain that high standard of reliability, which we've got to have. But it really is a thought about how quickly can we go and maintain reliability in step increments. And that's our current view. So we'll see how it goes but we're very confident about the trajectory between now and 2030. And if the trajectory is even better then we'll see where we go. But, it's really our best estimate of how to make continued progress on aggressive environmental goals and maintaining reliability. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful, thanks. And just one last one from me on the new 6% to 7% growth target, what's different now versus prior to the change? Just give me your directional guidance and since growth has already generally trended at the high-end of the range, just wondering what prompted today's change in message? Gale Klappa : One simple thing, the refreshing of our 5-year Capital plan. We went from $16.1 billion 5-year Capital plan that we unveiled to you last -- the same time last year, to a 10% increase in the Capital needs to $17.7 billion. And when you look at that and you say, okay, no need for equity or run it through the model. What do we get? And it gives us confidence in the 6% to 7% growth rate. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, makes sense. I suppose WEC operational execution might feed into it a little bit as well, but appreciate the CapEx uplift there. Gale Klappa : Well, let me just say this, the operational execution had heard. Jeremy Tonet : And thanks for taking my questions, have a good one. Gale Klappa : Jeremy, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Gale Klappa : Afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hi, everybody. First question on O&M. I see Income statement is flattish on a year-to-date basis. Can you give us a figure on what you call the manageable or day-to-day O&Ms. And I know you've been targeting at 2% to 3% year-over-year reduction on that metric. Is that still a good number or should we expect some spending to be pulled from 2022 given the strong year-to-date earnings results? Gale Klappa : Xia has the answer for you. Xia Liu : So we're looking at the projection for the year taking into consideration what has happened over the past three quarters and what we expect to see. The 3% range is still a very good number, the day to day reduction compared to the annual 2020. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And the next question is on rate cases. Congrats on having such a clear near-term outlook. Can you talk about expectations for the next filings? I think you previously talked about May 2022 for Wisconsin. Is that still a good placeholder, or then [Indiscernible] smaller subs might see activity over the coming months? Gale Klappa : Well, yes, for our Wisconsin utilities late spring 2022 or certainly by no later than May 1 of 2022. That's the plan for filing our next rate reviews for the Wisconsin Utilities and recall that we're I believe the only state in the U.S. that has a 2-year forward-looking test period for those rate reviews. So we're looking forward to having the rate reviews done next year in Wisconsin. And Kevin and Scott, I don't know of any other plan. I mean, we just as Kevin described, we just finished rate reviews for North Shore Gas in Illinois, for Michigan Gas Utilities, and nothing else seems to be on the docket. Scott Lauber : Gale, just as I said in my remarks, we have no other plans at this particular time. Thanks for the question. Andrew Weisel : It's a great position to be in, thank you team. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Gale Klappa : Rock and Roll, Michael Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Just curious, in the 5-year plan, can you walk us through a little bit of the cadence of the change? Meaning is the change mostly in '22 and 2023 or is it more in kind of the back-end of the plan? Gale Klappa : Scott, do you want to take that one? Scott Lauber : Sure, Gale. And when we look at the plan, it's actually throughout the plan. Gale Klappa : Yes. Scott Lauber : In fact, when you look at it compared to this year's plan, the prior capital plan in years 4 and 5, it kind of tapered off. And in this particular year, especially as we laid out more and more as our energy transition and these projects get stays in over time, it's actually a flatter outlook as you look through it. So it really blended in well. And when you think about us putting in the generation and agreeing very measured, you've got to make sure you get the generation in and go to the next projects. So it's very deliberate on how we laid it out. Gale Klappa : Xia, anything you'd like to add. Xia Liu : I agree. I think the 2 areas would be the renewable investment and the grid and fleet's reliability investments. So we are adding investment in all 5 years in both categories. Gale Klappa : And Michael, as we look even beyond the 5-year plan that we just rolled out this morning, the new 5-year plan, one of thing that Xia just mentioned is very clear to us. The additional and upwardly trajectory investments in grid modernization and in reliability, those kind of investment dollars are going to continue well beyond -- the need is going to be there well beyond this 5-year period. Michael Lapides : Right. Oh, no, you've got a massive opportunity in Wisconsin and elsewhere on the system. Just curious though, I want to make sure I follow-up, can you give any cadence for like what years within just the Wisconsin regulated business, what amount of potential new megawatts of renewable is in this plan that hasn't already been announced. Gale Klappa : That hasn't been announced. Michael Lapides : Yes. Gale Klappa : Okay. Yes. So we have a number of them are already pending at the Wisconsin Commission, but go ahead, Scott. Scott Lauber : So there is approximately under solar side that hasn't been announced, approximately 700 megawatts on the solar and then another about 500 in the batteries. Michael Lapides : Got it. Scott Lauber : As you know, we have several of the largest wind farms are ready and nothing additional just that one that we've already filed for in the wind. Gale Klappa : And much of the batteries really can be deployed at existing sites. Michael Lapides : Got it. And so when you think about this, that 700 megawatts of solar, 500 megawatts of battery, that's spread throughout the 5-years of the plan. Gale Klappa : Correct. Yes. Correct. Scott Lauber : It's going -- you're going to see a consistent growth that we look at our renewables over the next 5-years. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then the one thing and it's smaller, but I noticed that there is an uptake in expected CapEx at ATC. And we haven't really seen an uptake in expected CapEx in ATC for a while. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that and whether this is a beginning of a cycle of continual increase in spend at ATC or is just a little bit more of a loss? Gale Klappa : And Kevin, of course, is the Chairman at ATC. I want to ask him to comment on this, but one of the things that is notable here that I think Kevin will continue is the ATC has a lot of maintenance Capital that is just really going to be required to maintain the reliability of the existing transmission network. And I think that uptake in maintenance Capital, Kevin, is a significant driver here. Kevin Fletcher : It is just like it is on our retail side that's exactly right. And also, as you know, there's a lot of renewable projects that are planned on board. So that'll help drive some of that CapEx investment over the next 5 years and even into the future from that perspective. So, maintenance as well as new needs from renewables as the drivers. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Gale Klappa : Your welcome, Michael. Hang in there. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Vedula Murti Hudson Bay Capital. Gale Klappa : Greetings Vedula? Vedula Murti : Hello, Gale. How are you? Gale Klappa : We're good. How are you doing? Vedula Murti : I'm okay. Gale Klappa : How's your friend Matt Doug doing? Vedula Murti : Matt Doug? Gale Klappa : Never mind. Your friend at -- Vedula Murti : I'm slow today. Gale Klappa : Is it WFAN in New York? Vedula Murti : Oh, yes, it's -- my twin brother works there, yes. You're doing very well. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Very good. Vedula Murti : Yes. A topic I'm going to ask about is electric vehicles and associated infrastructure. I mean, we saw the other day large [Indiscernible] by Hertz in terms of wanting to convert over their fleet in choosing Tesla itself as their preferred provider, etc. Can you give us a sense as to right now what how large your fleet that you have that's addressable to be converted to electric? And kind of how you're thinking about that over a period of time? And kind of based on how the fleet runs, CapEx characteristics in features, etc., that you'll be looking for as you do the transition? Gale Klappa : Vedula, are you thinking about our own fleet that you're asking about? Vedula Murti : Yes. Gale Klappa : All right. Vedula Murti : Yes, your own fleet. Gale Klappa : Well, we've got -- we've made a commitment. Actually, I'm going to ask Kevin to give you the details. We've made a commitment to part of a national plan to, in a very reasonable time frame, to continue to add materially to our operating fleet on the ground, to our bucket trucks, to our other vehicles to continue to transition them EVs. And then so I'll ask Kevin to give you the details on that and then I'll come back and I want to talk very briefly about a pilot program that is beyond our own fleet, but a pilot program for our customers that we just got approved a couple of months ago. Kevin? Kevin Fletcher : Gale for our cars and SUVs specifically for our fleet as you're asking about, we have a goal of 35% to be purchased of EVs between now and 2025. And then for the larger trucks, or our Class 3 trucks, our goal is that 25% of those would be EVs by that point in time. We're also looking at some of the fleets in storing, looking at our fork lifts and the equipment that we use for moving our products around. Looking at those and have targets for those as well. Gale Klappa : And Kevin wanted to buy some new electric motorcycles from Harley, but we'll talk about that later. Kevin Fletcher : Always pushing Gale. Thanks. Gale Klappa : And then Vedula, we just got approved a pilot program from the Wisconsin Commission. We're in the very early stages we'll talk more about it as we roll out some of these options for our customers, but essentially the pilot program is to help with the affordability for particularly large commercial customers, hotels, etc. the affordability of installing charging stations. So that program is again, just now in the earliest stages, we'll talk more about that as we get some customers to sign up. But early on as our key account folks talk to our large customers, there are some significant interest in moving forward with putting EV charging stations in offices hotels, parking lots, etc. Kevin Fletcher : I hope that responds to your question Vedula. Our fleet is one, but we're also working on large customers and the biggest opportunity as our large customers are looking at their fleets, not just our internal fleet, but that goes hand-in-hand with what Gail shared with the pilot that we're working on. Thank you for your question. Vedula Murti : Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Thank you, Vedula. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating and for all your good questions. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka. She can be reached at 4142214639. Thanks, everybody. So long.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group\u2019s conference call for Fourth Quarter and Year End 2021 results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.  Before the conference begins, I\u2019ll remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be made available approximately two hours after the call.  And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for calendar year 2021. First, I\u2019d like to introduce as always the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, who\u2019s now our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.  As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2021 earnings of $4.11 a share. This exceeded the upper end of our most recent guidance, which was $4.07 a share. Our positive results were driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery in our region, and our continued focus on operating efficiency. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. And as we\u2019ve discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. I would also note that the earnings we\u2019re reporting today are quality earnings with no adjustments. Now as you know, we\u2019ve been very active in shaping the future of clean energy. Looking back on 2021, we set some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. Across our generating fleet, we\u2019re targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, all from a 2005 baseline. In fact, by the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial. And our plan calls for a complete exit from coal by the year 2035. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on achieving net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. Now, we all recognize that advances in technology will be needed to decarbonize the economy by 2050 and hydrogen, of course, could be a key player, a key part of the solution in the decades ahead. To that end, we announced last week, one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. We are joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our newer natural gas powered units located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The project will be carried out this year, and the results will be shared across the industry to demonstrate how the use of hydrogen could materially reduce carbon emissions. Switching gears now, we\u2019re driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest five year plan in the company\u2019s history. The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability, and growth. One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next five years, these renewable projects will serve the customers of our regulated utilities here in Wisconsin. Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance. In summary, we believe we\u2019re poised to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. And now let\u2019s take a brief look at the regional economy. We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021, despite the prolonged pandemic. The latest available data show Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate down at 2.8%; folks, that\u2019s a record low and more than a full percentage point below the national average. Importantly, jobs in the manufacturing sectors across Wisconsin have returned to pre pandemic levels and major economic development projects are moving full steam ahead. Haribo, the gummy bear company is now recruiting workers at its brand new campus in Pleasant Prairie. Komatsu has begun relocating employees to its new state-of-the-art Milwaukee campus. Milwaukee Tools\u2019 downtown office tower is set to begin operations this month. And we see more growth ahead. For example, ABB, a global industrial and technology company, and Saputo, a leading dairy products company, have announced plans for major expansions in our region.  And finally, you\u2019ve heard the phrase a rising tide lifts all boats? Well, I\u2019m pleased to report that one of the most celebrated luxury boat makers in the world, Grand-Craft Boats is relocating its operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region. You know, JLo, George Clooney, Robert Redford, they\u2019re among the high profile clients of Grand-Craft, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see who shows up, you know, below deck at our next Analysts Day. Bottom line, we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy, and our outlook for long-term growth.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our utility operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. Looking back, we made significant progress in 2021. I\u2019ll start by covering some developments in Wisconsin. As Gale mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to make progress on the transition of our generation fleet in our ESG progress plan. I am pleased to report that our Badger Hollow 1 Solar project is now providing energy to our customers. You\u2019ll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin. We have also made progress on the construction of Badger Hollow 2. Currently, we expect an in service date in the first quarter of 2023. This factors in a delay of approximately three months, due to ongoing supply chain constraints. We do not expect a material change in the construction costs. In addition, the Public Service Commission has approved our plans to build two liquefied natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. Construction has started and we plan to bring the facilities into service in late 2023 and mid-2024. We expect this project to save our customers approximately $200 million over time and help ensure reliability during Wisconsin\u2019s coldest winters.  And we recently signed our first contract for renewable natural gas or RNG for our gas distribution business. We\u2019ll be tapping into the output of one of our large local dairy farms. The gas supplied each year will directly replace higher emission methane from natural gas that would have been entered our pipes. This one contract alone represents 25% of our 2030 goal for methane reduction. The Wisconsin-based company US Gain is planning to have RNG flowing to our distribution network of the end of this year.  The Commission also approved the development of Red Barn, a wind farm in southwestern part of the state. We expect our Wisconsin public service utility to invest approximately $150 million in this project and for it to qualify for production tax credits. When complete, it\u2019ll provide WPS with 82 megawatts of renewable capacity. And just this past Monday, we filed an application with the Commission for approval to acquire a portion of the capacity from West Riverside Energy Center. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service would acquire 100 megawatts for approximately $91 million. That\u2019s the first of two potential option exercises. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023. Looking forward, we expect to file a rate review for Wisconsin Utilities by May. We have no other rate cases planned at this time. Turning now to our infrastructure segment. The 190 megawatt Jayhawk Wind Farm located in Kansas began service in December. We invested approximately $300 million in this project. Overall, we have brought six projects online in our infrastructure segment, representing more than 1000 megawatts of capacity. And as you\u2019ll recall, we expect the Thunderhead Wind Farm to come online for the second quarter, and the Sapphire Sky by the end of this year. Including these two projects, we plan to invest a total of $1.9 billion in this segment over the next five years and we remain ahead of plan.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott. Thanks so much. We\u2019re confident that we can deliver our earnings guidance for 2022. We\u2019re guiding, as you know, in a range of $4.29 a share to $4.33 a share. The midpoint for $4.31 represents growth of 7.5% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors, at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. This also marks the 19th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, we are right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.  Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia? Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2021 result of $4.11 per share increased $0.32 or 8.4% compared to 2020. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2021 results on page 17. I\u2019ll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.10 compared to 2020. First, weather added $0.04, mostly driven by colder winter weather conditions compared to 2020. Second, continued economic recovery drove a $0.09 increase in earnings. This reflected stronger weather normalized electric sales as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges.  Let me give you some highlights on our weather-normalized retail sales. Overall, retail delivery of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were up 2.6% compared to 2020. We saw a continued economic rebound in 2021 in our service territory. Small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 4.4% from 2020 and large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine were up 5.1%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat, excluding gas used for power generation. Lastly, rate relief and additional capital investment contributed $0.14 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M drove a $0.03 improvement. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.17 of higher depreciation and amortization expense, and a net $0.03 reduction from fuel costs and other items. Overall, we added $0.10 year-over-year from utility operations. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company decrease $0.02 per share year-over-year. The positive impact of additional capital investment was more than offset by two factors, a 2020 full quarter that benefited 2020 earnings and an impairment that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 on an investment outside of the ATC service territory. This substantially wrote off all of the goodwill on the project. Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in 2021. This was mostly related to production tax credit from the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge Wind Farms. Finally, we saw an $0.18 improvement in the corporate and other segment. Lower interest expense contributed $0.07 year-over-year. Also we recognized a $0.04 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development. The remaining positive variance related to improved rabbi trust performance and some favorable tax and other items. In summary, we improved on our 2020 earnings by $0.32 per share. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163 million. The increase in cash earnings was more than offset by working capital requirements, mostly related to higher natural gas prices. As we resume normal collection practices in this spring, we expect working capital to improve throughout the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.4 billion in 2021. This represents a $471 million decrease compared to 2020, due primarily to the timing of the in-service date of Thunderhead Wind Farm. Turning now to financing activities, we opportunistically refinanced over $450 million of holding company debt during the fourth quarter. This reduced the average interest rate of these notes from 4.5% to 2.2%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contribution and the year-over-year increase in working capital, our FFO-to-debt was 15.7% in 2021. Finally, let\u2019s look at our guidance for sales and earnings. For weather normalized sales in Wisconsin, we\u2019re expecting 0.5% growth this year in both our electric and natural gas businesses, continued growth after a very strong year. In terms of 2022 earnings guidance, last year, we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter. We project first quarter 2022 earnings to be in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.70 per share. This forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. And as Gale stated, for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.29 to $4.33 per share.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you so much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.  Operator, we\u2019re now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Gale Klappa : Rock\u2019n\u2019roll Shar, how are you doing today? Shar Pourreza : How are you doing, Gale? All good. Gale Klappa : We\u2019re good. We\u2019re good. Yeah. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. So just, Gale, I know this seems like a perennial topic at this point but any sort of thoughts on the potential end of QIP in Illinois, it seems like efforts to eliminate it are getting traction yet again with obviously piece of legislation. There was a press conference on Monday. It\u2019s scheduled to expire, so what are your thoughts here? I mean, it\u2019s a little bit noisy. Just high level will be great. Gale Klappa : Terrific, Shar. Thanks for the question. First of all, this is really nothing new. Each year late in the session for the past five years a bill has been introduced, very similar bills have been introduced each year for the past five years. We don\u2019t expect any significant movement in that piece of legislation just exactly as what happened in the last five years. You are correct under current law, the QIP rider that allows us to put into basically begin earning a return on and off after new piping is put into service, that rider is scheduled by law to expire at the end of 2023, so we got a ways to go.  I would say this. We continue to try to educate and I think have had some significant success in helping most people to understand two things. First of all, the QIP rider and the way it works is actually the most cost effective way for customers to basically have us continue with a very needed pipe upgrade program. And secondly, the Illinois Commerce Commission last year, it authorized a study, as they asked us to hire an independent consulting firm called [indiscernible], which did more than a year\u2019s work in looking at what\u2019s needed in Chicago and they concluded that more than two-thirds, almost 80% of the remaining gas distribution pipes under Chicago have a useful life of less than 15 years. So the work has to be done. We\u2019re doing it the most cost effective way possible, not concerned about any near term legislation. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then maybe just shifting over to the infrastructure segment, it seems like it\u2019s been a bit of a longer time, since your last acquisition like Sapphire Sky, versus, I guess, your prior cadence. Just curious, is this sort of a symptom of anything in particular is, is there fewer opportunities or just a lot of competition supply chain, returns? Are you seeing projects maybe getting pushed out a little bit ahead of federal policy, clarity? Just maybe some thoughts there would be great. Gale Klappa : No, I\u2019m happy to answer that questions, Shar. First of all, as Xia mentioned and Scott, we\u2019re way ahead of plan. Shar Pourreza : Right. Right. Gale Klappa : So Jayhawk came into service a bit early on budget. Sapphire Sky, which we announced late last year is under construction, and I expect Sapphire Sky to begin commercial operation at the end of this year. We don\u2019t have anything particularly in the plan for this year, not because there\u2019s a paucity of projects, as we have a robust pipeline that we\u2019re looking at. I think some of the uncertainty over federal tax credits maybe slowing things down here, but we\u2019re way ahead of plan. We didn\u2019t have anything specific in this year\u2019s plan but we continue to look, we have a robust pipeline of projects and you will see some continuing effort here. We can be, as you know, very selective because we\u2019re so far ahead of plan. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. And just one real quick modeling question, is the ATC Holdco goodwill impairment that\u2019s in the driver slideshow? Just align me what that is? Gale Klappa : Yeah, I\u2019m happy to. It\u2019s an outside of the service area investment that years ago, the joint venture of Duke and ATC made in California, and will let Xia give you the detail. Xia Liu : Yeah, basically, we jointly own a transmission project. We acquired that back in 2013 and we performed the normal goodwill assessment on that project and decided that it\u2019s -- they\u2019re prudent for us to write down the majority of the goodwill. So it\u2019s a non-cash booking trade that we did in the fourth quarter 2021. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. And Gale, hopefully the \u201cno adjustments\u201d comment in your prepared remarks was understood well by the audience. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Bye. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, hey. Hey, afternoon. Thanks for the time guys. Appreciate it. And just to clarify the last question a little bit on people\u2019s in Illinois here. I mean, when you say like there\u2019s the CapEx spend that you have over \u201822 to \u201826 here, which obviously spans the lapsing of the current program, you\u2019re saying that if that program were to go away here that would -- that number ballpark would stay intact? Gale Klappa : Well, what would happen -- I mean, first of all, I think the most direct answer your question is that work is needed for safety and reliability. So we either would continue assuming that the rider was renewed by legislation post the end of 2023 or we would revert to, basically, annual rate cases. And again, if you recall, in Illinois, the Commission there uses forward-looking test periods. So, either way that works got to continue and the investment is in the range, depending upon the year of 280 million to 300 million a year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent, thank you. And then just pivoting on the transmission side here, just Cardinal-Hickory, obviously, the developments in the course last week. Just how are you thinking about options given the federal wildlife preserve, just in terms of alternate routes, timing, CapEx recovery, anything you could share there? Gale Klappa : Sure, happy to and for those who might not have been following Cardinal-Hickory, there is some activity in the courts with an environmental group challenging the permits that were issued by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, by the Iowa Public Service Commission, by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. So there have been multiple permits that would allow this more than 100 mile line to be built, coming out of Iowa into Southwestern Wisconsin, and then working its way over to the Madison area. So that\u2019s essentially a little more than 100 mile line. And to show you how long these projects take, that project was first envisioned and first discussed in 2011, so construction has been underway, essentially, in the Iowa portion. The portion in question where the permits are being challenged is in the southwestern part, it\u2019s an environmentally sensitive part of the southwestern section of the state of Wisconsin. It\u2019s called the Driftless Area. American Transmission Company, and again, this is partially owned, this line will be partially owned by ITC, ATC and the Dairyland Power Cooperative. The ATC portion, no one has questioned of the permits for that section of the line. So we\u2019ll see how all of this works out in court. But long story short, the Wisconsin Commission has reiterated the need for the line and reiterated their belief that the approval was appropriate and needed. We\u2019ll see how all this works out in court. At the end of the day, that line is an important part of moving renewable energy across the Midwest and into Wisconsin. So at the end of the day, I\u2019m confident something positive will come out of this, maybe a bit delayed, but we\u2019ll see what happens in the courts. I hope that helps, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No, absolutely. It\u2019s good color. Well, I\u2019ll leave it there guys. Thank you again, and best of luck and hope to see you guys soon. Gale Klappa : Sounds good. Thanks, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Jeremy Tonet of JP Morgan. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Jeremy. Rich Sunderland : Hi, it\u2019s actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Can you hear me? Gale Klappa : I can. What have you done with Jeremy? Rich Sunderland : Jeremy is sorry to miss but I\u2019m happy it is time for me today. Just may be starting around the load growth expectation for 2022. You\u2019re curious on the key drivers there and really how you think about realized recovery from the pandemic in 2021, maybe how much conservatism is baked in there for the \u201822 outlook. Gale Klappa : We\u2019re going to let Scott handle that for you. He and Xia on top of those details. I will say this, though, we\u2019re coming off of -- just as a reminder, we\u2019re coming off a very strong recovery in 2021 and we see continued growth in 2022. Scott, particularly, at least I was impressed by the numbers related to the small C&I segment. Scott Lauber : You\u2019re exactly right, Gale. In fact, when we go back and Xia and I look at our forecasts compared to what happened in 2021, we were right on with residential, it hit exactly on. The positive surprise was in small commercial and large commercial. So, we came in almost -- our original forecast was about 1.3% growth, we came in at 2.5 at a retail less mine. So, very happy with the growth that we saw. And as you look at it, we continue, in 2022, to expect residential as people can start coming back to work and you\u2019re starting to see more and more people return to work, residential will go down a little bit. And then that small commercial to grow continuing to expand in there and then once again, large commercial, we almost have a 2% growth in that large commercial sector. So we\u2019re seeing really, really good growth and you can see, as you look at our longer-term plan, a lot of good economic growth that Gale talked about on the call, so a lot of good economic growth comes in here too. Rich Sunderland : Thanks, appreciate the color there. And then maybe pivoting to this new pilot program in Michigan, what\u2019s the long-term target for blending and how do you think about this program in the context of your entire fleet? Gale Klappa : You\u2019re speaking, I believe, of the hydrogen pilot program that we\u2019re going to undertake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan at one of our newer RICE units. And just to put all of that in context for everyone, the RICE units, it\u2019s a technology that\u2019s been well proven, fueled by natural gas modular technology, if you will, does not require water permit. I mean, these are really advanced state-of-the-art power generation facilities and the project is really a pilot project. It\u2019s being designed right now. We will actually test burn hydrogen in a mix with natural gas up to 25% hydrogen, 75% natural gas and this project will actually be in the field in the fourth quarter of 2023. We with the Electric Power Research Institute will then analyze the results and, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the results will be shared across the industry. We\u2019re optimistic that this pilot program are the first of its kind in the US will demonstrate that hydrogen, with that particular technology, the RICE unit technology could be a major player going forward in decarbonizing the economy. Rich Sunderland : Great. Thank you for the time today. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the mind of Neil Carlson of Wells Fargo Securities. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Neil. Neil Carlson : Hi, everybody. Hello. Gale Klappa : Neil, are you getting snow or ice? Where you are? Neil Carlson : We\u2019re getting a lot of it and I\u2019m watching all my neighbors, and my wife and son shoveling the driveway right now, so I\u2019m feeling pretty good about this. I am wining. Gale Klappa : I just got a text from your wife, it said, you dog. Neil Carlson : Yeah, bad back. I can\u2019t do things anymore. So anyway, just a question on the solar. So obviously, Badger Hollow, it gets flipped a little bit, understandable given all the other supply chain issues, etc. But you\u2019ve got quite a bit more solar in the plan, as we look out over the next few years. And I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re -- if there\u2019s any \u2013 at this point, any reason to be concerned about costs or timing, from what you\u2019re seeing right now, as it relates to the additional, I think, 1300 megawatts that you plan to do over time? Gale Klappa : Yeah, great question, Neil. I think the short answer is with what we\u2019re seeing for 2022 and what we have under contract, no significant issues of and perhaps some timing. Down the road, Scott, your thoughts? Scott Lauber : Yeah, down the road, I mean, we\u2019re definitely watching, steel prices for the infrastructure and also the solar panels. But, as you look at natural gas prices, also, as those prices go up, the economics are still there. So I\u2019m not -- we expect that some of the costs will rise and we\u2019re monitoring it very closely, as you can imagine, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change your plan. Gale Klappa : Okay, I agree with Scott. And, Neil, one other point, the drive to decarbonize the economy is not abating in any way, shape, or form. So, we continue to see those investments as both needed and expected, as we go down the road. Neil Carlson : Perfect. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Neil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Durgesh. How are you doing? Durgesh Chopra : I\u2019m doing\u2026 I\u2019m doing well. Thanks for asking. Thank you for taking my question also. Xia, just this is a modeling question, the $0.04, the gain on clean energy fund, can you just elaborate on that? And then what quarter was that gain? And then I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not sort of modeling anything for 2022? That\u2019s a multi-part question, I\u2019m sorry. Xia Liu : That\u2019s okay. The, I think, on the second quarter call, I mentioned that we booked $0.03 of gain in the second quarter, then we picked up another penny in the fourth quarter, so $0.04 for the whole year. And when we develop the financial plan, we don\u2019t try to build any expectations of anything like similar like investment games like this. But if the market continues to point to the right -- point in the right direction and if we end up having more games, we\u2019ll be happy to book those but we don\u2019t count on those going forward. Gale Klappa : Sounds right, we\u2019d be delighted to book more gains. I think this was from a revaluation, if you will, of one particular investment in the fund that is -- these funds, as you know, investing in clean technology, some of them hit, some of them don\u2019t. This one hit very, very well and with the new round of funding and with the valuation, it was perfectly appropriate to revalue our investment. Durgesh Chopra : Awesome, thank you for that color. And then just maybe, your peers on a call today talked about, just want to sort of be interested in your progress and actually your execution and your capital plan for \u201821. Your peers mentioned some supply chain concerns and that to put some of their newer projects out. Just wondering, are you seeing any of those pressures and how do you actually do in 2021 versus your targeted CapEx plan? Gale Klappa : Well, I will ask Scott to give you his view as well. The one impact we had was really more from COVID than it was from supply chain. And that was a large solar farm, a large solar field called Badger Hollow 1 and that got delayed. It\u2019s now in service. That got delayed several months and it was a decision that we helped to make. At the point where we were deep in the pandemic and 2021, to continue the construction apace, we would have had to bring in about 150 crew people from outside the state to continue the construction at that point in time. In the middle of the pandemic, we thought that was really not a very good idea. So we agreed to a schedule delay, but Scott, no significant cost delay at all and that\u2019s now behind us. Scott Lauber : No, that\u2019s exactly correct. And everything else for 2021, our supply chain worked with our vendors to get everything in line. And we\u2019ve had a practice here for several years that we are ordering some of the long lead time materials a year, year and a half at a time for some of these major projects to make sure we have it, so. And then the only other item was just what we mentioned in our prepared remarks, whereas Badger Hollow 2, we see about a three month delay right now, but no significant cost at this time. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. Thank you guys. Much appreciate the time. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Durgesh. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Gale Klappa : Michael, how\u2019s your IT department? Michael Sullivan : Oh, yes. Fantastic. Gale Klappa : You might kind of reiterate no change in your rating, right, Michael? Michael Sullivan : Yeah. Yeah, for sure. He got to go. Yeah the first question maybe just, if you could give us a sense of what the clean O&M savings number was for 2021 and what you\u2019re embedding in \u201822 guidance. Gale Klappa : Happy to do and Xia has got it right in front of her. Xia? Xia Liu : So for the full year 2021 we ended with 1.6%, down year-over-year compared to 2020. So we guided earlier in the year 2% to 3% and we\u2019re right in that range. And what was \u2013 you had a second part of your question. Michael Sullivan : Yeah. What are assuming in \u201822? Xia Liu : Yeah, for 2022, we guide flat to 1% reduction from 2021. Michael Sullivan : Okay, great. Gale Klappa : And Michael, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sure you recognize this, but in light of the general inflation in the economy, we think that\u2019s really, really strong performance, we\u2019re very pleased about the plan we have in place to deliver what Xia is discussing. Michael Sullivan : Got it. Okay. And just curious if you could give any latest thoughts on where you think things might go with the pending issue at FERC as it relates to the RTO adder. Gale Klappa : My own guess, and this is just a guess, but my own view is the RTO rider is probably history, but to be replaced by something else, perhaps an incentive type mechanism. I\u2019m guessing that RTO rider, as we\u2019ve known, it probably won\u2019t survive. However, very important point, we have not assumed the continuation at all of the RTO rider in our forecast for 2022 earnings. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks and sorry, just one last one. It may be -- it looks like the FFO-to-debt metric ticked down a little bit year-over-year. Should we think about that as kind of stabilizing around that, 15% -- 15.7%, I think, where it came out as a go forward target? Gale Klappa : Xia, your view? Xia Liu : Yeah, we target the 15% to 16% measured by Moody\u2019s and S&P, so this is right in that neighborhood and as I said in the prepared remarks, the dip is really driven by year-over-year change of working capital and then that\u2019s largely attributed to higher natural gas prices, so we expect that to recover. And we also made a voluntary pension contribution in 2021. So overall, I think we\u2019re right in the target range for FFO to debt. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Michael. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been answered. I just want to follow up a little bit on the upcoming Wisconsin rate case. Two quick ones. First is do you see any potential for yet another stakeout or agreement to keep rates unchanged. I don\u2019t mean to be greedy, you\u2019ve done a great job managing the customer bills, just wondering strategically if you want to extend the stay out or if you feel it\u2019s time to have a conversation with regulators and intervenors, like you do every so often? Gale Klappa : It\u2019s a great question, Andrew and I think unanimously, we believe it\u2019s time to reset, if you will. Number of moving parts that are in our thinking and first of all, as you recall, we\u2019ve announced the retirement of four older coal fired units at our Oak Creek site. These are 1960s vintage units and we\u2019ve announced the retirement of the first two of those four in 2023, and the second two of the four in 2024. So there\u2019ll be retirement there, there\u2019ll be cost savings there and we really have been out of a rate case for so long that it\u2019s really just time to step back and reset. And I think every -- the commission staff, the intervenors, I think we all believe it\u2019s just time to take a thorough review again, and we\u2019re looking forward to that. Scott? Scott Lauber : It\u2019s going to be a very straightforward rate case. I mean, when you look at our capital investments that we\u2019ve made, the capital investments, and the majority of them, I think, when you look at what\u2019s already been approved and at commission right now, that\u2019s about 60% or a little over 60% of the rate base. And then you even add in new services and other reliability capital, almost all of this has been approved or great capital additions for reliability or decarbonizing the environment. So, it\u2019s going to be a pretty straightforward rate cases, as you see us pull the final numbers together here in the next couple of months. Andrew Weisel : Okay. And not to get ahead of that, but are you able to give us any kind of high level guess of what it might do to rates, directionally or qualitatively? Gale Klappa : Stay tuned. We\u2019re pulling everything together, the filing is due by May 1, so we\u2019ll certainly have a good conversation with you in advance of that. Yeah. Scott Lauber : And I think the other thing to remember is, this is a place where you do two-year forward-looking rate cases. So a lot of our capital projects and you see that capital spending, it\u2019s going to come in over two years, just like Gale mentioned, the retirement of those plants are over two years. So we\u2019ll factor that into, so it will be a multi-year filing we do here. Gale Klappa : Very straightforward case, though. We wouldn\u2019t expect of being to have anything as dramatic in terms of it. It is not a case about higher O&M. As Scott said, this is a case about capital, much of which will have already been approved capital needed for reliability and for decarbonization. Andrew Weisel : Very good. And just a quick follow up. Is it too early to talk about performance base rate making in this upcoming case? Gale Klappa : Yeah. And I\u2019m glad you asked. For those of you who have not followed it, perhaps quite as closely, the Commission did have an informational hearing about -- just about the concept of performance-based rate making. That hearing came out of more than a year\u2019s worth of work of the Governor\u2019s task force, looking at climate change, looking at decarbonisation, looking at what initiatives the state might put in place. But I think it\u2019s very clear from the informational hearing, that any changes in the process for putting rates in place in Wisconsin is going to be deliberate, it\u2019s going to be thoroughly thought through and I would not expect that to have any impact on our upcoming rate review. Andrew Weisel : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. By the way, before we go to the next caller, I just got a text from one of your brother and he says, given your performance, nobody\u2019s asking the most important question, Will Aaron Rodgers be back in Green Bay next year? The answer to that is I don\u2019t know but [indiscernible] is still with us for the bucks and rock and roll. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and I\u2019ll leave my John Moran props at home for now. Gale Klappa : There you go. Michael Lapides : Really nice night in New York last night. Real quick, just thinking about gas demand, if I go back over the last several years, kind of three, four years or so. Weather normalized gas to me in Wisconsin was actually pretty elevated, I can even go back five years. And now this year, you\u2019re forecasting about 0.5%. And then if I look at your November slide deck, you\u2019ll kind of forecast I think it\u2019s around point 0.7% to 1% demand growth. Can you just talk to us a little bit about the trajectory, meaning why coming down off that kind of -- yeah, first of all, what led to the abnormal kind of that three percentage plus range from a couple years ago and that lasted for several years? And then down to 0.5% now kind of as we\u2019re coming out of COVID, but then re-ramping back up. Gale Klappa : Yeah. And Scott and I will both take a shot at that. Good question, Michael. The easy question and the first piece is, what happened? Why did we not see growth in weather normal gas demand during this past year during 2021? And as we looked at the data, I think the answer it really pops out from the data and that is the effect of the pandemic. If you think about the most dramatically impacted segment of our customer base for the pandemic, it\u2019s small commercial and industrial customers, many of those premises were just closed during huge swaths of the pandemic. And so they weren\u2019t -- think about the restaurants that weren\u2019t cooking, think of the stores that were completely closed and not heated to the normal level. So clearly, the impact of the pandemic tempered the growth in customer demand for natural gas. But we still think we\u2019re going to see a growth trajectory. And Scott, we\u2019re still seeing strong customer growth. Scott Lauber : Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right. And when we look at it, we\u2019re looking at strong customer growth, about 0.5%, maybe 0.7%. And you can imagine we\u2019re factoring in that prices stay a little bit higher, conservation will continue and products will continue to become efficient. So looking forward, we\u2019re still assuming that 0.5% in the future will be at 0.7% to 1%. So, good growth. And to Gale\u2019s point, remember, the pandemic started in about March, so last year there\u2019s two months that weren\u2019t reflected in the previous year when the pandemic -- we didn\u2019t have a pandemic, so that\u2019s also why 2021 was a little weaker, because of just the timing of the pandemic. Xia Liu : Yeah, I would just add that, Michael, that we came pretty much on top of our forecast last year. So we guided that way, so we came out exactly what we thought it would happen last year. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then just following question, like, if I look at 2020 and 2021, earnings, both years actually would have been a higher number, if I backed out the kind of roughly the $0.08 of debt extinguishment costs that showed up in each year. So, the earnings number, like a lot of companies consider that non-recurring and I respect the fact that you don\u2019t back things in and out when you kind of stick with GAAP. But if I think about it, that is something that probably isn\u2019t going to happen in 2022 or 2023; I may be wrong there. So it implies the base would have actually been higher meaning the \u201821 starting point or the \u201820 starting point, but the growth rate into \u201822 and \u201823 would actually be a little bit lower just because the starting point is higher. Am I just kind of thinking about that, right? Or they\u2019re -- are you looking at the debt tranches at the Holdco and saying, hey, look, I\u2019m going to have other re-financings and I\u2019ll probably incur other similar like costs. Are there other moving parts, I\u2019m not considering? Gale Klappa : Mike I am going to ask Xia to answer the question about the Holdco debt. Let me if I can respond, though, a little bit more broadly. Of course, there are a number of moving pieces in any given year. But as you know, some companies in our industry basically adjust their way to a high growth rate, we don\u2019t do that. And, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking the question, because I think the quality of our earnings and the fact that we don\u2019t adjust our way to a higher growth rate, I think that\u2019s a differentiator for us. I mean, I really do and it shows up in things like cash flows, it shows up in things like dividend growth. And so what we\u2019re reporting, I mean, we don\u2019t nickel and dime you to death, with little adjustments here and there just to hit a growth rate. What we\u2019re reporting is high quality and real and GAAP. And with that, I\u2019ll get off my soapbox and let Xia respond. Xia Liu : Michael, I wouldn\u2019t just pick out that one item and readjust whatever you\u2019re trying to adjust because to Gale\u2019s point, we\u2019re very much focused on the quality of earnings. If we see favorable weather, we see stronger economic recovery than what we originally forecasted. If we also have some favorable tax resolution happen in 2020, in the year, we will remain opportunistic about debt refinancing and just to take advantage of the development. So I think that\u2019s just the normal course of what we do to manage throughout the year, so I wouldn\u2019t take one item out and adjust it out at all. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys much appreciated. Gale Klappa : Take care of Michael. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Gale Klappa : Paul, you changed your last name? Did you? Paul Patterson : No. That\u2019s called misunderstanding. So a lot of my questions have been asked and answered, but and I don\u2019t want to nickel and dime you guys to death, but just sort of a quick little follow ups here. The $0.06 for the taxes, is that -- how should we think about that going into 2022? Is there any sort of something unusual there or just how should we think about that going into 2022? Gale Klappa : Xia, your thoughts? Xia Liu : Yeah. So, no, nothing unusual there. As I said in the prepared remarks that was largely driven by the production tax credit, the additional projects that we brought online. So you know that we expect a couple more projects coming online, one in the middle of the year, the other end of the year, so we expect another $0.08 of pickups from this section and the only thing I would warn you is I wouldn\u2019t do $0.02 per quarter, because depending on the timeline and everything else, it could be skewed to one quarter versus another, but for the year, we expect another $0.08 increase. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just with the goodwill impairment, I know looks tiny to me. I mean, it looks like it\u2019s about a penny or something maybe, but just -- I was just a little bit curious. You guys did a test and it led to a revaluation. But what caused -- what changed in order to have the test? I am just sort of -- you don\u2019t think of the transmission project in California, like I\u2019m just sort of curious as to what made you guys say, hey, the goodwill doesn\u2019t apply anymore. Was there any particular event or anything near that that had that? Again I know, it\u2019s kind of nickel and diming you guys, but I\u2019m just sort of wondering. Gale Klappa : No, no problem. It was really basically a FERC ROE case that we got to FERC order and we took another look. Xia? Xia Liu : Yeah, so Gale mentioned one of the drivers for the year-over-year change for ATC. But if you\u2019re just looking at the goodwill impairment, we do that every year. We look at goodwill, we do the evaluation, we look at the assumptions, including forward-looking ROE, capital expenditure opportunities, and all the assumptions around that, it just -- the most recent assessment led us to believe that the goodwill should be written off. Nothing abnormal, it\u2019s just normal course. Paul Patterson : Right. But that\u2019s because basically you guys saw a lower -- because the lower ROE had been awarded, it impaired goodwill, is that how we should think about it? Do I understand you guys correctly or is it something else? Xia Liu : No, it is capital expenditure opportunities, it is nothing unusual. So we just look at the net cash flows and terminal value and apply the different assumptions, which led to the conclusion that the goodwill should be written off. Paul Patterson : Okay. Okay. Well, thanks so much. I appreciate it. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re more than welcome. Happy to have your questions. Gale Klappa : All right. Well, I think we\u2019ve worn you out, so thanks so much for participating in our conference call today. We appreciate all your questions and if you have any other questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka, her direct line 414-221-4639. Thanks, everybody. Take care so long for now. Operator : Again, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2022 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : From the home of the defending NBA champion, Milwaukee Bucks, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 earnings of $1.79 a share. Our results were largely driven by colder-than-normal weather, a strong economy and the performance of our Infrastructure segment. In light of this strong start to the year, we're raising our earnings guidance by $0.05 a share for 2022 to a range of $4.34 to $4.38 a share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of 2022. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong. And as we discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. We're also making good headway on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest five-year capital plan in the Company history. The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth. Over the past few months, we've received regulatory approval for more than $1.1 billion of needed capital projects in Wisconsin. Scott will provide more detail in just a few minutes. And we're preparing the way for further progress ahead. As you may have seen, our Wisconsin utilities filed rate reviews with the Public Service Commission for the two-year period in 2023 and 2024. We provided you with details in the earnings packet that we released this morning, and Scott will cover the highlights in just a moment. But the request, ladies and gentlemen, is all about the investments we need to make to enhance reliability for customers and continue the largest clean energy transition in our history. I would add that even with this request, the typical electric bill for our residential customers will remain below the national average. Switching gears now, many of you have asked about the solar panel investigation by the Department of Commerce. There clearly will be impacts across the industry. And at our companies, we may see some price increases and potential delays, particularly on the solar and battery projects that are still going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin. But the important point is that we do not expect the review by the Department of Commerce to have any material impact on our five-year capital plan. In summary, we're poised to continue our strong track record, delivering among the best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. We expect our ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance. Across our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the year of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial, and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of year 2035. Our capital investments fully support this transition. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net-zero carbon emissions from power generation on 2050. We're also investing in our natural gas distribution business and developing sources of renewable natural gas. Our plan is to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. With those goals in mind, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy. Hydrogen, for example, could be a key part of the solution in the decades ahead. So earlier this year, as you recall, we announced one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our natural gas-powered units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Engineering specifications and testing protocols are now being developed, and we're on track for actual blending of hydrogen in the unit this fall. We look forward to sharing results across the industry. And now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.8%, of course, well below the national average. The state's economy recovered throughout 2021 with especially strong growth in the manufacturing sector, and we continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region. For example, Amazon is expanding its presence in Southeastern Wisconsin with plans to lease a 1 million square foot building that is now under development. This expansion could add 400 new jobs to Amazon's workforce, a workforce that is already 3,000 strong in the region. Uline's workforce is also on the rise. Uline, as you may know, is one of the nation's largest suppliers of packaging and shipping materials. 700 employees joined Uline's workforce in Wisconsin last year, and Uline expects to add 300 more jobs this year. So we remain optimistic about not only the strength but the trajectory of the regional economy. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our utility operations and our infrastructure segment as well. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, across Wisconsin, we're making good progress on the transition of our generation fleet and our ESG progress plan. Work continues on our Badger Hollow II solar facility in the southwestern part of the state. We have a plan for delivery and acceptance of the panels, and we expect clearance from customs in a reasonable time frame, so we still project Badger Hollow II to be in service in the first half of 2023. And recently, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved our purchase of 90% of the Paris Solar Battery Park. It's the largest investment of its kind in Wisconsin history. Located South of Milwaukee, this facility will host 200 megawatts of solar generation and 110 megawatts of battery storage, providing our customers with sunshine after sunset. Regarding the solar panels, we have a line of sight on production and delivery, and we still project commercial operation by mid-2023. The situation with battery production and delivery is more fluid, and we'll work through the details we'll provide you with more information about potential delays in the battery installation of the Paris facility. And of course, we'll continue to examine our capacity situation in light of these developments. To put all this in perspective, it's worth noting that only 3% of our five-year capital plan is devoted to renewables and battery storage in 2023. Turning to other important projects. The commission has approved our plans to build 128 megawatts of natural gas generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The new facility will use seven reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, price units. These dispatchable units will support the retirement of older, less efficient coal generation. We expect this project to go into service in 2023. As Gale noted, WEC Infrastructure was a positive driver for the quarter with the addition of Jayhawk, which entered commercial operation in mid-December. Thunderhead will be the next wind farm to go into service, and we now expect that in the fall of this year. As discussed before, we remain ahead of schedule in our five-year capital investment plan for our infrastructure business. Turning to gas distribution. Just last week, we signed another contract to use renewable natural gas, or RNG, from a local dairy farm. This new agreement brings us halfway to our net-zero methane goal for the end of 2030. Now I'll touch on the rate filings Gale mentioned. On April 28, we filed a rate review with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Our proposed plans would help us to continue to reduce emissions, strengthen key infrastructure and provide affordable power to customers. I'll discuss the request to set rates for We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. You can refer to Pages 14 and 15 of the earnings packet for more details. Under our plans for the two utilities, the typical electric bill for residential customers would increase approximately $5 to $6 a month in 2023 or roughly 5% to 6%. Key drivers for our proposed increase include capital investments in renewables, battery storage, natural gas generation and LNG storage for our gas distribution system. Many of these projects have already been approved. In addition, we are introducing grid hardening projects that are part of a 10-year plan to protect our system against severe weather, and the rate review includes other costs that have been authorized to recover in previous proceedings. In summary, this represents only the second time in eight years we have asked for a base rate increase for We Energies. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023. We have no other regulatory reviews pending across our companies. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. As you may recall, our Board of Directors, at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. And today, we're reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth at 6% to 7% a year. Again, we do not see any need to issue new equity. Next up, Xia will provide more details on our first quarter numbers and our second quarter guidance. Xia, all yours. Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Our 2022 first quarter earnings of $1.79 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 13. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.15 compared to the first quarter of '21. First, rate base growth contributed $0.13 to earnings. As we continued to execute on our ESG progress plan, we grew our utility rate base by over 7% last year. Next, colder winter weather conditions drove a $0.05 increase in earnings when compared to the first quarter of last year. Also, continued economic recovery added $0.01, reflecting stronger weather normalized sales during the quarter. Overall, we saw a continued economic rebound in the first quarter of 2022. Weather normalized retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.6% compared to the first quarter of '21. Residential natural gas sales were up 1.6% from the first quarter of '21, and commercial and industrial natural gas sales were up 6.8%. Additionally, weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 0.7% compared to the first quarter of '21. These positive drivers were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.01 increase each in day-to-day O&M and fuel. Overall, we added $0.13 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in the first quarter of '22 compared to the first quarter of '21. Higher production tax credits, driven by strong wind production, added $0.03 in earnings. We also recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution in Q1 this year from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool that were related to Storm Arie. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segment decreased $0.01 when compared to the first quarter of '21. Unfavorable rabbi trust performance resulted in a $0.02 earnings reduction. This was partially offset by a pickup of $0.01 from our investment in a clean energy fund. In summary, we improved on our first quarter of '21 performance by $0.18 per share. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $682 million. Cash earnings and recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $384 million in the first quarter of '22, a $207 million decrease from 2021. This was primarily driven by spending on Jayhawk wind farm. In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter. For the quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.87 per share in the second quarter last year, which included an estimated $0.03 from favorable weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our 2022 earnings guidance to a range of $4.34 to $4.38 per share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the new range. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Yes, congrats on the bucks, making it to around two of the playoffs. Gale Klappa : Going to be tough series, but they sure showed up yesterday. Shar Pourreza : For sure. For sure. So Gale, just on the Wisconsin rate cases and specifically storm hardening, grid resiliency, how should we sort of think about maybe the timing and pace of the spending for the 800 miles of undergrounding planned over the next decade. What's the sort of the cost per mile? And is 800 miles just a starting point for maybe an expanded program. Gale Klappa : Yes. I think, Shar, the way -- the best way to look at it is what we have proposed in the rate review is really the start of about a 10-year program that we see ahead of us to maintain reliability and to really make sure that we continue to be one of the most reliable utilities in terms of outage history and restoration and country. We've had a great track record, but we're seeing -- I mean last year, in particular, I mean, we saw some very serious storms, I don't think that's going to abate necessarily. We also have aging equipment. So, we have laid out and Scott can give you more detail, but we've laid out internally a 10-year program. What you see in the rate case, Scott, is the start of that. Xia Liu : Correct, Gale. So yes, the start of it is starting in 2023, and it's about $700 million right now, but we'll continue to evaluate it like we do. We sold $700 million over that 10-year period, but it's more than just undergrounding. It's adding the technology to the grid, more re-closures, more of that self-feeling technology, similar to the benefits we had in a couple of projects in Northern Wisconsin, where we saw a 97% improvement. So looking forward to this program, but it's about $700 million. But of course, as we get into it, we'll evaluate it more. Shar Pourreza : Okay. And Scott, this is incremental to the plan? Or is this inclusive of the current plan? Scott Lauber : No, that has been factored in our 10-year plan, as we laid that out last year or at our five-year plan. But remember, that just get our runway -- a lot longer runway as we look through this because the majority of our system is getting to that 50, 60, 70 years old, and that was the time I think how you renew that system. Gale Klappa : Shar, we've got some transformers as old as you are. So we really need to kind of replace them. Shar Pourreza : There are only 22-year-old transformers. That's pretty -- and then just, Gale, you've done -- you guys have done a great job kind of reducing O&M historically. I guess, now, I guess, how are you thinking about your current O&M target of flat to 1% reduction. In light of some of the observable inflationary pressures we're seeing in the market to see if they're not transitory, and just remind us what level of O&M reductions for '23 and '24 are you assuming in the case you just filed in the cases? Gale Klappa : Well, we'll take the answer in two pieces, and I'll ask Xia to give you the '23 number for the rate review. But long story short, for 2022, our target was a zero to 1% reduction in day-to-day O&M. We still believe that's achievable, and that's what's in our plan. And then when you look at the filing for the rate review, in light of inflation, in light of wage increases, et cetera, we have proposed in the rate review a modest increase in O&M for 2023. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes. So, if you compare to the last rate order in 2020, our rate filing for O&M is actually a net reduction of 2.6%. So compared to what the commission ordered us three years ago, we actually proposed a reduction. But if you compare it to actual 2021, it's a modest increase like Gail mentioned. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Got it. And then just real quick last from go, it sounds like thank you for addressing the supply chain constraints and circumvention issues, but I just want to bring this home. Do you still feel comfortable with the 700 megawatts of solar in the current plan, which you haven't filed for approvals on yet? Or could we see some of that replaced with for instance, let's say, wind, Can you pivot if these tail risks aren't subsided? Gale Klappa : Yes, it's a great question, Shar. I think the short answer is yes. We're at a point where pivots are certainly still doable, and let me be clear about that. Scott covered with you the two projects that are really on the immediate horizon that have already received regulatory approval that are already in the earliest stages of construction. And we either have a plan or a line of sight on those two projects related to the solar panel. So, we feel very good about that. When you think about the projects that are still going through the solar and battery projects that are still going through Wisconsin regulatory review, there, there may be price increases, there may be some delays. But if you think about, as Scott said, if you think about our total five-year capital plan, less than 3% of that is in solar and batteries in 2023. And -- and we've got significant projects that are not solar-related like the very important capacity additions of the rice units in Northern Wisconsin. And yes, we could still, if we needed to pivot to win. So, we feel very good about where we are even in light of the difficult situation posed by the Department of Commerce. Shar Pourreza : Congrats on the results. And hopefully, Beth continues to make a really speedy recovery. Gale Klappa : Great. Thank you so much, Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hope you guys are all doing well and Beth, hope you're doing in particular, doing better here. Gale Klappa : Very good. She is well at the moment. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just coming back kind of filling out on what I heard you guys say a moment ago and then also in the remarks here, any net delays to your projects, forget '22, but really in that later period in '23 and '24? How does that impact the rate application that was filed right first off? And then secondly, it sounds as if the -- which there's anything shifts here, et cetera, you're committing to be largely intact in your numbers regardless. But again, I just want to make sure I would like to close the gap on that last question. Gale Klappa : Yes. Great clarify question, Julien. Yes, given everything we're seeing right now, the five-year capital plan, the ESG progress plan at $17.7 billion, we are -- we don't see anything that will derail that five-year capital plan. Could something move between here or there, depending upon how long this Department of Commerce investigation goes, could we pivot to win, win instead of a particular solar installation in a given year? Yes, but we have a lot of flexibility. Scott? Scott Lauber : No, absolutely. So we'll be looking at it and -- and as you recall, in Wisconsin, we have a two-year forward-looking test year. So that will give us an opportunity to look at 2024, any effects on the timing of the batteries and the cost of the solar as we look at putting that next part of the case together. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely, appreciate it. And then just if you can speak to this a little bit more, I mean, especially if you think about the solar net impact as well over time, like where you are within your CAGR. But I think the bigger point I wanted to bring up here is what's driving the guidance raise already and pointing to the upper end already, right? I mean just to frame it here, it's not -- it doesn't seem as if your retail sales outlook at 0.5% year-over-year growth is particularly outsized. Weather is obviously a tailwind, but O&M looks like a little bit of a drag ex the rabbi trust. Like what's driving this pivot here, if you can speak to it? And also, where are you in this long-term EPS outlook, especially net of any in solar perspective here? Gale Klappa : All right, two points -- two pieces to the question. And the first is, essentially, the nickel raise is really the result of -- results outside of our utilities. I mean if you think about the performance of the Infrastructure segment, if you think about the penny pickup from the technology fund that we've invested in, basically, you get to about $0.05. So essentially, if you think about being on target with a strong start, but being on target for the remainder of the year for our utility earnings projections, and then you layer on what happened in the first quarter with our Infrastructure segment and with the pickup from the Energize Fund, I mean basically, there was no reason not to raise guidance by $0.05. So that was the thinking essentially as we raise the range. And again, we expect to come in at the top end of that range. And then longer term, as I said in the prepared remarks, we still believe we're at 6% to 7% earnings per share growth for the longer term. And again, no need to issue equity. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And it seems like, as you said, you took the words out of my mouth or the next clarification. The energy infrastructure is tracking well above expectations. It was above expectations for 1Q and really the delta here for the balance of the year, which would be accruing that into the energy in front, not as if there's some further offset through the course of the year that would impact the infrastructure segment? Gale Klappa : You are correct. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Michael Sullivan : Yes, sorry to beat a dead horse here, but just sticking kind of with some of the solar questions to start off. I guess first, can you just clarify when you say line of sight on production and delivery, does that mean you physically have the panels for your near-term projects? And then also if we could just get a little more color on what exactly is going on, on the battery side of things? I wasn't quite following what's causing the delays there. Gale Klappa : Okay. Sure. We'll be happy to do that, and Scott can provide you with some detail as well. But let me just start out by saying this. We have, as Scott mentioned, a plan, the first project, which is the first project we mentioned, which is the very nearest term one, which is Badger Hollow II. We got a plan. We know where the solar panels are. We are confident in the schedule. So, that's really pretty clear. On Paris, which really got approved just very recently, there, we have clear sight on our production schedule and a delivery schedule and a clear sense given precedent that there won't be a customs problem. Scott, do you want to add on to that? Scott Lauber : No, that's exactly -- we've talked through this quite a bit, walking through the details on logistics. And looking at our time frame, the sites are getting ready right now. So, it's just a matter of delivery of the panels. And like Gale said, we laid out the delivery and still feel comfortable with that beginning of the year, mid-year 2023 for the completion of those two sites on the solar aspect. As we look into the batteries, the batteries across the country has just been a little more volatile on trying to get the delivery and production of those batteries delivered to a site. So, we're just very cautious retook through more of the details. We first wanted to work through the solar aspects of it, and that will go after the batteries and lay out on schedule for those. Gale Klappa : And Scott is right into all that in perspective, if you look at our five-year capital plan and the 2023 spending, so the 2023 spending on batteries that was in the five-year plan, the 2023 spending on batteries is like 1% of our $17.7 billion capital plan. So, it's not going to move the needle significantly one way or another. Is that helpful, Michael? Michael Sullivan : That is, if I could just follow on there. In terms of the cost of things, I think you mentioned a little bit of fluidity there, too, but maybe if you can just level set on what you saw for some of your most recent solar projects and then where things are tracking at least as of right now on some of the nearer-term ones? Gale Klappa : Yes. For the future solar projects, Scott, it wouldn't surprise me to see a 30% to 40% increase compared to what we've been seeing in the past. Scott Lauber : Correct. Correct. And remember, the first solar projects we put in were extremely at a low rate, the $1,300 a kilowatt. So, those first two projects we put in about $1,300 a kilowatt hour. The next ones are going up a little bit more probably in the shorter term, probably 20% to 30% and then Gale in the longer term, probably in 30% to 40%. Gale Klappa : And battery pricing, as Scott said, has been a bit less predictable and kind of all over the place. So, we'll see how the battery situation shakes out. But I hope that gives you some sense of what we're seeing on the solar side. Michael Sullivan : Yes, super helpful. If I could just squeeze one more in, shifting over to the rate case, is there precedent in Wisconsin for the limited rate reopener that you're asking for in 2024? Just trying to jog my memory a little bit there? Gale Klappa : Yes, there's certainly ample press for a limited reopener, absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Unfortunately, I'm going to ask you for your sort of thoughts and views as an industry leader on, how this investigation actually goes? I mean, what are you hearing and what do you think the Department of Commerce is headed here? Gale Klappa's views. Gale Klappa : Oh, gosh. Well, that on a dime won't get you much at Starbucks, but I'll be happy to give you my opinion. I do think that there's going to be a significant amount of pressure on the Department of Commerce. You're seeing it already. I think a letter went to the Department of Commerce either Friday or today signed by 26 senators, basically saying, Look, Department of Commerce, this is really messing up the industry in the U.S. So please get on with the investigation, try not to take nine months. My sense is that the Department of Commerce will be thorough. It's their duty to be thorough, but my sense is, given the real need, I mean, 85% or more of solar panels, utility-scale solar panels that are produced are coming from outside the United States. So that just gives you a sense of the magnitude of the issue and the potential impact of the delay. So my sense is the Department of Commerce will probably -- they have a duty to be thorough, but I'm guessing that they might speed up the review process to the extent they can, and we'll just have to see where they go. It could the industry stand more tariffs, nobody would like it, but potentially that might be the case. I think it is really unpredictable as to where the DOC will eventually go. But this is a very important energy security issue for the United States. So my sense is there will be a balanced decision. And I think you could also see -- if worse comes to worst, you could also see some executive action out of the way house. So too early to give you anything more definitive than that other than I think there will be a continued drumbeat to conclude one way or another, this investigation thoroughly, but as soon as possible. Durgesh, I hope that helps. Durgesh Chopra : That helps tremendously, thanks Gale. And just one quick clarification, the 30% to 40% increase that you just mentioned, I think, in response to an earlier question, that is before any additional tariffs are put in place. Am I correct about that? And would be what could be the implications of additional tariffs, if I can answer that question? Or maybe it's too early. Gale Klappa : I think for the second part of the question, it's probably too early, Durgesh, But the short answer is yes. The 30% to 40% we were quoting is before any impact of the Department of Commerce investigation. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Well wishes to Beth, and thank you for having me. Just want to start off, I guess, -- we've talked a lot about the potential solar delays here, as you noted. And maybe just wondering, if we could in a little bit more about reserve margins in your service territory and the outlook there. Had you noted demand continues to grow? There's coal retirements. There could be delays with the star and batteries being delayed. And just wondering, I guess, how you think about reserve and risk? Gale Klappa : Well, it's a great question, and you probably saw the information released by MISO just a few days ago about concern about this coming summer even in terms of potential capacity shortfalls, particularly if there's a warmer than normal summer. And as Scott mentioned in his remarks, obviously, and we continually do this, but obviously, we have to relook at our capacity situation. We have retirements on tap in -- as part of this five-year plan. So nothing definitive yet, but we will certainly have to relook our capacity situation. I think in Wisconsin, certainly for this summer, I think we're in reasonably good shape. But actually, Scott and Xia and I were talking about this earlier. The fact that MISO is signaling a potential concern, not only potential concern, but a real concern about reliability and potential outages in a hot summer in the Midwest. It kind of doesn't surprise us because of what we've been seeing. You may have heard me say over the last few years, a couple of years in particular, that even on temperature days in Wisconsin, we were being asked by MISO to run our units at full capacity for lengthy, lengthy periods of time to help keep energy in balance to meet demand in the MISO market. So we kind of saw this potential shortfall coming, and we'll see how it goes. Again, I think for Wisconsin, we're in reasonably good shape. I'm guessing we'll be producing a lot of energy that will be fed into the grid to help keep things stable this summer, which is a good thing for us, obviously. But in the longer term here, we have to see the length of the delays, any issues with battery production and delivery. And as Scott said, we will continually relook at our capacity situation. And I hope that helps, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Yes, that is helpful there. And then maybe just pivoting towards sales a little bit here. As it relates to retail electric sales growth, could you provide more color, I guess, on the drivers between the delta with your initial expectations versus what was achieved in the quarter? And do you see retail growth projection higher at this point? Just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color there on how your outlook might have changed as it relates to those sales? Gale Klappa : Well, I think I'm going to let Scott and Xia give you some more detail. From my standpoint, the longer-term outlook is unchanged. I mean you really can't move your expectations based on one quarter, particularly a quarter where it was colder than normal. Weather normalization is an art, not a science. So, we give our best estimate of what's weather normal and what's not. But I think, at least, Scott, from my opinion, the backdrop and strength of the manufacturing sectors in Wisconsin is a big driver for us. Scott Lauber : No, you're exactly right. So two items, really, when I look at the data, you see that large manufacturing in the -- in our sector or in our company, we track about 17 sectors, a couple of them in the manufacturing. We're seeing that as being very positive. In addition, this quarter, although it is just one quarter, that small commercial industrial was ahead of our forecast. So just business is getting back open, even opening more than we anticipated where the pandemic loss, et cetera. So, they've been growing pretty well here. So really happy to see that small commercial going and the large industrial was positive, particularly in the manufacturing sector. So, overall, I'm very happy with where the sales are coming in. Gale Klappa : And I'll add one anecdotal thing. We joke that our EV penetration doubled when Xia moved to become our CFO because she brought her Tesla with her. But I noticed yesterday, I thought this was amazing. And we have nothing in our forecast for any significant EV penetration in that five-year plan. But in the large condo building where Judy and I live north of Downtown Milwaukee, they're basically 99 units, seven of those units now have EVs. That really surprised me. I just happened to pass through our underground garage yesterday, and there are seven Teslas with charging units in our own condo building. So I think, if anything, we may be conservative about the EV penetration. And we're also getting a lot of interest in our EV pilot. So that really started beginning of this year that pilot went in place. So, we're seeing a lot of good people -- a lot of good inquiries on commercial side, which I expect that, some nice load coming potentially here and then also on the residential side. So just early yet, but a good indication. The challenge is now that everyone's got to get the vehicle. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : And good luck in Boston tomorrow night, I'm a Yankee fan. So any time a Boston team loses, I am so happy. Just maybe two quick questions. One of them, obviously, a lot of the call delays on the solar. You talked about rising cost on some renewable projects before any impact of Department of Commerce investigation. I think the Company's plan over the years has been more of a diversified portfolio, and it's benefited a lot of the customers. Do you see any change from the regulators on the headwinds that are going on right now with renewable to maybe change the strategy that's going forward and maybe keep going for this diversified generation portfolio? Gale Klappa : That's a great question. And I think actually, we have ongoing conversations, obviously, with policymakers particularly in Wisconsin. And I can tell you that there is -- there has been and continues to be both strong support for decarbonization. And as you know, we have some of the most aggressive decarbonization goals in the industry, but also a strong, strong support for energy security. I mean we talk with the governor's office. We talk and we can with commissioners. We talk with the state Department of Natural Resources, which is the state and to a person with all past gubernatorial administration since I've been here and with the current one, there is a strong support to do both. Yes, to carbonize, but do not take your eye off the ball. We have to have energy security. That hasn't changed, and I don't think it's going to. I think in Wisconsin, we're pretty practical. And I believe that over time, we can do both. We can decarbonize the economy. We can still provide reliable power but we can also -- we also have to do that with a variety of energy sources. And as you've heard me say, we look at everything through what I call the ARC, A-R-C, affordable, reliable, clean. It's got to be all three, but there is going to be a transition and natural gas is going to be a significant part of that transition in terms of power generation. I mean, you just cannot keep a major economy alive in trucking without the range of options that we have in our portfolio today. Anthony Crowdell : And last one, and I apologize if I had this wrong. And maybe it's all you guys being, I guess, too customer focused if there's such a thing, I believe you filed for the same ROE request in this rate filing as you currently have. And as I've seen other utilities across the country, rate cases, maybe the last month, two months, given this inflationary environment, they've all had a significant step-up in what they're requesting for ROE. Just thoughts on the level of ROE that you guys have filed for. Gale Klappa : We think that level of ROE is appropriate. It reflects our cost of capital. And basically, with our planning, at that level of ROE, again, with the opportunity to earn above the allowed ROE and the sharing mechanism that provides benefit to both customers and shareholders. We just think it's an inappropriate approach at this point in time and would provide us the cash flows to maintain strong credit ratings. So when we look at our -- when we look at the overall situation, we think it's the right level for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Obviously, you've got your bias at the box. I'm always going to lead with a go grid. A couple of questions for you, one on the rate proposal. If I read this right, the electric side has fuel costs embedded in it. So the gas side, can you just remind me what's happening to the customer -- the total customer bill these days, not just the base rate component of the bill? But I'm just trying to think about what's going on in Wisconsin relative to some of the neighboring states to the total bill? Gale Klappa : Scott, Xia, you want to give that a shot? Scott Lauber : Yes. So, the numbers that we did provide on the call the $5 to $6 a month is the total bill. It'll still below the national average and right in line with our Midwest peers as it relates -- and this does include in fuel at the time when we put the case together. But just like every year, we'll file for a fuel update and the commission has a process of updating the latest forecast on gas prices, et cetera, in the fall of each year. And that's an ongoing -- every year we go in for that. So -- but it's really -- right now, it's a very modest number at that $5 or $6. That may change a little bit when you look at that final fuel that even makes the case even better for renewables as we put more renewables in and have that fuel-free resource there. Gale Klappa : Xia, what would you like to add? Xia Liu : No, I think that I think Scott really covered it. Overall, we look at our reach requests and compared to the peers in the Midwest and compared to the national average, we feel really good about the overall customer impact. Gale Klappa : And as Scott said, the $5 to $6 a month for the typical residential customer at this stage of the game does include an estimate of fuel. Michael Lapides : The other question I had is when you are entering the year, I know asked about electricity demand. And I know there's some -- Gale, you and I have talked about at length over the years. But just curious, when you all entered the year, what was your guidance for weather normal gas demand growth? Because it seems that and one quarter doesn't make a long-term trend, but it seems that gas demand growth again is kind of surprising to the upside again? Gale Klappa : Yes. I think going in, Scott, was a 0.3%. Scott Lauber : 0.5%. Gale Klappa : 0.5%. And remember, and we all discussed this with the normalization in the first quarter when it's colder than normal is not the, the best indication. On the other hand, gas sales have been very strong. I mean we see several customers still converting from oil -- fuel oil to natural gas and actually commercial and customers last year converted from coal to natural gas, getting cleaner and yet the usage is up. I do think though as you get into the fall, gas usage as -- when you think about gas costs, what you're seeing in the paper every day, people may be putting in some more insulation and looking for conservation a little bit more this year. So, we'll see, but we're -- we always want to be looking at that -- our gas growth in line with customer growth and surprise on the upside with usage. Gale Klappa : Yes. Scott is making a great point, but I will say we continue to see -- as Scott said, we continue to see good customer growth on the gas distribution side of our business. And it really is a mixture of things. It's -- I mean, my gosh, some people have 40-year-old oil-burning furnaces. They're not putting oil burning furnaces in today. They're converting to natural gas. And then as Scott said, we have customers, industrial customers that are actually getting cleaner by switching off of their own generation and moving on to our gas distribution network. So, we see both usage growth, but also strong customer growth. In fact, in most months of last year, our gas customer growth exceeded our electric customer growth. Michael Lapides : One last one. Just curious, what I think the earnings growth kind of annualized multiyear is for ATC, meaning for the transmission business? Gale Klappa : And looking at that in the five-year plan, it's probably roughly 4% to 5% a year. Xia Liu : Yes, that's about right. Michael Lapides : Okay. So kind of in line with rate base growth? Gale Klappa : Yes, exactly. Except, we don't have anything in there for Tranche 1 of Future 1. And you know what I'm referring to, MISO is going through a long, long planning process, which they call Future One and Future One has three tranches. So there's Tranche 1, which is now kind of creeping toward resolution, if you will. And I think MISO has said they would vote on the projects in Tranche 1 in late July, if I remember correctly. We don't really have anything in there in our five-year plan, Scott, for Tranche 1. Scott Lauber : No, we don't have anything in our five-year plan. But when you think about it, those projects probably won't start hitting until the end of the decade. So, I mean, let's talk about the transmission, and we'll see more about it in July. But once again, it probably won't hit this year's five-year plan, maybe the next -- but the last couple of years, from ATC, we've actually seen some growth just from the renewables that are happening in the system of Wisconsin here alone. Gale Klappa : And from upgrading aging transmission lines. So just wanted to be clear, when we said 4% to 5% asset-based growth coming out of ATC, it doesn't assume anything about Future One. Operator : And for the last question, we have Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Gale Klappa : Not wonderful an award-winning as usual, and you're having a bad day, Paul. Paul Patterson : Not a particularly bad just an average day. No. It's what it is. Beggars can't be choosing, but... Gale Klappa : I thought our call would brighten your day. I don't know, Paul. Paul Patterson : Well, it is in its own way. So, it's always sunny in Wisconsin, I guess. So actually, my transition question was asked just now. But there is this proceeding is regarding the road map to zero investigation that's been looking at of all things PBR, performance-based regulation, and affordability and energy efficiency and stuff. And I'm just wondering, since I've got you, any -- I mean, to me like they put out an order few weeks ago sort of saying that they're still sort of interested in it and they're exploring it. But do you have any thoughts about where this might lead? Gale Klappa : I think there's a very, very deliberate process that has just begun at the Wisconsin Commission to investigate whether there are any other regulatory incentives or any other changes that could help to continue to incentivize the right kind of decarbonization, again, without compromising energy security. So, we see this as a -- as always, with Wisconsin regulation, forward-looking far-side balanced and -- but I do think they're in the very earliest stages of considering any potential alternatives. So, I wouldn't see anything, for example, that would impact our current rate case. Paul Patterson : Okay, fair enough. We'll see what happens. I really appreciate it. And thanks so much. Gale Klappa : You welcome. Take care. All right. Well, folks, I think that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact Beth. She won't be on mute. (414) 221-4639. Thanks, everybody. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman and WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Hot town summer in the city. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 earnings of $0.91 a share. A warm start to the summer, solid results from our Infrastructure segment and continued execution of our capital plan were major factors that shaped yet another strong quarter. In light of this strong performance, we're again raising our earnings guidance for 2022, this time by $0.02 a share, to a new range of $4.36 to $4.40 per share. We expect to reach the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Our balance sheet and our cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without any need for new equity. During the quarter, we continued to move forward on major initiatives across the enterprise, including investments in our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan. Our focus remains on building and maintaining a highly reliable infrastructure, delivering energy that's affordable, reliable and clean. Scott will provide you with a project update in just a few moments. Now you may recall our recent announcement about an adjustment that we made to our schedule of power plant retirements. We plan to extend the operating lives of the 4 older units at our Oak Creek site. The retirement of units 5 and 6 will be delayed by a year until May 2024. Units 7 and 8 will be delayed for about 18 months until late in 2025. These coal-fueled units have a total rated capacity of 1,100 megawatts. We based this decision on 2 critical factors : First, tight energy supply conditions in the Midwest power market; and expected delays in the delivery of solar panels and batteries, delays that will clearly affect the in-service dates of renewable projects that are now going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin. Keeping the older units at Oak Creek online a bit longer for capacity purposes makes great sense for our customers because we can avoid the need to purchase higher cost capacity in the MISO market. But even with the extension of the Oak Creek units, we remain committed to our aggressive environmental goals. Across our generating fleet, we're still targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030. And by the end of 2030, we expect to use coal only as a backup fuel and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of 2035. The capital investments we plan fully support this transition. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. And as you know, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy, engaging in policy discussions and on the ground, carrying out innovative projects that can drive decarbonization of the economy. For example, we've now finalized the test plans for blending hydrogen with natural gas at one of our modern gas field units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We've teamed up with the Electric Power Research Institute for this leading-edge project. The field work will take place this fall and the results will be shared across our industry. Separately, for our natural gas distribution business, we're making great progress in securing supplies of renewable natural gas. Scott will update us shortly but as a reminder, our plan is to achieve net zero methane emissions from our gas distribution networks by the end of 2030. Switching gears now. Let's take a brief look at the regional economy. The latest data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.9%, well, of course, below the national average and we continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region. For example, Gulfstream Aerospace is expanding its operations at the Appleton Airport. That's in Wisconsin's Fox Valley, southwest of Green Bay. The company is planning to build a world-class facility for painting and finishing aircraft exteriors. This expansion is expected to open in the third quarter of 2023 and it could add 200 new jobs to Gulfstream's existing workforce in Wisconsin. And just last month, Komatsu Mining celebrated the official grand opening of its new headquarters here in Milwaukee. The campus is already hosting about 600 employees. It includes offices, a training center and state-of-the-art manufacturing space to build heavy mining equipment. During the second quarter, groundbreaking also took place for a major expansion of the Georgia-Pacific paper mill in Green Bay. Georgia-Pacific is investing $500 million in its new facility which is expected to bring about 100 new jobs to the region. So with a wide range of developments in the pipeline, we remain very optimistic about the long-term future of the regional economy. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our utility operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, we're making good progress on our capital plan. Construction is underway on a number of regulated projects. We have started work on the reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units, at our western site in Northern Wisconsin. These units are expected to provide 128 megawatts in of dispatchable capacity with an estimated cost of $170 million. Also, work on our liquefied natural gas storage is underway. As you recall, the commission approved 2 LNG units in Southeastern Wisconsin. This $370 million investment will provide needed peaking capacity for our gas distribution business. On the renewable front, we've deployed $155 million towards refurbishing projects at 2 of our regulated wind farms. When completed, these projects will enhance reliability and performance at these farms. These investments will qualify those sites for production tax credits for an additional 10 years. Also, we expect our Red Barn Wind Park development in Southwestern Wisconsin to come online around the end of the year. It will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our Wisconsin Public Service customers. On the solar and battery front, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect these solar projects to go into service next year, supplying more clean energy to our Wisconsin customers. However, we've informed the Wisconsin Commission that the battery portion of the Paris project is expected to be delayed until 2024. As you may recall, we have filed for approval of 2 other solar battery projects, Darien and Koshkonong. We initially plan to add these to our fleet in 2023 and 2024. We now project them to enter service in 2024 and 2025, respectively. In addition, we now expect the retirement of Columbia Energy Center to take place in 2026. As you know, Alliant Energy operates the Columbia facility and we are a part owner. Of course, we\u2019ll keep you updated on any further developments. As you recall, we filed a rate review last quarter with the Public Service Commission for our Wisconsin utilities. Our proposed rate increase would support important capital investments and grid hardening projects. Recently, we provided an update to our filing. We factored in the extended operating lives of the older Oak Creek units and the Columbia units. This update also reflects other variables, including higher interest rates and costs associated with the completion of our solar projects. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023. We have no other rate reviews pending at this time. In our gas business, we\u2019ve discussed plans to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. The Wisconsin Commission recently approved our pilot project for this initiative. Just last month, we signed our third RNG contract which will connect our distribution system to a large dairy farm in Northeast Wisconsin. The 3 contracts in place are projected to bring us 80% of the way toward our goal of net zero methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flowing in our system by the end of this year. Outside of our utilities, our WEC infrastructure segment was once again a positive driver for the quarter. The Thunderhead Wind Farm located in Nebraska will be the next project to go into service scheduled for later this year. We also expect the Sapphire Sky Wind project in Illinois to come online by year-end. Together, the 2 projects represent approximately $800 million of investment, keeping us well ahead of our 5-year capital plan. As you know, MISO, the Midwest grid operator, has set out a long-range plan to address transmission needs across the Midwest. And last week, the MISO board approved the transmission projects for tranche 1. At this time, American Transmission Company estimates that its investment opportunity in tranche 1 is approximately $900 million. That\u2019s in today\u2019s dollars. Investment in these long-dated projects are expected to start as early as 2027. And with that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this ranks us in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and therefore, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. And today, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth at 6% to 7% a year. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our second quarter financials and she'll touch on the likely impact of the reconciliation bill that appears to be headed for a vote in the U.S. Senate. We view the legislation as broadly positive for customers, for the energy transition and for our future investment opportunities. Xia? Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Our 2022 second quarter earnings of $0.91 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations. The impact of weather was flat quarter-over-quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.30%, led by our small commercial and industrial customers. Overall, retail demand for electricity is tracking our forecast. Across our regulated business, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Rate-based growth contributed $0.09 to earnings. This is partially offset by $0.03 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.01 increase in day-to-day O&M. At our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.01 compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.04 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to stronger wind production across our portfolio as well as our Jayhawk Wind Farm that went in commercial operation at the end of last year. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and a gain last year on our investment in a clean energy fund that we recognized in the second quarter last year. Remember, rabbi trust is largely offset in O&M. Overall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $536 million. Cash earnings and a normal recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase. And total capital expenditures were $1 billion during the first half of 2022. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan. Before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to give a bit of color on the recently proposed Inflation Reduction Act. I'll also provide our guidance for the third quarter. We're still analyzing the details of the proposal. From what we understand now, we believe the proposal would provide additional benefits to our customers from investments in renewables. An option to choose production tax credits for solar projects and the ability to transfer tax credits would provide more flexibility for future renewable investments. This would apply both at our utilities and at the WEC Infrastructure segment. So overall, we see benefits to customers, future investment opportunities and stronger credit metrics. Now, let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We are expecting a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share. This accounts for weather and storm recovery costs in July and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.92 per share in the third quarter last year which included $0.05 of better-than-normal weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we\u2019re raising our full year guidance to a range of $4.36 to $4.40 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Let me just -- if we can touch on MISO policy for a second and maybe more specifically the generation backdrop following the PRA earlier this spring and kind of your own retirement modifications or, like you highlighted, delays. Just Gale, from your position, do you envision any structural changes to the auction in the coming years? And could we be in a position where we see WEC undertake maybe additional retirement extensions because of the supply-demand dynamic which could present maybe a possible O&M headwind? Or is this a definitive time line at this point? Gale Klappa : That's a great question, Shar. Based on everything we're seeing today, I don't sense that we're going to enter into any other significant extensions of plants. The dates we gave you, we feel pretty good about in terms of the retirement of the older Oak Creek units. And I think really what's going on here and MISO has said this, I think, fairly clearly, that there's been so much retirement up to date of older coal-fired units, that really they found themselves in a couple of regions in really, really tight capacity situations. Luckily, we've had the diverse supply here. We've been well prepared. We were basically unaffected by the big increase in capacity costs in the last auction but it was very prudent for us to make sure that we have that capacity online. And remember, Shar, these plants that we're extending, these older Oak Creek units, they're not projected to run a great deal. We need them for capacity purposes at high demand times and this protects our customers from continuing high auction costs in future capacity markets. But as we continue to bring the units online that Scott talked about, I think our current plan is likely to hold in terms of the retirement dates. I hope that answers your question. Shar Pourreza : No, it does. And I appreciate that. And then I think Xia kind of mentioned a little bit on sort of the IRA or the Inflation Reduction Act but there's obviously some linkages to your capital program and taxes as well. As you kind of work to finalize the roll forward this fall, could we see additional spend from the program, especially as we\u2019re heading into the conference, how do we think about that? And then there\u2019s obviously the counteractive force which is the minimum tax that will probably be beared by the customer, right? Gale Klappa : Yes. And we're working through all of that in our models. I will say this, right now, based on everything we're seeing and Xia can comment further. Based on everything we're seeing, some of the other benefits of that piece of legislation really kind of offset the minimum tax issues. So, we don\u2019t -- we actually think, as Xia mentioned and Xia, you might want to expand on this a little bit. It is likely there will be a credit positive or an FFO metric positive for us. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes, exactly. Like Gale mentioned, we see very manageable impact from AMT. I think in general, probably $20 million, $30 million of increase in cash tax payment. But like Gale mentioned, we see quite a bit of sources of credit metric benefits from either the monetization of tax credits or lower -- just offset by the lower debt balance, financing costs and so forth. So I think overall, if you take into consideration all the moving pieces, we actually see a benefit to the credit metrics. Gale Klappa : And a benefit also, Shar, one other, I think, point that we'll continue to emphasize, we talk about investment opportunities here, expanding with this piece of legislation, not only at the utilities but also at the Infrastructure segment. But one of the things that comes through clear to us, this is good for our customers. I mean this can help reduce the cost -- investment cost that our regulated customers have to cover. So there's some broad positives here, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Okay, got it. Got it. And then just real quick lastly, if I may. Just the rate case, the procedural schedule was obviously issued last week. You guys are great at settling. So as we're thinking about potential settlement options should we be looking at maybe the end of September, early October for that? Gale Klappa : Yes. It\u2019s hard to place an absolute time frame on the pace of settlement discussions. Right now, we\u2019re still pretty early in the process. The staff is continuing to -- we continue to interact with the staff on their data requests which are very normal and very good. So that part, the staff audit part which was kicked off by our filing, that\u2019s going smoothly, going well, going on time. And as you say, the administrative law judge in the case has proposed a schedule which I think the interveners would like a little more time in between some of the dates. So I\u2019m not sure the schedule is final but it\u2019s certainly close to final. And I would say steady as she goes. And just a reminder, I mean this case is very straightforward. It\u2019s really all about investment in grid hardening, investment in renewables, investment in reliability and over half of the capital projects in this case have already been approved and our O&M that we proposed is actually lower than what was approved in the last order. So the backdrop is still very positive. And right now, it\u2019s steady as she goes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just coming back to a couple of details here, if I can. Normalize for large C&I, just -- again, I get that, that doesn\u2019t move the needle as much on margin but obviously, through 6/30, there\u2019s a -- versus what you guys had forecasted on the year. You -- what you\u2019re seeing there? I know you highlighted a number of industrial trends at the outset here that bode well. But just are you expecting that to reverse in the second half? Or what\u2019s the set up there, if you can. Gale Klappa : Great question, Julien. And by the way, I got a question for you when I'm done answering. The small decrease that we saw in large C&I as we kind of -- and remember, we serve industrial customers in 17 different sectors of the economy. So it's a very broad gauge of what's going on. We saw 3 sectors in the first half and in the second quarter that really showed a bit of a decline : food processing, food and food processing. Some of that is related to one of our very large customers that is switching product lines. So they had an outage that's going to extend a little bit. And actually, I think they're going to make more chocolate which is a good thing, according to my wife. But anyway, so electronics, food processing and printing were the 3 categories that showed some decline. Primary metals was up but long story short, the rebound in small commercial customers -- the rebound in the commercial sectors of our economy was very strong and very good. So we'll see where industrial moves in the second half. We're not at all concerned about it. But clearly, what we're seeing is a very, very strong recovery in the commercial side of the business. I mean every commercial area we looked at is up from entertainment to hotels to restaurants to -- you name it. There's a really very active backdrop right now in the Wisconsin economy. So when you put it all together and take a look at it holistically, as Xia said, we feel like we're very much on track with our sales forecast for the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Nice. Okay, back half it is. Excellent. And before I answer your question, let me just [ squeeze ] in one more here. Xia, if I can put you on the spot a little bit here. Do you want to quantify a little bit as best even a range on what that credit metric, that net credit metric impact is? As well as if you this [ point beach ] method shift on, I think, $600 million of debt, give or take, if you can talk to that and how that might impact anything? Xia Liu : Sure. We really don't have a number yet because there's so many moving pieces, as you know, that qualification of production tax credit versus investment tax credit could change the dynamics among just the regulated businesses. So we really haven't quantified a number for you but more to come on that. On the -- you're talking about the supplemental filing that we made in Wisconsin related to a methodology change related to S&P. It's just the update -- the most -- they recently updated their methodology to calculate the imputed debt related to purchase power agreements. So we updated the calculation based on the new methodologies, nothing more than that. And they are applying the same methodologies across the industry. So we're not alone there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And presumably -- the recovery there, would you say? Xia Liu : Right. Gale Klappa : It's pretty formulaic, yes. It's a pretty standaround type of thing. Yes, yes. So Julien, I just want to check, how's your married life going? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It\u2019s going great. We bought a house, we\u2019re keeping going. Gale Klappa : All right, all right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Durgesh Chopra : Congratulations on yet another solid quarter. Just I wanted to sort of -- sorry, Xia but I\u2019m going to put you on the spot again and this is just knowing how well you know this topic. Just on the concept of this, the monetization of the tax credits and transferability. So obviously, this bill doesn\u2019t include direct pay which is part of the Build Back Better. How are you viewing that as an opportunity? Is transferability really sort of an opportunity for utilities like yourselves to monetize those credits? Or what might be those other options when you think about monetizing PTCs, ITCs, etcetera, etcetera? Xia Liu : Yes. I think that like I touched in the formal remarks, we see this overall bill with benefits for customers, for future investment opportunities and credit metrics. So in terms of the sources of customer benefits, obviously, PTCs versus ITCs from solar projects would be one. The flow-through of ITC benefits on stand-alone battery versus normalization could provide the customer benefit. You touched the marketing of tax credits. So that could be beneficial for customers, extension of tax credits. Those are the sources of customer benefits. And then, like Gale touched in terms of future investment opportunities, WEC, for example, right now, we're looking at the tax appetite to try to match our investment opportunities with our tax appetite. Obviously, with marketability of tax credits, that goes away. So that could open up for additional opportunities and we could potentially consider investment opportunities beyond wind. And then I touched already the credit metrics. So I think overall, I think we see this as a potential positive. Having said that, our current capital plan isn\u2019t relying -- built on any of these. So I think we would see some tailwind from this, this was passed. If not, we\u2019re just fine. Gale Klappa : Yes. I'd just like to add on to something Xia said. She's exactly right, the $17.7 billion 5-year capital plan that we've outlined for you doesn't envision any of these potential benefits. So that's why we think this is broadly positive. I would say just personally and this is just my own view, the idea of the transferability of tax credits, basically creating a market, I think, is actually a superior solution than direct pay, frankly. It's much simpler. It gets rid of -- we don't need tax equity but it gets rid of a tax equity structure that's complicated and time-consuming. I think this is actually a pretty ingenious approach in terms of the transferability of tax credits in the bill. I hope that helps. Durgesh Chopra : That helps tremendously. But just so I understand, Gale, am I right in thinking about this transferability as that you don\u2019t need ownership unlike tax equity where you actually need an ownership in the project, you don\u2019t need ownership as an investor or buyer of these tax credits. So essentially, the market or interest in these tax credits is going to be much larger than just those select banks or those specific tax equity investors. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Gale Klappa : Yes, I think you're right on. I think you're dead on, Durgesh. And in fact, a little bit of background. I know about some of the background of how this came to be in terms of discussions with Senator Manchin. And the idea that this really opens a much broader opportunity for these tax credits, not just with a tax equity investor, that was a major selling point, a major selling point, period, to all those who were crafting the bill. So I think you really analyzed it well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Gale Klappa : You survived your conference? Jeremy Tonet : I did. I did. Thank you for attending the fireside chat, it was great. Just want to come back to the coal retirements a little bit, if I could, as it relates to the Wisconsin rate case. And just what have reactions been so far? And do you see any potential implications on settlement talks from this? Gale Klappa : The short answer is -- I'm going to ask Scott to give you some detail but the short answer is we don't see any implications in terms of the rate case. And the reaction has been uniformly positive. Certainly, the Governor\u2019s office which we communicated well with prior to the announcement was very supportive. The staff at the Public Service Commission, obviously taking its responsibility to help ensure reliability was very positive. The industrial customers were positive. And overall, Scott, this really is not a big factor in changing the revenue requirement. Scott Lauber : No, not at all, Gale. And when we factored everything in, factoring and keeping these units running a little bit longer, extending those lives, factoring in the delay. And remember, we delayed these due to some supply chain challenges, building the solar and the batteries. Factoring those delays in, it was relatively revenue requirement neutral. And remember, for this particular case then, just in this case, you\u2019re avoiding those additional capacity costs. So it was well received adding that reliability until we can get these renewables built and some of the other capacity online. So it was well received across the board from my conversations with individuals across the board like Gale said. Gale Klappa : And in addition to that, Jeremy, we were able to reassure, as I mentioned in the script, we were able to reassure everyone that our commitment to really aggressive environmental improvement is unchanged by this action. So it just made a ton of sense both from a customer reliability and customer cost standpoint. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful there. And I just want to come back, if I could, to IRA and tax credits and what\u2019s possible there. You talked about the investment opportunity set for WEC Infrastructure being larger. I imagine it\u2019s larger than a breadbox but just wondering if you could give us any breadcrumbs as far as what the scale of opportunity might possibly be? Gale Klappa : At this point in time, Jeremy, it's probably too early to give you how much bigger than a breadbox answer but I will say this. Right now, our significant investments that we've made which as we reported to you, are performing very well in the Infrastructure segment, those have all been wind projects. I think we have 8 wind projects that were committed to and some of them operating already, a number of them operating already. What this does do and Xia pointed to it which is giving companies like ours the option of production tax credits for solar. That could open up an entire avenue of investment in the infrastructure segment for solar simply because of the way the economics work today. So that just gives you an idea. They\u2019re all wind right now in the infrastructure segment. We continue to see opportunities with wind but it could also open up a whole different technology investment with solar. Xia Liu : I will add, though, we have the 10% total investment as a portfolio from [ WEC ] so we don't see that change even with this bill passing. Gale Klappa : Yes, that\u2019s a good point. We\u2019re -- but the opportunity continues because our regulated business is growing as well. So -- but yes, we intend to keep the Infrastructure segment at around 10% of earnings going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Michael Sullivan : I wanted to start with the -- I know it\u2019s a shoulder quarter for the gas business but sales trends remain pretty strong there, looking at the first half of the year. Really, really strong. I guess, any color on what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable you think that is? Gale Klappa : So your question is how strong is it, right? Actually, it's -- you're asking an interesting question. The other day, as we were reviewing all of the data, we were asking ourselves, this is really interesting, what are we seeing here? What are the trends? And two answers and Scott and Xia should add their viewpoint but two answers. One is and you've heard me say this a gazillion times, weather normalization is more precise than accurate. So I'm not sure that our weather normalization techniques picked up all of the weather impact that we saw, particularly in Q2. April started out as an abnormally cold month in Wisconsin. And I think that drove some sales and perhaps our weather normalization techniques didn't quite pick up that fully. But the other thing that we're seeing and this is not surprising but positive, a big chunk of the increase that we're seeing and it is a strong increase, is in industrial processes for gas. When you look at the segments of our gas customers, actually, the biggest increase in Q2 is coming from industrial process used for gas. And again, that reflects back on the strength of the economy and we see that as pretty positive. So, I hope that's helpful. It has been a very strong 6 months, no question about that. We'll see what continues here. But the biggest driver in Q2 in terms of the increase we saw was a cold April where residential customers use more gas. And throughout the quarter, the increased use of gas by our large industrial customers for process purposes. Michael Sullivan : Okay, very helpful. And then in terms of the pending renewables projects on the regulated side of the business that you\u2019re building. I think there\u2019s been like a little bit of a cost pickup on some of the nearer-term stuff, whereas the longer term has been pretty steady thus far. Is -- are those numbers still good? Or do you think there\u2019s ultimately going to be some upward pressure there as well? Gale Klappa : We'll let Scott give you his view on this. I will say this, the nearer-term cost changes, we fully anticipated and had communicated with our regulatory folks. Scott? Scott Lauber : So we anticipated and talked to them about it. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone when we file the incremental increases. And what we've been saying is we're going to see cost increases in that 20% to 30%. In fact, the last filing on the solar, the first project we came in were about $1,300 a kW -- kilowatt. And then now it's about $1,540. I think the last one is about $1,640. So they're moving up a little bit, still in line with what we're seeing across the country. In the future, we'll have to see where things go but we said it could be 30% to 40%. But once again, there's a lot of supply chain here and you're looking multiple years out. So right now, there the cost we did see go up but really in line, in fact, a little bit lower than what we see across the country. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And last one real quick. Any plans to file a people\u2019s gas case anytime soon? Gale Klappa : No time soon. No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : How is it going, Gale? I hope all as well. Gale Klappa : Same here. Anthony Crowdell : Married life is going well for me also, if you've just been checking. But hopefully -- just in case my wife sees someone in EEI, I don't want any problems. Hopefully, two easy questions. One is, I guess, guiding to 6% to 7% in one of the slide decks, I think, from the July presentation, historically, it\u2019s been 9% CAGR. There\u2019s really -- you highlighted between GAAP and non-GAAP which there\u2019s no difference. I\u2019m just curious with all that tailwind that you\u2019ve mentioned on the previous questions, what has to happen for you to hit the 6% number? Gale Klappa : What has to happen for us to hit a 6% growth trajectory? Anthony Crowdell : Yes. Gale Klappa : Downsides that I really don't anticipate that would be kind of out of the blue right now. Remember, our projection is 6% to 7%. And certainly, what we have in the pipeline in terms of approved capital investments and simply our continued efficiency and driving best practices through our operations. It would take something that I don't anticipate. Scott? Scott Lauber : No, I agree, Gale. We have really good value-added customer projects we\u2019re putting in. When you think about like grid hardening. The storms that we\u2019ve seen this summer and last summer, it makes a lot of sense to go as we do that, the additional transition to renewables. So we feel really comfortable with where we are to be able to execute. It\u2019s a very executable capital plan also. Gale Klappa : With no need for equity. Scott Lauber : Exactly. So -- but we will continue to evaluate our growth. And as we look at the fall and we pull into the capital projects, we\u2019ll continue to look at it. Gale Klappa : And Anthony, when I see your wife at EEI, I'll just say, what goes on in Boston stays in Boston. How's that? Anthony Crowdell : I appreciate that. I appreciate that. If I look at on the cost side, so far, first half of the year, O&M is down 4% roughly when I look at the slides you put out. What is the more challenging part of maintaining the cost in O&M in this inflationary environment? What are you seeing as the biggest challenge? What part of your O&M budget? Gale Klappa : Well, I can give you an initial thought on that. Well, certainly, Scott and Xia are very close to the numbers as well. So we'll ask for their view. I would say the -- when you think about our own -- I mean the first thing that comes to mind actually may not be the biggest cost factor in our array of costs that we have to operate the enterprise day-to-day. But you just think about the gasoline that our fleet, our trucks, our service trucks, our bucket trucks. When you think about the cost of gasoline having more than doubled, that\u2019s certainly a big factor and we got -- we are rolling as few trucks as possible. But when you have a storm, you got to roll trucks. When you have an outage, you got to roll trucks. That\u2019s one big factor that has been largely out of our control. And I would just point to that one first. Scott, Xia? Scott Lauber : No, you're exactly right, Gale. You really have to kind of pull yourself behind the numbers here. And when you look at the O&M, just to correct where we're at here, some of those decreases that we're seeing on the top level of the income statement are some of the items that we had in our rate review last year for transmission. There's a little detailed breakdown on a few additional pages in our packet. So some of that is related to transmission reductions that we agreed to. So Wisconsin actually was up a little bit year-to-date. So that\u2019s because it\u2019s reaction to storms and some of these inflationary pressures that Gale talks to. But overall, when we look at our forecast, we\u2019re still projecting to be down about 1% flat to 1% in total O&M. - Gale Klappa : Xia, anything you\u2019d like to add? Xia Liu : No, I think you covered it very well. Gale Klappa : Okay. Terrific. Anthony, I hope that's responsive to your question. Anthony Crowdell : Perfect. NFL schedule is out and I think my Jets may finally win one in Green Bay in October. Gale Klappa : Yes. I'll take the over under on that one for you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Sophie. How are you doing today? Sophie Karp : I am doing great. Great discussion so far. Just if I may press you a little bit more on this -- on the IRA provisions, right? There\u2019s more there than just wind in store. We have basically a lot of incentives for Evs, for technology-agnostic PTCs at some point, right? How do you think about maybe moving beyond wind and solar and the branching out to other areas, right? Could you do, for example, modular nuclear? Or have you looked into fleet electrification opportunities like some of your peers are doing? Your own fleet, you mentioned gasoline prices or maybe municipal fleet, etcetera. If you could just elaborate on what is beyond, I guess, wind and solar. Gale Klappa : Yes, happy to. And of course and Xia mentioned this as well but batteries is a -- the battery inclusion in this act is also important in terms of the credits. So batteries, certainly and that's in our plan already and probably will be even more greatly in our plan going forward. So batteries is one area that can be beneficial to all of us given what's in this piece of legislation. We do have and we probably don\u2019t talk about it enough but we do have goals for electrification of our fleet. No doubt about that. So that\u2019s coming. We have now a pilot program in place in Wisconsin that the Wisconsin Commission approved a few months ago where we are approaching commercial and some residential customers about installing individual chargers at their locations where we would own the asset and that is off to a really good start. So those two things come to mind immediately. As far as small modular reactors, I mean, we\u2019re tracking the progress. No question about that. Our strategy folks on the generation side of the business who have had regular contact with the developers of SMR. I will say this, we are not in the business of serial number one. But certainly, down the road, particularly if this kind of tax credits apply, that certainly could be an option down the road, not in our 5-year plan, probably not in the next 5-year plan but certainly down the road. Xia, anything you\u2019d like to add? Xia Liu : No, I think the only thing is we are going through the hydrogen test process to learn more on that. And as part of this IRA, there's new clean hydrogen production credit. So that's something that if it indeed is making sense, that would be something we would be happy to look into. Gale Klappa : A very good point. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. And I think the other point, you mentioned EVs. And we really see it more as not that but the adoption of EVs, how does that even expand our grid hardening as more and more EVs come onto the system. And like Gale said, we've got a robust program already, we see a lot of traction. But remember, we didn't put any of this in our future 5-year forecast that we talked about it in our third quarter call. So we have nothing in our long-term plans related to EV. So adoption there could be a nice little tailwind there for some sales. Gale Klappa : Yes. And Sophie, you probably heard our rule of thumb that for every 2 new EVs put onto our system, it\u2019s probably the equivalent, the energy equivalent of a single household. So when you think about -- and we just saw some statistics the other day from the State of Wisconsin projecting the trajectory of EV adoption in the state, if it\u2019s even close to right, Scott\u2019s point will be borne out in really, really fully because, I mean, we only have a few thousand, a couple of thousand EVs in the state today. And they\u2019re projecting just huge numbers by 2030. We\u2019ll see if that\u2019s right. But behind that would have to be a very significant investment particularly with our rule of thumb estimate about 2 new EVs on our system equal to the energy demand of a single household. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : I have an easy one for you. Actually, I have two questions that I\u2019ll do sequentially. The first one and it follows on the EV question that just came. Can you talk about what you think is the long-term role of the utility, the electric utility is and the potential ownership of charging stations relative to kind of the various market models we have today in this country where the utility is generally not the owner of charging stations or is a very small component of that. How do you just think about that from a public policy standpoint? Gale Klappa : Well, that's a great question, Michael. I would say this. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all answer. I think you've hit on it earlier, there's a lot of different models floating around the country, state by state, even the federal government now with the charging plan. So we're very, as you know, very, very early in the development of the whole infrastructure that would support a massive transition to electric vehicles. So I think the jury is still out and time will tell in terms of just -- in terms of how much of the actual charging equipment that utilities will own. But -- and so I really can't -- I don't think anybody can give you a really clear answer on that question today. I will say this though, when you think about and it goes back to Scott's comment on grid hardening. If you think about neighborhood, let's say, a cul-de-sac with, I don't know, 8 homes, for example. If 2 or 3 of those homes adopt EVs, well, we're going to have to put in a much larger transformer in that neighborhood. So there are incredible investment requirements in terms of our basic infrastructure. Forget the charging equipment itself for a moment. There are various significant investment needs that are going to come with the adoption of EVs. And that, I think, will open up again tremendous capital opportunity for a company like ours but also the need to be able to have the grid that really supports that kind of transition to a massive, massive number of EVs. So again, none of that's in our forecast. We will wait and see how we -- how the EV adoption moves forward. But I can tell you it's beginning to gain momentum here in Wisconsin. I don't think there's any question about that. So, I hope that answers your question to some extent. I just don't think there's a good single answer about who owns what to what extent going forward. There are just too many models and too much discussion and development right now to give you a much more specific response. Michael Lapides : No, totally understand. And then my second question is another kind of policy one which is when you go meet -- you and the team go meet with Governor Evers or go meet with folks in the state legislature or some of the leaders of some of the large business groups. What is it that the utilities in the state are not doing today or have in their next 1-year or 2-year or 3-year plans that they still like to see you guys do? Gale Klappa : That we would still like to see or that Governor Evers would like to see? Michael Lapides : That the governor and other both elected officials and business leaders. Gale Klappa : It all comes down to -- it all comes down to one word, reliability. Affordability, yes but reliability is the key. I mean, whenever we have discussions with legislative people when -- with the public service commissioners, with the governor's office, it is really all revolving around reliability. They want to make sure that what happened in Texas does not happen here. And that we're going to have the capability to continue to support the energy transition. Scott? Scott Lauber : It\u2019s reliability, not only on electric but also on natural gas, keeping the houses warm here in this cold environment in Wisconsin. So that\u2019s also a key. So we just don\u2019t want to look at it from one side. Gale Klappa : Which again led to us talking with them and making the decision to briefly extend the lives of the older Oak Creek units. Again, it was all about assuring reliability. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then finally, with the changes in the time in -- the in-service dates for the storage and solar projects, how should we think about what this does to the CapEx forecast for the next 2 to 3 years? Gale Klappa : Very little. It might shift from year to year but I mean, we have so much flexibility in that capital budget that, Scott, I don't see any major impact. Scott Lauber : No, I don\u2019t. We\u2019re really looking at the numbers but every year, there\u2019s a few things that we have to move around a little bit. So it\u2019s not going to be a substantial change as we flow through our next iteration here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : A couple of quick ones on coal first. So first, in terms of the O&M impact between delays to solar coming on solar and battery and the decision to move some retirement dates around -- you\u2019ve talked about the benefits of nonfuel O&M savings in the future. What does that impact look like as you think about these fundamentally changing from operating as baseload units to becoming capacity resources that won\u2019t run very often? Gale Klappa : Well, I think we basically said there'd be about a $10 million uptick in the O&M to use these older Oak Creek units as capacity machines offset by the other factors that Scott mentioned. Scott? Scott Lauber : Right. So that's as you look at it as compared to what we had in the rate case here. But when you think of ongoing, when you go back a couple of years, when they were really full-on baseload plants, probably the O&Ms come down maybe $10 million when you think about it overall, so we're still trying to -- about $10 million. Still looking at the efficiencies, you're not running them quite as much. You can utilize the staff and a variety of projects, trying to make the workforce as efficient as possible. So -- but it's a lot cheaper than going out and buying that capacity in the market. Andrew Weisel : Right, that makes sense. Okay. And then how will that transition look for the coal units? Will they gradually decrease their capacity factors over a few months or seasons? Or will it flip like a switch on a predetermined day that all of a sudden, they're only for back up now? Gale Klappa : No, it all depends -- I mean, as you know, in the MISO market, we basically let the Midwest grid operator know what units we have available and at what marginal cost all the time. I mean day ahead, hour ahead, etcetera. So those units will run based on efficiency and demand in the MISO market. But we anticipate, just looking at our modelling, we anticipate they will be used really seasonally at the highest demand times, winter and summer, probably not online very much during the non-higher demand time, Scott? Scott Lauber : No, that's exactly right. And it's not going to be a switch. We'll continue to look at the forecast and do the strategy as we do every other type of asset. Andrew Weisel : Okay. But dispatch is ultimately determined by MISO, right? Gale Klappa : Yes, absolutely. Yes, just like every other unit. So basically, this just becomes an asset in our portfolio that we offer to MISO every day. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Then one separate question. If I can attack the O&M question from a different perspective. Given the strength of the year-to-date results, are you thinking about or have you started pulling forward expenses from \u201823 and beyond to better position yourself? I know you\u2019re in the midst of a rate case and you talked about pressures from inflation, from storms. Just wondering how to think about those puts and takes. Gale Klappa : Well, the short answer is we have had, particularly in July, we've had some pretty serious storms, so we've had some additional operating costs in July that you're not seeing in our numbers yet, obviously. And we have a number of maintenance projects already scheduled in our normal plan for the second half of the year. Power plant maintenance, other maintenance. So we're not planning on pulling forward any additional O&M because we've got plenty of things to do in our normal plan. Xia? Xia Liu : I think that\u2019s exactly right. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : So just last but not least, hopefully but good talking to you. So just to follow up on the coal plant thing. What I\u2019m a little bit confused by is the impact of the supply chain issues. At least from what I\u2019ve been reading in the local press, it seems like that\u2019s associated with renewables. And I\u2019m just trying to understand what projects that were delayed? I mean is it storage? Or is it transmission components? Or is it -- I\u2019m just wondering how -- what actually caused, I guess, the pushback on the plant retirements? Gale Klappa : That's a great question. And to clarify, there are really two elements to it and we'll let Scott cover the details. But the first is one of the major solar battery park investments that we are making have already been approved which is what we call the Paris Battery Solar Park. The batteries there are going to be delayed. So that's a piece of it. And then I think, Scott, you mentioned during the prepared script, there are 2 solar projects that we are now going through the regulatory process on and they\u2019re not going to come in on the original dates. Scott Lauber : Correct. They're not going to come in. So we had several solar projects and those additional solar projects also had batteries attached to them. And with that uncertainty in the capacity, it just did not make sense to pull the trigger on those retirements. Gale Klappa : Paul, just to kind of put all that in perspective. We're going to be running those older Oak Creek units over the next couple of years here as we extend their lives just a little bit, we're going to be running them as capacity machines. The solar that we were putting in on the batteries were also for capacity. So that's really the trade-off we're making here. Paul Patterson : Got it. And then we\u2019re seeing around different parts of the country, sort of constraints. Transmission constraints impacting wind production. I\u2019m wondering, are you seeing any of that in Wisconsin or anywhere else that you guys -- that you guys are associated with? Are you seeing any impact on curtailment of wind production? Gale Klappa : So far in Wisconsin, very little. However, in our Infrastructure segment, we've seen some lengthy transmission maintenance outages in the Dakotas, for example. We've seen some transmission issues that seem to now be resolved in Kansas with our Jayhawk wind farm. So sporadically, yes, we have seen some transmission issues and there's no question that we have got to, as a nation, move forward with transmission projects. We've just got to do it to maintain reliability of the grid without a doubt. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re pleased that MISO has gotten to the point where they\u2019ve gotten to and you probably heard Scott, actually, it\u2019s $100 million higher than we thought originally. So the MISO tranche 1 for American Transmission Company is now up to a $900 million investment. All right, sports fans. Well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating. Always enjoy talking with you. If you have any more questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka. She can be reached at (414) 221 4639. Thanks, everybody, so long. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be made available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Please go ahead. Gale Klappa : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 earnings of $0.96 a share. The major factors shaped another solid quarter. Strong performance from our Infrastructure segment, an uptick from our ownership in American Transmission Company, plus a warm close to the summer in September. Of course, our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and stable. And I will switch gears and provide you with some background on the Wisconsin rate settlements that we announced in October. As you recall, we filed rate reviews earlier this year with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for all our Wisconsin utilities. After the commission staff completed its analysis, we reached agreements with multiple parties, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. In fact, more parties supported these settlements than any other settlement we've reached over the years. Scott will provide you with more detail on the terms in just a moment, but I would simply say that we view this as a very positive step forward. The process, it's now in the home stretch, and we look forward to the commission's review, which we expect in December. Our other big news for the day Xia Liu, is the rollout of our ESG progress plan for the period 2023 through 2027. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $2.1 billion with an ongoing focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $2.4 billion. That's more than 13.5% above our previous 5-year plan. Now as we look forward, I will describe our growth trajectory as long and strong. In fact, our plan will now support compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the next 5 years without any need to issue equity. And as you've come to expect from us, this projected earnings growth will be of very high quality. Highlights of the plan include a significant increase in renewable energy projects for our regulated utilities from roughly 2,400 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 3,300 megawatts in this plan. And as we continue to decarbonize our system, it's important to point out that passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is a real true game changer for customer affordability. We now project long-term customer savings of nearly $2 billion of our investment in renewables in this 5-year plan. That's nearly double of what we projected just a year ago. We've also dedicated more capital to hardening our networks, our electric distribution networks so that we can deliver a high level of reliability for our customers. And we've included in the new ESG progress plan an increase in transmission investment. Two major factors are driving this growth. Renewable projects that require transmission and the long-range planning process being conducted by MISO, the Midwest grid operator. Add it all up, shake it all around, and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan. The projects that are driving our growth are low risk and highly executable. They're paving the way for greater sustainability, paving the way for an energy future that's affordable, reliable and clean. And now before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to cover a significant development in our infrastructure segment. Just yesterday, you may have seen the news that we will acquire an 80% interest in the Maple Flats Solar Energy Center. That's a 250-megawatt project being developed by Invenergy in South Central Illinois. We plan to invest approximately $360 million for 80% ownership of the project. Maple Flats has an offtake agreement with a Fortune 100 company for the sale of all of the energy it will produce. And under the Inflation Reduction Act, Maple Flats will qualify for production tax credits. The project, of course, meets all our financial criteria and will further diversify the renewable assets in the infrastructure segment of our business. renewables in this And finally, a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 14,400 private sector jobs in September, and the unemployment rate in the state stands at 3.2%. That's well below the national average. We continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region and a wide range of developments is in the pipeline, so I would just say watch this space. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our investor segment. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by reviewing where we stand on the regulatory front. First, let's get back to the details in the rate review. Pending commission approval, a partial settlement agreements would bring several other changes beyond the base rates. We've agreed to a common equity component of 53% and for each of our Wisconsin utilities, consistent with our initial request. The settlement calls for the continuation of the revenue sharing mechanism that has been in place this year. The agreement also addresses the future cost recovery of the older units of our Oak Creek power plant. First, we've agreed to securitize $100 million of the book value of the plant's environmental controls. Second, after retirement, we would propose to levelize over 25 years, recovery of the remaining book value, which is approximately $400 million. We agree with the settling parties that the commission should determine the return on equity for each utility, along with the allocation of revenue among customer classes. We expect the commission review by mid-December. In addition, today, we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources. We are seeking an overall bill increase of 7.9%, primarily driven by capital investments. We expect interim rates will go into effect January 1. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. In Wisconsin, work continues on our new reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units, as well as our liquefied natural gas storage facilities.  As we've discussed, these projects are needed to support the reliability of our electric and natural gas systems. And our red barn wind development continues to move forward in Southwestern Wisconsin. We now expect to come online early next year with an investment of $160 million, this project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system. Work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect these projects to go into service next year, with the battery storage anticipated in 2024. Of beyond the base course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. We're continuing to make strides in support of a low and no carbon generation. Just last month, we completed our pilot project, blending hydrogen and natural gas at one of our modern RICE units in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. This is a first-in-the-world test of its kind using this technology. As you'll recall, we partnered with the Electric Power Research Institute to lead this research. The project mixed hydrogen and natural gas in a 25% to 75% blend. We are still evaluating the data. However, our initial findings indicate that all project measures met or exceeded our expectations. The units performed very well and efficiently. As expected, nitrogen oxide emissions increased our equipment was able to take these emissions out and, of course, carbon-dioxide emissions were reduced. Our research will help demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for potential generation on a larger scale in the future. We look forward to sharing the full results with our industry and the public early next year. And as we've discussed, we've been able and working on to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. Just last month, we signed our fourth RNG contract contributing to our goal of net 0 methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flow in our system by early next year. Outside our utilities, we continue making good progress on projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. I'm pleased to report we've completed the acquisition of the Thunderhead Wind Farm and expected to enter commercial operations later this year. and we expect Sapphire Sky Wind to go into service early next year. Together, the 2 projects represent approximately $800 million of investment. And as Gale noted, we're excited to add our first solar project to this segment with Maple Flats. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. And as we head now into the final months of the year, we're narrowing our earnings guidance to a range of $4.38 to $4.40 a share, and we expect to reach the top end of that range. And a quick reminder about our dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're positioned very well within that range, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our third quarter financials. Xia, all yours. Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Our 2022 3rd quarter earnings of $0.96 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations. Overall, earnings across our regulated businesses were down $0.03 when compared to the third quarter of 2021. While weather was favorable relative to normal, it negatively impacted earnings by an estimated $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter. Outside of weather, earnings from our utility operations were yours. flat quarter-over-quarter. Rate base growth contributed $0.09 to earnings. This was fully offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, an increase in day-to-day O&M and the timing of fuel expense and other items. In terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.3%. Sales to our large commercial and industrial customers grew 2.1% compared to last Q3. Overall, retail demand for electricity is tracking our forecast. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased to $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2021. Higher earnings were mostly related to the resolution of historical appeals returning to the ROE used by MISO transmission owners. As of the third quarter and going forward, we're recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits from our Jayhawk Wind Farm that began commercial operation at the end of last year. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment were flat quarter-over-quarter. Overall, we improved on our third quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $53 million. Recovery of natural gas costs drove this increase. And total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of 2022, a $316 million increase as compared with the first 9 months of 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan. Looking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plan to invest $20.1 billion over the next 5 years in key infrastructure. This ESG progress plan supports 7.4% annual growth in our asset base. Pages 18, 19 and 20 of the earnings package provide a breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here. As we continue to make our energy transition over 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $7.3 billion in renewable projects and another $7.3 billion in grid and fleet reliability. Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to electric and gas infrastructure to support customer growth. We also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and modernization of our systems to further generate long-term operating efficiency. This robust capital plan supports a higher and narrowed EPS growth rate of 6.5% to 7% over the long term. As always, we're using the midpoint of this year's original guidance as our base. To remind you, that number is $4.31 a share. With our strong economic development backdrop and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead, even beyond the next 5 years. As Gale said before, this trajectory is long and strong. In closing, I'd like to provide our earnings guidance. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.73 to $0.75 per share. As a reminder, we earned $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter last year. Also, let me reiterate our guidance for 2022. As Gale noted, the new range is $4.38 to $4.40 per share. Our expectation is that we'll reach the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. And overall, folks, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Just getting ready for EEI. So Gale, just a couple of questions here. So your initial look at the 5-year capital plan shows pretty consistent spending at the infrastructure, but a large jump on Wisconsin on the generation side. As we're sort of thinking about the drivers of the increase, is it more on the IRA-related side? And if so, are you assuming more RFP wins, less reliance on tax equity, more regulated acquisitions. I guess, what's driving this jump? And what's the mix between solar, wind and storage? Gale Klappa : Okay. Great question, Shar, as always, and take your vitamins before EEI. Let me try to break that down into several pieces. The first is, as you recall, because of our particular situation with our tax appetite, we never had the need for tax equity. So just set that aside, that was never in our capital plan. And then secondly, in terms of what are the big drivers of the increase from $17.7 billion to $20 billion, really, there are 3, as I kind of mentioned in the script. But the first is continued decarbonization of our electric system in Wisconsin, the retirement of older coal-fired power plants in the future and the need to have carbon-free generation to support the capacity needs of the state. Xia can give you the breakdown of the renewable projects that we're laying out in the 5-year plan between wind and solar and battery storage. But long story short, it's a continuation of the decarbonization of the system and very much enhanced in terms of customer affordability by the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act. Clearly, the Inflation Reduction Act with the huge customer benefits that I mentioned over the long term are really a factor in helping with Bill headroom as we continue again to decarbonize the economy. So that's one big chunk. And as I mentioned, we're going from -- in the previous 5-year plan, about 2,400 megawatts of renewables for our regulated customers to about 3,300 megawatts in this particular plan. The second piece plan, but also as more renewables get completed in the online in Wisconsin, there is a need for upgraded transmission. And in addition to that, some of the transmission system here is of an age where it's going to need to be rebuilt. So we're seeing a big uptick in transmission investment needs. And then the third is, we had outlined a while back, a $700 million plan to harden our electric distribution network, and that will continue. So I hope that responds to your question. Xia, do you want to give a quick breakdown of the 3,300 megawatts in terms of wind and solar and batteries? Xia Liu : Yes, I'd be happy to. So we assumed about 1,900 megawatts of solar. So that's a little over 440 megawatts increase compared to the last plan. We assumed around 670 megawatts of wind and 720 megawatts of battery. So that adds up to about 3,300. So I'm giving you some round numbers. So higher solar, higher wind, slightly lower battery compared to the prior plan. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just a detailed breakout when you provided EEI, should we just expect a step-up in generation spending will be more back-end loaded? Or will it be an increase across the period? I guess how do we layer this in as we're thinking about your updated growth guide? Gale Klappa : Well, great question, Shar. As you know, we've got a number of renewable projects in flight right now. So I think this is not a back-end loading kind of a thing. It's pretty pro rata across the 5 years. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then, Gale, lastly is just on -- as we're thinking about the Infrastructure segment, historically, it's been ahead of your planning budget. But we could see some softness there, especially as many of the regulated peers it competes with in other states are now obviously more competitive post IRA. First, I guess, do you agree with that? And then what are your thoughts on essentially all of your peers kind of exiting these nonutility businesses and what seems to be a fairly healthy transaction multiples? Gale Klappa : Shar, I always respect your opinion, but in terms of future softness in our Infrastructure segment we just don't see it. we honestly don't see it. And I think a good example of that is, I mean, coming out of the gate on the Inflation Reduction Act, and we mentioned to you and others that the inflation Reduction Act by allowing a choice for solar projects between investment tax credits and production tax credits that choice could open up a whole lane of additional investment for us in the infrastructure segment and, shazam, it did with our announcement of Maple Flats. But honestly, we don't see for our company, a softness there. And you're right, some other companies have decided to have decided to exit that business. But to be honest with you, I think a lot of that with very good transaction multiples, obviously, but a lot of that is to avoid equity. A lot of that is to avoid dilution. We're not in that position. And so we think it's a very good business for us. It's meeting all of our financial criteria. But I would just add one thing that I think is really important and that we probably don't emphasize enough. We're building flexibility here. Post 2030, when a number of the contracts that are in place for these infrastructure segment renewables, when they roll off, we're going to have the potential to roll some of these projects at a very good price into our regulated asset base. So we're building carbon-free flexibility for the future in carbon-free capacity for the future. We'll have a lot of options with these assets. And frankly, given the multiples we're seeing, they're probably worth a lot more than we are seeing in our own value. Operator : The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : So a couple of questions for you. Let me just start off where she left off a little bit. I mean as you think about the extent of the IRA opportunities, obviously, you guys increased the regulated utility outlook to 3.3 from 2.4. but is that the full extent of it? I mean can we expect a little bit more? And then related to that, as you look at the higher rate environment today, you talk about meeting the financial criteria with the solar investment here, I mean, what kind of ROEs and IRRs are you seeing out there, should we calibrate recalibrate ourselves in this elevated rate environment out there? Or is that still a little bit TBD on this project and kind of the go forward [indiscernible] Investments? Gale Klappa : No. To answer your second question, and I'm going to have Scott to give you his thoughts as well on the -- particularly on the trajectory of additional renewables beyond our 5-year plan in Wisconsin, which I think is robust. But long story short, back to your question on the IRRs on our infrastructure projects. I mentioned this particular project, $360 million solar facility in Southern Illinois, this meets all of our financial criteria. So roughly 8% levered IRR. And again, returns that exceed the returns in our regulated business. And, as I mentioned, give us tremendous flexibility in the 12 to 15 years ahead of us. So at the moment -- and again, we can be very, very selective with these projects. We have 8 wind farms that are either in operation or we've committed to and now the solar facility. But we are, again, by being selective, by working with great partners like Invenergy I think we've got a really solid future. And I don't see at the moment the kind of softness that perhaps some of the others are seeing, but it may be because we can be particularly selective. Scott? Scott Lauber : No, you're exactly right. A lot of opportunities, as you saw, we just announced that Maple Flat solar project. As you think about the long term and the benefits of the IRA, as Gale mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have over the 20 years, over $2 billion of customer savings for the projects that we've announced that goes through 2027. I think there's a lot more opportunities as you look at the last half of the decade here. So probably more to come, a lot of good savings. And when we look at that $2 billion of savings for our customers, it factors in the IRA and we think a very conservative only $4 gas cost. So the benefits are even more as we look at more renewables as we see $5, $6, $7 gas cost. So a lot of opportunities here. I hope that's helpful. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Absolutely. Absolutely. Excellent. And then if I may here, just pivoting back to the Illinois side of the equation or more focused on people's gas in Chicago. Any updated regulatory strategy there following the expiration of the existing pipe replacement rider at the end of next year? Gale Klappa : No. As you mentioned, the pipe replacement rider which we call the QIP, the qualified investment plan, rider by legislation is set to expire at the end of 2023. So we are still in the process of evaluating what's appropriate -- and certainly, with the election well underway in just a few days away, practically, we need to wait to after the election to really have the appropriate conversations with the right folks. The only thing I will say is the work needs to continue whether it's through a rider or whether it's through a rate case with a forward-looking test period, the work needs to continue. And as you remember, the long Commerce Commission asked us to have an independent engineering study done more than 80% in that study, which was extensive, and it took over a year to complete by an independent engineering firm. That firm found that more than 80% of the remaining pipes under the city of Chicago have a useful life left of less than 15 years. So the work must go on, we're on target with it, and we'll just continue to work in the process as we move into next year. Operator : The next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Rich Sunderland : It's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Thinking about the narrowed growth rate here. Curious on a couple of different considerations. One is you walk from the greater than 7% asset-based growth, I know you typically outline parent financing cost is the delta down to the growth rate. But that's ticked up at the high end of the EPS growth remaining 7%. Any thoughts around the considerations to moving that higher than 7%? Or what else we might not be thinking of in terms of offsets from asset-based EPS? Gale Klappa : Well, it kind of starts -- well, first of all, as you know, our new 6.5% to 7% growth rate is probably the tightest projected growth rate in the industry. And I think that's a reflection of our ability to execute, our ability to build projects on time and on budget, our track record of consistency. So I see the narrow growth rate as, again, very, very strong and our confidence of our ability to deliver. In terms of the actual math, you start with -- as you know, you start with what is the average growth rate in the asset base, and that is 7.4% a year. And then we back -- we have no need for equity, which I think is a particularly distinguishing factor for us in the industry. But we have to back off financing costs, not just at the parent, but also debt costs at the individual utilities and at the infrastructure segment. So you put it all together and with our -- what I think is our conservative interest rate assumptions, it gets you to that 6.5% to 7% growth rate. Xia, anything you'd like to add to that? Xia Liu : No, I think you covered it, Gale. Gale Klappa : I hope that helps to respond to your question. Rich Sunderland : No, that's very helpful. And maybe just picking up the last thread there on the financing side. where do you see FFO to debt standing currently and maybe through this plan period as well, especially consideration of the higher CapEx here? Gale Klappa : Yes. Xia has got the detail for you. Xia Liu : Yes. We are still -- remember, I talked about it in the last quarter earnings call that the IRA provides balance sheet flexibility from several fronts, the PTCs for solar, the stand-alone ITC for battery investment and also the transferability. So all those things provide more flexibility for us. So basically, the financial plan accommodates 2 things. One is IRA, 2 is higher interest rates and also the higher capital, and we're still looking at the target FFO to debt over the longer term. And by the way, the higher interest rates are already factored in the Wisconsin settlement, as you probably already knew. Operator : The next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just I wanted to quickly follow up. I just wanted to kind of get a sense of what's included in the current rate settlement and then what should we -- how should we think about regulatory approvals in terms of time line and sort of key dates for us to watch as you execute on that 3.3 gigawatt portfolio that you just articulated? Gale Klappa : Xia has got the full breakdown. I can tell you, though, a pretty significant percentage of the 3.3 gigawatts is already in flight. But we have a number of them coming, and Xia has got the breakdown for you. Xia Liu : Yes. So out of the 3300, the amount that we will file in the future is about 2,100. So that gives you a sense that over 1,200 megawatts are already either under development or we have already filed and we'll address those in the [indiscernible] test year '23 and also we have a limited reopener in '24. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So 1,200 already underway and then 2,100, what's the timing of those? Are those like -- you said reopener '24. So are those like '25 and beyond type sort of approvals? Xia Liu : I think like Gale mentioned, this is a pretty balanced generation reshaping plan. So I think our spend in Wisconsin generation is pretty balanced over the 5 years. So you would think that it's incremental each year over the 5-year period. Gale Klappa : No. Yes, absolutely. So again, we have a number of projects in the pipeline, and we're very optimistic. But really I mentioned earlier the benefits of the legislation. -- in terms of customer affordability are really significant. And Scott, you might want to just talk about the time frame. I mean, the quicker we put these in, the quicker the benefits flow. Scott Lauber : Sure, absolutely, Gale. So as we talked about earlier, we have three projects that are actually in construction right now. And then there is two significant commission right now waiting for their review to go through the process. But when you look at the $2 billion of savings, as we get these in, those production tax credits, as you can imagine, are probably starting in that 2025, 2026, 2027 time frame as the projects start going into service. And we already factored some of those in for the ones that are in construction now. So about $2 billion of savings over the 20-years. But as you remember, using those production tax credits for solar, we are going to be able to give those back to customers much faster. Gale Klappa : Over 10-years. Scott Lauber : Over 10-years and they will hit right away versus 30-years with investment tax credit. So very favorable for customers long-term. Gale Klappa : Durgesh, I hope that helps respond. Thank you. Durgesh Chopra : That is very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Sorry to cut you off there. I really had two questions. One was on the gas side and one on the financing side. This is one of your first five-year plans, where capital spend on the gas distribution system, not only didn't go up, it was flattish, maybe even down a little bit. if I go back and look over the last number of years, you would add increasing levels of gas related capital spend for reliability purposes, not just Illinois, but Wisconsin as well. Just curious what you are seeing there and what some of the drivers behind that are. Gale Klappa : Sure. And I will ask Scott and Xia to give their view as well. But long story short, Michael, you are correct. When you look at the allocation of capital across the five-year plan, the gas distribution part of that capital is pretty flat. But I think it reflects two things. First of all, it reflects the real investment need and opportunity as we continue to decarbonize the system the electric system in Wisconsin. So that is a driving need, which has really grown the capital portion. So renewable generation is way up in the capital allocation compared to prior years. We have continued to make progress. But again, with the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act and our continued focus on retiring older coal-fired units the opportunity and the need for renewable investment has grown. So that is, in my mind, the biggest factor. And then the fact that the gas distribution piece is flat, I think, reflects two things. One, reflects that we have a quite modern system, but we are also bolstering that system, and we are not too far from the end of building LNG storage facilities for our gas distribution network in Wisconsin. But that spending, I mean, where construction is going very well and that spending will tail off as those LNG storage facilities come into service. And then, of course, the spending on the pipe replacement program in Chicago continues at pace, but at about the same level. Scott, anything you would like to add? Scott Lauber : You are exactly correct, Gale. I think the key item is remember, those liquified natural gas storage tanks are going in construction going well, going to add capacity for our distribution system and a majority of that spending is being done this year. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then I have a follow-on question. Just for holding company-related debt as well as debt at the energy infrastructure segments. Just can you remind us kind of what is the percent of raw dollar amount that is at either of those two boxes and what is the level of maturities and kind of how you are thinking about refinancing levels just given the broader move in rates? Gale Klappa : Yes. Well, Xia's got the exact details sitting right in front of her, but let me frame that for you because I think you are asking a very good question. And again, it is an area where I think we separate ourselves from some other companies because, as you know, we have always used conservative financing techniques, conservative financing plans. And so our percentage of floating rate debt compared to the total debt outstanding is really quite low. So I will let Xia give you the details. Xia Liu : Yes. I think you know we have a target holding company to total debt around 30%. So remaining around that number. And to Gale Klappa Gail's point, the risk capital percentage is pretty modest for us. So I think that helps us from a rising interest rate environment. And again, we try to assume pretty conservative interest rates in the forecast period, both at the utilities and the holding company at key at level. So I think we are addressing the interest rate exposure that way. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then last question, just on the increase in the ATC, the transmission spend, should we assume that a large chunk of that is a little bit on the back-end loaded side just due to siding and permitting? Gale Klappa : Actually, if you would asked that question two years ago or even a year ago, I think Scott and I would have said, yes, particularly with Tranche one from the MISO long-term planning process, we would have probably said it is way out into the decade. But now I think you are going to see some of that spending really uptick in 2025 and beyond. Scott Lauber : Yes. And we will be putting a slide together in our new investor deck, but you are actually going to start seeing it on 2025, 2026 as it relates to Tranche 1, but actually some additional investments in American Transmission Company starting in 2024. So it is a good - the long plan in American Transmission Company just came out with their 10-year assessment that even shows a longer growth period here. So it is actually up about 50% from last year's 10-year assessment. So a real positive, and I think it is going to be a longer term plan. It starts earlier and longer. Gale Klappa : And part of that, Michael, you are asking a great question. Part of that is because some of the early opportunities that have been identified through the MISO Tranche one are really upgrades or additions or expansions on existing rights of way with transmission already in place. And that helps tremendously in terms of just being able to get things moving, not have to get new permits in terms of new rights of way. So there is a real positive development coming out of tranche one that you see beginning to be reflected in our five-year plan. Michael Lapides : Got it, thank you guys. much appreciated. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Take care Michael. Operator : Next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Fleishman : Actually, I think last time I saw it, Gale, you talked about sitting around waiting for panels to come out of a warehouse. So maybe you could just kind of talk a little bit about how you are doing on the kind of current renewables projects in terms of just the supply chain and you flip? Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question. And you are right. The last time you and I were together actually at the Wolfe Conference in late September, we were talking about kind of how are we going to keep, for example, the construction of Badger Hollow II, very large, regulated solar farm in Southwestern Wisconsin under construction but badly needing delivery of solar panels. And Scott has some good news for you on the developments out of the warehouse in Chicago. Scott Lauber : Yes, Gale. So we have got about 50 megawatts in a warehouse in Chicago. The first 30 megawatts have been released. They just saw a picture yesterday. They are starting to be assembled on site. So that is really good news. We are working on the remaining 20 megawatts. So construction continues at that site. And we have orders placed now we figured out - we think we have the path figured out for the other solar panels. So orders are placed and getting things moving along here. So it is great to see them start the construction at the pair of sites. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And so just like overall, in terms of time line for start-up, where are you now versus where you might have been before on Badger Hollow? Scott Lauber : Yes. We are still looking at it in early 2023. It will all depend upon the weather and the supply chain. But right now, we think we have a path for supply chain. The weather may even be more of a factor here in Wisconsin for Badger Hollow too. But we are watching it very closely here. But right now, we are not really changing our time line at this time. Gale Klappa : And the good news, Steve, as Scott said, things are starting to move for the first time in months. Steven Fleishman : Okay. That is good. And then just one other question. I know you have got a governor election in Wisconsin next week. And I'm sure energy has not been one of the top three, four, 10 topics in the election. But just curious if it were to switch back Republican, do you see any change in emphasis in the state that would impact your business? Gale Klappa : The short answer, Steve, is we really don't see a change. And the race is by all public polling and all of the information we have seen, the race is a toss-up. Depending upon which poll you look at, there is a one or two percentage point difference in terms of support for each of the candidates. Governor Evers, of course, the sitting governor, has been very supportive of our transition plan, our decarbonization plan, but also understands that natural gas is going to be needed for reliability, both in heating and on power generation in Wisconsin. So the governor has had a very balanced approach. And as you say, energy is really not a major issue that is being debated. I think the top two certainly would be crime and inflation. The Republican candidate, Tim Michaels, I think the best description of Tim Michaels is he's an infrastructure guy. He and his family I think his grandfather perhaps started Michael's construction. They now have 8,000 employees, and they literally are an infrastructure construction company. They worked on the Keystone pipeline. I mean, he is an individual that understands the need for reliable infrastructure. So whichever way the election goes, I think we are going to be in very good shape. Steven Fleishman : Great, thank you. Gale Klappa : Thanks Steve, take care. See you in EEI. Operator : The next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Your line is open. Anthony Crowdell : I was going to ask you, why Shar is already packing for EEI, but a quick question, most of them are answered. Just, I guess, on inflation. You guys have maintained guidance, you are navigating all the challenges that maybe some others are stumbling over. Just what is the most challenging part of inflation of like headwind in the cost pressures, is it on labor, is it on materials, supply chain, or is it really just interest rates? What gives you the biggest problems going to bed at night on these inflation pressures? Gale Klappa : Well, and we will ask Scott and Xia to give you their idea of what keeps them up at night. I would say for us, in my mind, we have been most concerned about getting solar panels moved getting solar panels to our construction sites. I mean for most of the projects that we have underway, and we have got several billion dollars of projects underway, mean we have locked in much of the cost. I mean, there is obviously some movement in solar panel costs, et cetera. But to me, the biggest thing that was keeping me up at night was actually being able to complete these solar projects that are important to our capacity and to our meeting summer demand simply because of the holdup in the freezing, if you will, of the movement of solar panels. To me, that was the biggest issue. Interest rates, I mean, they have moved dramatically. That is probably a classic British understatement. But again, given the forward-looking test periods in Wisconsin, I mean, as Xia said earlier, we projected reasonable interest rates given the inflationary environment we are in, and that is part of the rate settlement that we have come to with the major parties in the case. So in terms of interest rate increases. I think we are covered there because of the whole mechanism of putting the rate cases in place. We are starting to see solar panels move. And Scott, I assume we are going to see some increase in some of the commodity costs that affect the overall capital program. Scott Lauber : No, that is exactly correct, Gale. And like Gale have said, the solar panel is probably the biggest one to see them move and start getting on site at Badger Hollow II getting put in service is really positive. We are seeing some cost increases from inflation, we, of course, factor that all into our rate case filing and our filing - our supplemental filing we did in the end of June to factor that in. The other item and the team has done a great job from the supply chain to our operations, really working with our vendors on supply chain and delivering different distribution parts. We haven't had any significant issues. There is just a lot of day-to-day conversations, week-to-week conversations to make sure the supplies on what we need for our construction move forward. So everything is going along really well here. But all that inflation was factored into the test year. Gale Klappa : And Anthony, it was great to see - one other quick thought for what it is worth. It was great to see in the last few weeks, a pretty sizable decline in spot prices for natural gas. So perhaps the winter gas costs will be less onerous than some earlier projections. . And I will say though, one of the things very pleased about, we have talked with the state regulators and our state commissioners about this, we are in good shape from a supply standpoint for winter heating for natural gas. You have seen in some other parts of the country, particularly in the Northeast, where that may not be the case regardless of price. So I think we are going to see perhaps some moderation in natural gas prices overall for the winter for heating season and a supply that we believe we can count on and keep people warm. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And if I could just sneak one last one in before you end up with a Jimmy Carter sweater to keep warm, but higher prices. But just are you noticing any change in valuations public versus private valuations and some of the assets now that we have seen rising rates. I'm sure you get a lot of bankers pitching you a lot of assets to buy or sell and just wondering if you are seeing any change as rates have risen that maybe the private market use some assets as less desirable versus this recent rise in rates. Gale Klappa : Well, let me answer it this way. In some ways, the increase in interest rates is helpful to us on the infrastructure side of the business, because some of the competitors that we might face for some of these high-quality assets load on a lot more debt in their capital plan than we do. So again, we finance our infrastructure segment just like we finance our overall enterprise, about 50% equity and 50% debt, roughly. So as interest rates have risen, that changes the economics of a competitor for an infrastructure project that is loading on a ton of debt. We don't do that. We haven't done that. And so I think actually, in some perverse way, the higher interest rates has even been beneficial in terms of our competitive position for the infrastructure segments. Scott, Xia, anything you would like to add? Scott Lauber : No, I agree, Gale. I think our approach, our consistency, really helps as we look at the infrastructure. And as you can see, we were able to announce another deal there yesterday. Gale Klappa : And one we are very excited about. Anthony Crowdell : Thanks so much for the time Gale, looking forward to seeing you at EEI. Gale Klappa : Sounds great. Thank you. Take care. Operator : The next question is from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Nicholas Campanella : So listen, I wanted to - just a couple of follow-up questions. So just going back to Xia Liu's comments on just the credit side and reflecting IRA, and I know you are still kind of working through the FFO to debt target over the long-term. Some of your peers have communicated a cash flow uplift in the near years of the five-year plan. And I'm just curious as you see it today. Is that a similar dynamic that is going on in WEC? Gale Klappa : We will ask Xia to give you her view. Xia Liu : Absolutely. If you keep the capital the same, and just look at the IRA impact, if you just layer IRA on top of the existing capital plan, you definitely would see that uptick on cash flow profile. So as I said just now, it allows us to finance the increased capital plan and still maintain the long-term FFO to debt metrics. If that makes any sense to you. Nicholas Campanella : Yes. Got it. Alright thanks a lot. And then, Xia, just while I have you, you mentioned the 10.3% return on equity at ATC going forward. Does that not include any adders and just how do we think about kind of total ROE? Xia Liu : That is the total ROE, 10.38% just to be precise, that includes the 50 basis point adder. Nicholas Campanella : Got it. Okay. And then I guess my last one is a follow-up on kind of the M&A question, but more on the regulated side. Gale, you have had a really successful M&A playbook over the last decade, it is driven size and scale efficiencies for your customers and for investors. And my question isn't about your main criteria, whether or not it is changed or not, but just like how is the executive team viewing M&A in this current environment with cost of capital being so high. Obviously, the industry is dealing with customer bill pressures and to be kind of apparent across every state. But does that drive more consolidation in your mind and create opportunity or just how should we kind of think about that from a higher level? Thanks. Gale Klappa : Yes, it is a great question. And I will bore everybody, but I will not repeat the three criteria. You all know them. But maybe at EEI, we can put it on a wall. But to your question, which is a good one, I do think over time and history shows that we are in a consolidating industry. I mean, goodness, if you turn the clock back to 1995, there were literally 100 on publicly traded investor-owned utilities like ours in the United States. Today, there are roughly 37. So we are in a scale business, scale and efficiency matter. Particularly in an era of increased capital spend, scale and efficiency matter because you know the formula, it is one for eight. We call it the power of one to eight. For every dollar of O&M efficiency you can drive through the enterprise, it makes room for $8 of capital without customer rate pressure. So over time, I do think we will continue to consolidate in the industry. But in the interim here, folks are dealing with a fairly sizable - I think, across the board, fairly sizable capital plans. And the question is, can those plans be more cost effectively implemented if you have greater size and scale and a strong balance sheet. So I think over time, the answer is going to be more consolidation. I would expect, though, it would look more like MOEs, modified or modified mergers of equals as opposed to the old style of M&A, which was, in some cases, driven by debt driven by leverage and driven by low interest costs. So I think the flavor of M&A may be different long-term, I suspect it will be, but it will come in fits and starts. At least that is my view. And thank you for the question. Nicholas Campanella : Thanks for the answer and looking forward to seeing you down in Florida. Take care. Gale Klappa : Sounds great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : I was just thinking a higher level here. I just wanted to touch on your expertise on the space. And thinking about the transmission needs broadly after talking about significant customer benefits from Ira, how do you see the seams issue impacting transmission development overall and just any other thoughts on how to address this or other roadblocks to really effectively get into regional projects and planning going? Gale Klappa : Jeremy, interesting question. I will give you two thoughts for what they are worth. The first is the seams issue, I think, goes back to the days of Edison. I mean there have been seams issues for as long as I can remember in this industry. The regional power grids, if you will, I think, have made some progress, but the SEM issues are real. And I think it is a matter that FERC is very interested in resolving. These things take a tremendous amount of time. But my guess is that you are going to see much more inter power-grid cooperation or forced cooperation, one or the other. And these seams issues while they will continue on simply because of the nature of the grids are going to be less and less and less in my view over the next 10-years. I think they simply will have to be. Scott, your view on that. Scott Lauber : No, I agree with you Gale. I think as more and more transmission gets built, they are going to see it is even natural to hook more of it together. So it may fall into place, but it will take a long time. Gale Klappa : The other point I would make is that the gestation period for new transmission that is not an upgrade of existing transmission or an expansion of existing transmission. The gestation period is simply just too long. We have talked about this, there is a transmission project, for example, that was first envision more than 10-years ago in our region that is still not fully constructed. It is gone through all of the approvals, but it is going through a very arduous court process right now. So I think there are two areas that really have to be worked on to continue to decarbonize the system and keep electricity reliable across the country. One is the seams issue but also it is just the lengthy period it takes to basically build greenfield transmission. I hope that helps. Jeremy Tonet : That is very helpful, I will leave it there. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Our final question for today is from Vedula Murti with Hudson Bay Capital. Your line is open. Vedula Murti : In terms of the renewables build-out, can you help us in terms of like over the period here, how much the capacity factors and the credit that you would be able to get from MISO for system availability of things that nature have improved, I mean because if we go back to ERCOT early on, win was like 10, 12, 15, whatever, stuff like that. So just kind of guesses of what kind of world thumb is and as we go forward, whether there is any whether repower intent or emerging technologies actually provide a step function opportunity. Gale Klappa : Well, first of all, one of these days, when we are on a call with you and I ask how you are doing. I know you are going to say wonderful an award-winning, but we will wait for that day. And Vedula, I'm not sure I completely understood your question in terms - I think what you were asking, but please clarify if I'm off base here. I think what you are asking is, do we have an opportunity to repower some of our existing assets to get more capacity credit in the Midwest power grid. Is that your question, Vedula? Vedula Murti : That is the second part. And the first part is the 3400 megawatts, both wind and solar. What type of capacity credit would you anticipate now from MISO as opposed to what it might have been like five-years ago or something like that in terms of the improvement? Gale Klappa : Okay. Well, MISO has been very specific about the particular capacity credit for a particular type of renewables. Scott. Scott Lauber : No. Exactly, Gale. And I think when you think about when that compete capacity in the summertime is around 14%, 15%, 16%, where solar is in that 65% to 70%. But as you know, we are going through a process now of looking at more seasonal capacity. So you need to look at the fall the spring, the winter and the summer. And we are currently working through all those. I think the final information is going to come out closer in December on how these seasonal capacities will be looked at. But the capacity here, it is at 14%, 15% for the summer for the wind and that 65%, 70% for the solar. Gale Klappa : I hope that responds to your question, Vedula. Vedula Murti : Yes. And I guess one last thing, tied to that if to the extent that you have repowering opportunities, I guess, I'm wondering how that is going to compete with capital allocation relative to newer projects and as we go forward here, especially as you have more critical scale across that business line? Gale Klappa : And there will be some repowering opportunities, no question, particularly with some of the older renewables when I say older, 10 to 15-years ago, for example, we are the largest owner and operator of wind farms in the State of Wisconsin and some of those came on more than a decade ago. So as the technology has improved and as wind turbines have become even more efficient, for example, there are going to be opportunities going forward. But long story short, I don't see this as crowding out. I don't see that opportunity in any way is crowding out because we have so much need to reshape our generation system and to continue to meet those goals, the aggressive environmental goals of an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions done in a way that is affordable, reliable and clean by the end of 2030. Vedula Murti : Okay, thank you very much and I will see you in Florida. Gale Klappa : Terrific, thank you so much. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. We look forward to seeing you at EEI and in the meantime, thanks again, everybody. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group\u2019s Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year End \u201822 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with these statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. The replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.  And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for calendar year 2022. First, I\u2019d like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2022 earnings of $4.45 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes. But I\u2019m pleased to report to you that we delivered an exceptional year on virtually every meaningful measure from employee safety and customer satisfaction to growth in earnings per share. Three major factors really shaped our strong results for 2022 : favorable weather; solid performance from our infrastructure and transmission segments; and steady execution of our capital plan, as we paved the way for an energy future that\u2019s affordable, reliable, and clean. On the regulatory front, as you may know, we saw balanced and credit supportive results from our Wisconsin rate reviews in December, despite a little bit of noise in the process. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And last month, on January 6th, we filed rate requests with the Illinois Commerce Commission for our gas utilities in Illinois. I would point out that home heating bills in Chicago are currently below those of other major U.S. cities, like New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. And we expect that to continue with this filing. Scott will provide you with more detail in just a moment. Turning now to our ESG progress plan that we updated for you in November. It\u2019s the largest five-year investment plan in our history, totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability, and growth. We expect the plan to drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the period 2023 through 2027. The key part of the plan is a major commitment to renewable projects, both in our regulated business and in our infrastructure segment. In fact, earlier this week, we announced that our infrastructure group will acquire an 80% ownership interest in Phase 1 of the Samson Solar Energy Center. Located in Northeast Texas, Samson I has a capacity of 250 megawatts. It entered commercial service in May of last year and has a long-term power purchase agreement with AT&T. Pending final regulatory approval, we plan to invest approximately $250 million for our portion of Samson I. We expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter of this year. Samson I, as you may know, is the first of 5 phases being developed by Invenergy. Overall, Samson is the largest solar project under construction in the United States today, and we\u2019re pleased to take part in Phase 1. Now, as you know, one of our goals is to help shape the future of clean energy. And today, we\u2019re announcing an important pilot project with the Electric Power Research Institute and a company called CMBlu Energy. CMBlu is a German designer of long duration battery storage using common low-cost, environmentally-friendly materials. In simple English, it\u2019s a green battery. This 1 to 2 megawatt hour pilot project will be one of the first of its kind on the United States electric grid. Our plan is to test the durability of this battery system. We believe it can store energy for up to twice as long as the typical batteries in use today. We plan to launch the project at our Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee in the fourth quarter of this year when temperatures turn cold. The results will be shared in early 2024 across the industry. And now, let\u2019s switch gears and take a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 52,000 private sector jobs in 2022, and in December, the unemployment rate in the state dropped to 3.2%. That\u2019s well below the national average. We believe the current strength and remarkable diversity of the Wisconsin economy positions us well as we move forward in 2023. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations, and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I\u2019d like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. First, let\u2019s review where we stand for the Wisconsin Public Service Commission\u2019s written orders this past December. The commission authorized return on equity of 9.8% for all our Wisconsin utilities. It approved an increase in the equity component of our capital structure to 53%. We\u2019ll also continue the earning sharing mechanism to provide benefits to Wisconsin customers if our performance exceeds our forecast. And as Gail mentioned, we now have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. At Peoples Gas, we are not seeking an extension of the automatic bill adjustment rider known as QIP, after it expires at the end of this year. We plan to return to the traditional rate making process to recover the cost of necessary infrastructure improvements. Our rate request would continue to support those key capital investments. Peoples Gas operates one of the oldest natural gas delivery networks in the United States. And as you may recall, an independent engineering study found that over 80% of the iron pipes in the system are approaching the end of their useful life. We are modernizing the system to ensure safety and reliability and to reduce methane emissions. With natural gas prices declining, we project customer bills will remain largely flat as the new rates take effect in 2024. You may also recall we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources last November. We are seeking an overall increase of 8.1%, primarily driven by capital investments. Interim rates went into effect January 1st. Meanwhile, we\u2019re making good progress on a number of our regulatory capital projects. Our Red Barn wind development is on track to come online within the next few months in Wisconsin with an expected investment of $160 million. This project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system. Work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect the solar parks to go into service this year, assuming timely release of the panels. We also received regulatory approval for our purchase of the Darien Solar-Battery Park, with plans for 225 megawatts of solar capacity and 68 megawatts of battery storage. We expect this facility to go into service in 2024. Of course, we\u2019ll keep you updated on any future developments. And just last month with an investment of approximately $75 million, we closed our purchase of the Whitewater combined cycle plant, a 236 megawatt facility. As a reminder, we previously received energy and capacity from this natural gas unit under a purchase power agreement. In the natural gas business we have been working to bring high quality renewable natural gas to our customers. We signed another contract in January, which brings us to a planned total of 1 billion cubic feet of RNG that\u2019ll enter our system annually. We expect RNG to flow this year, supporting our aggressive goals to reduce methane emissions. Outside our utilities, we continue to make good progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. The Thunderhead Wind Farm in Nebraska is now in service. In addition, we expect to complete the acquisition of Sapphire Sky in Illinois in the coming weeks as commercial operation begins. And as Gale noted, we\u2019re excited about our plans to add the Samson I solar project in our infrastructure segment before the end of the first quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Great, Scott. Thank you very much. We\u2019re confident that we can deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023. As you recall, we\u2019re guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share. The midpoint $4.60 a share represents growth of 6.7% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And as we\u2019ve discussed, we expect to fund our capital plan without any need to issue equity. And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We\u2019re right in the middle of that range now, so you can expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia, all yours. Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2022 earnings of $4.45 per share increased $0.34 per share or 8.3% compared to 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2022 results on page 17. I\u2019ll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.19 compared to 2021. Weather drove a $0.04 increase in earnings compared to 2021. Rate base growth contributed $0.41 to earnings, and lower day-to-day O&M expense resulted in a $0.02 improvement and achieved our goal for the year. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense related to continued capital investment and a $0.12 increase in fuel expense, mainly driven by higher natural gas costs. In terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.1%. Small commercial and industrial sales increased 0.5%, while residential and large commercial and industrial sales stayed relatively flat. Overall, our sales mix was stronger than our forecast. Our sales projections for 2023 can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the earnings package. Overall, we are projecting relatively flat electric and gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.07 compared to 2021. If you recall, $0.05 related to the resolution of historical appeals that we discussed on our third quarter earnings call. As previously discussed, beginning with the third quarter of 2022 and going forward, we are recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.14 in 2022 compared to 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits as a result of stronger wind production and the addition of our Jayhawk wind farm that went into commercial operation at the end of 2021. In addition, recall that we recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution earlier in 2022 from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool. Finally, you\u2019ll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and lower gains recognized on our investment in the clean energy fund. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M. Overall, we improved on our 2021 performance by $0.34 per share. Looking now at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $28 million. And total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.7 billion in 2022, a $324 million increase as compared to 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan. Finally, let\u2019s look at our earnings guidance. In terms of first quarter 2023 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.72 per share. This forecast takes into account the fourth warmest January on record since the 1880s and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Remember, last year, we earned $1.79 per share in the first quarter, which included $0.02 of favorable weather, $0.03 from the Southwest Power Pool settlement and $0.03 from our investment in the clean energy fund. And for the full year 2023, we\u2019re reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. We\u2019re also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the next five years. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we\u2019re ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll. Shar, you\u2019re ready for the West Coast? Shar Pourreza : I am ready for the West Coast. I\u2019m packing my bag just. Shar Pourreza : Just two quick ones for you. Just on the transmission CapEx with ATC, which obviously just pretty healthy uptick. In the past, I know you\u2019ve said you were seeing increases as early as 25 for Tranche 1 with LRTP and additional investments even earlier in \u201824. I guess, can you maybe talk about the cadence of this current increase as we\u2019re thinking about the spending profile? And do you see more opportunities? Any sense on how you\u2019re thinking about Tranche 2? Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question, Shar. Let me unpack the second piece of the question first, if that\u2019s satisfactory. On the second piece of the question really about Tranche 2, and again, just to level set everyone, MISO is going through a very thorough and rigorous long-term planning process for transmission investment in the region. They have been through and have now completed Phase 1 Tranche 1 -- I\u2019m sorry, Future 1 Tranche 1. So now we\u2019re into Future 1 Tranche 2. And it\u2019s a little too early to tell you precisely what we\u2019re seeing in the planning for Tranche 2. But I can tell you that what we\u2019re seeing so far in the stakeholder discussions at MISO is that -- is I think a good probability that the amount of investment opportunity for American Transmission Company in Tranche 2 is potentially greater than what we\u2019re even seeing in Tranche 1. So, we\u2019re optimistic about that. I would expect that we will be able to give you more detail before the end of this year on kind of the broad numbers as they emerge in the planning process. And Scott, would you like to handle kind of the cadence question? Scott Lauber : Sure. So, when you look at -- and we\u2019ll hear the end of this year or the beginning of next year as Tranche 2, we\u2019ll just see how fast that process goes. When you look at the projects, starting to ramp up really in \u201824 and \u201825, and that\u2019s related to Tranche 1, but also, we saw a lot of entries here at American Transmission Company just looking at connecting renewables on the state. So, that was about half of our increase in the prior year along with Tranche 1. So, I expect we\u2019re going to see more of that as we look forward over the next 5 to 10 years, too. Gale Klappa : Shar, Scott is making a good point. Not only are we seeing the need for additional transmission related to these longer term projects that are part of the MISO planning but just to hook in the significant number of renewable projects being built in Wisconsin, that\u2019s an additional uptick, if you will, in our plan from just the Wisconsin connections for many renewable projects under development here. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And then, just lastly, just Gale, on the current 5-year plan. I know you guys budgeted roughly $1.9 billion in the Infrastructure segment. Obviously, you had two recent announcements with investing in sort of PTC eligible solar projects, I think, for the first time, obviously, in this segment. How are you sort of thinking about the remaining $1.1 billion of capital, I think you plan to deploy in this business? And should we expect more solar, more wind, or perhaps can you open it up to other technologies, which are obviously now PTC eligible post IRA? Thanks. Gale Klappa : Shar, we certainly could open it up to other technologies, but the big likelihood, given what we\u2019re seeing in the pipeline of projects that we\u2019re doing due diligence on, the big likelihood is they will largely be solar and wind. And you\u2019re referring to the announcement we just made a couple of days ago, the Samson 1 Solar Energy Center in North Texas. That project, we\u2019re very pleased to be a part of. It is coming in a little earlier. I think internally, we all thought that we would probably add another solar project toward the end of 2023. So, that\u2019s actually good news that it\u2019s coming in a little earlier. And as I mentioned, we hope to close on that transaction final -- given final regulatory approval late in the first quarter. I hope that helps, Shar. Shar Pourreza : It always does. And Scott always makes good points, by the way. I appreciate it, guys, and I\u2019ll see you soon. Gale Klappa : Sounds good. Great. Thank you, Shar. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Julien. Julien, are you and your wife buying a dog yet? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Oh, my God. Just you wait, just you wait. I\u2019ll give you the update next quarter. Oh, my God. So, just coming back to Wisconsin really quick. Just reopen your filing, if we can talk about super quickly. Obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of attention of late. Perhaps just at the outset, any comments and reactions of what\u2019s transpired here and just how to think about that reopener? And then within that, just a couple of subpoints, just West Riverside, how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to submit data to prove the benefits for WEC are greater or at least equal to LNC? And then with respect to Oak Creek, some of the same considerations around what are the unrecovered balances of scrubbers and other plant? And do you see any specific obstacles around Oak Creek retirement and recovery on that front? Gale Klappa : Okay. Well, let\u2019s kind of -- I\u2019m glad you got it all out. Let\u2019s try to kind of walk through that, if I forget, Scott and Xia, any of the elements of the question, Scott and Xia will help remind me. But first, I think you were asking about the \"limited reopener\u201d that was part of the rate decision in December. So the limited reopener is for 2024, and it truly is a limited reopener relating to the investment cost of several projects that will be coming into service over the course of 2023. All of them regulated projects -- I think virtually all of them are really the renewable projects, Scott, that we are underway with here. So, the limited reopener is simply to reopen and put into rates recovery of the investment costs for projects that have already been approved and are under development, Scott, got by the commission. Scott Lauber : Yes. It\u2019ll be very specific. For example, the liquefied natural gas plants we have going on in our gas system, some of the renewable projects I talked about in the prepared remarks, and some of the new RICE units that we have going in, in Weston. So, it\u2019s very specific projects. For instance, LNG goes in at the end of the year, we\u2019ll just factor that in for a full year then. So, those -- that should be very straightforward as we do that filing. Gale Klappa : Yes, exactly. There\u2019s no reopener related to the equity layer or the ROE. This is simply related to capital investments in projects already approved. So, I hope that answers that question. And then, in terms of just the general backdrop, I think one of the things that I believe Julien you actually did an interview with the Chairperson of the Wisconsin Commission, I would just encourage everyone to listen and read through some of the additional comments that she has made related to her view of the future of regulation in Wisconsin, wanting very much to be credit supportive as the decision was of our Wisconsin utilities and wanting to maintain the reputation of the Wisconsin Commission is very professional and certainly carrying out day-to-day the concept of gradualism. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, on Riverside, we have already provided on time, all of the additional modeling data that the commission asked for in terms of modeling the impact of us exercising the Riverside option and to level set everyone. Riverside is a natural gas combined cycle plant at Alliant built. During the construction process, we agreed with Alliant that we would have two options each for 100 megawatts per option to essentially acquire at book value, those megawatts over a certain period of time. So, this particular question that you have relates to the first option. And again, the modeling data that the commission asked for is in their hands right now. And we expect sometime in the next 45, certainly no more than 60 days for the commission to take up the matter. So, I hope that responds and I hope we didn\u2019t miss anything. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: A lot there. Just lastly, super quick. On Oak Creek, just the current unrecovered balance of scrubber and plant, just as far as getting recovery there and any obstacles in that end? That was the last one. Gale Klappa : Okay. Great. Thank you for reminding us. The current book balance for the older Oak Creek units -- remember, there are four older Oak Creek units. They\u2019re labeled Oak Creek 5, 6, 7 and 8. Those units went into service, I mean, literally, I think the oldest one was 1959 and the others are 1960s vintage units. So, the base plant itself, there\u2019s almost no book value left. The major part of the book value is in the emission controls, the modern emission controls that we build and put on those units at least a decade ago now. And that is roughly about $400 million. But I would remind everyone that that\u2019s not a subject for the limited reopener in Wisconsin in 2024, because the retirement dates have been pushed out a bit, given the tight capacity market. Scott, anything you\u2019d like to add? Scott Lauber : And remember, when we look at those retirements. We also -- when they do retire, when all 4 of them retire, that\u2019s like $30 million to $35 million of reduced O&M expense along with less fuel cost. So, we\u2019ll be looking at them. I think our current date is May of \u201824. So potentially, we\u2019ll be analyzing it, but we\u2019ve got to look at our capacity situation. But right now, that is the plan. So, maybe part of the limited reopener. When you look at the whole picture, it reduces O&M costs, it reduces fuel cost. And remember, we\u2019re replacing a lot of this capacity, some of it\u2019s with renewables and get that production tax credits there in the front end. It\u2019s going to be very good for customers. Gale Klappa : Yes. Scott\u2019s right. There\u2019s some immediate significant savings. And you think about $30 million to $35 million of O&M savings from the closure of the plant. And on top of that, you get fuel cost savings. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just wanted to pick up a little bit on the prior conversation there with regards to Wisconsin Commission. And are you hearing anything from the Governor or stakeholders about who the next commissioner might be if the Governor has any particular policy goals for the commission that could potentially be expressed in this next nominee? Gale Klappa : No. In terms of any particular change of policy goals, no. The conversations we\u2019re hearing related to the concept of what the appropriate next appointee will be, really, in my opinion and from everything we\u2019ve heard, revolve around the major concerns that the Governor has had since he took office, which is reliability, affordability and the continued transition away from fossil fuels, but in a pace and in a manner that preserves reliability. So, nothing different in terms of our belief in the Governor\u2019s policy objectives. And the other thing that I would say is I would be shocked if the vetting process was not already underway. We would expect some type of an appointment announcement, if you will, I would guess, in the next 60 days. The other point, I think, that\u2019s important to remember is all the governors appointees have to be confirmed by the state Senate. And the Senate is heavily Republican. And I think all of that leads to the type of an appointment that\u2019s really close to the center line in terms of philosophy and in terms of approach of continuing the same type of approach the commission has been noted for over the course of many decades. I hope that helps, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Yes. No, that\u2019s helpful there. I didn\u2019t mean -- I don\u2019t think I said different. I was just more thinking just type of policy as far as -- we were under the impression that maybe some labor-oriented policy might be in focus here. So, I didn\u2019t know if that was something that had come across our radar, but we can move along here. Gale Klappa : Well, Jeremy, actually, to your point, we do know, and we\u2019ve had conversations with the Governor\u2019s office. As more and more renewable projects are under development, under construction inside the state of Wisconsin, we do know the Governor\u2019s office is very interested and making sure as many of those jobs as possible are Wisconsin jobs. So, what you\u2019re saying would not be a particular surprise. I think that\u2019s been part of the Governor\u2019s agenda from the very beginning. Jeremy Tonet : Right. Right. Great. Thank you for that. And then kind of moving along and recognizing it\u2019s earlier in the PGS rate case process, but have you received any stakeholder feedback here, particularly in how the QIP rider impacts this? And any sense from the legislature on an extension? Gale Klappa : Well, as you probably recall, our filing position, if you will, and we announced when we filed the case on January 6th, that it would not be our intention to try to extend the QIP rider through legislation. It\u2019s pretty clear from conversations with a number of the policymakers, including the Governor\u2019s office in Illinois, that the preference is to return to traditional rate making procedures for all the capital investments that PGL and North Shore are making, but in particular, the capital investments that had been part of the, what we call, the QIP rider program. So, when you think about it and actually -- we\u2019ve really talked about this a lot internally. First of all, important to point out that the Illinois regulatory process in these rate reviews utilizes a forward-looking test period. So, even with going to a traditional ratemaking process, you\u2019re in a forward-looking test period. So, that should help in terms of eliminating regulatory lag. Number one. Number two, actually going through a rate review with all of the testimony and all of the different stakeholders being able to voice their opinions, actually, I think it\u2019s going to be a positive thing because there\u2019s been noise about the method of recovery of the investment as opposed to the need for the investment. What this will allow us to do -- this process over the course of 2023, this will allow us to again make the case for why the upgrade of aging, deteriorating piping systems underneath Chicago is so, so necessary for the safety and efficiency and stability of gas distribution in Chicago. So actually, we kind of look forward to the debate. And we look forward to the whole process, which Scott will take probably through close to December. Scott Lauber : It would take most of the year. And they\u2019re just -- currently, we\u2019ll -- we haven\u2019t even seen a final schedule yet. So, that will be coming out. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Gale Klappa : Is that responsive, Jeremy? Jeremy Tonet : That is very helpful. Just one last one, if I could here. Just after this latest solar investment with the Samson announcement, how does the broader market interest currently stand? Anything notable to highlight here on this transaction? Gale Klappa : No, other than -- I mean, other than -- in this particular transaction, there\u2019s really no construction risk because the facility went into service in May of last year. So, we really have no construction risk here whatsoever. We\u2019ve got a year of operating data that we can base our due diligence on. And again, we\u2019re really pleased with this particular investment. And we think it\u2019s going to, again, add really high, high-quality project to our infrastructure portfolio. Jeremy Tonet : And just on the ITCs, had you guys disclosed how many years you\u2019re amortizing this over? Gale Klappa : Well, we\u2019re using production tax credits instead of investment tax credits, and that\u2019s really what helps our economics here. I mean, obviously, with the Inflation Reduction Act, solar is now eligible, you can choose either ITCs or PTCs. And our choice here is clearly PTCs, which will be spread over, Scott, a 10-year period. Scott Lauber : 10-year period. And adding that second solar farm in our portfolio really adds diversity to portfolio, too. So, really happy to adding that second solar. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey Gale, how are you? Gale Klappa : We\u2019re good. You\u2019re keeping Steve straight? Michael Sullivan : All good. We\u2019re going to steal Aaron Rodgers from, too. Gale Klappa : He looks good in green, I believe. Michael Sullivan : Yes, actually. Anyways, I wanted to start with just the credit metrics. I think you all used to give a reconciliation of FFO to debt with year-end earnings. Do you have that off the top of your head? Are you able to give where that ended up shaking out for the year? Gale Klappa : Sure. We\u2019ll ask Xia to give you a response to that. Xia Liu : Michael, we disclosed the longer-term credit metrics and -- but we have all the actual data, and we\u2019ll be happy to provide that to you. I think it\u2019s all public information. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And then I just wanted to check on the solar build out. Scott, I think you said like assuming release of panels, which has kind of been like a little bit of a moving target? Just any updated color there on where things stand with where the panels are and being able to get them? Scott Lauber : Yes. So, we\u2019ve been able to get them in the U.S. We\u2019ve been able to get them in the warehouse. In fact, about 40% of the panels we need to complete Badger Hollow 2 in Paris are in Chicago warehouse, and another 30% of the panels are about in the U.S. So we have the panels. We\u2019re just working to get them through the paperwork to get through the Border Patrol. We\u2019re starting to see a few panels, not ours, but a few panels get through the Border Patrol, so we\u2019re optimistic. But we have them in the States, and we just need to get them released yet. So, we think all the paperwork is good. We\u2019ve gone back and worked with our suppliers and worked with our developers to get everything lined up. It\u2019s just a matter of getting it through the final Border Patrol. But, we\u2019re already -- the sites serve -- the one site is ready, and we have a lot of the panels right here, just a few -- 100 miles away to be able to put them on. We just got to get them out. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then, last... Gale Klappa : They\u2019re in a hermetically sealed warehouse in Chicago. Michael Sullivan : Got it. Okay. And then last one, just flipping to the Samson acquisition, I know like none of these projects are exactly alike. But just on like a $1 per KW basis, this actually was one of like the cheaper deals that you\u2019ve done. Is that just a function of location, current environment, anything like nuance there that we should be thinking about? Gale Klappa : No. I think when you look at the appropriate purchase price, one of the big factors is the particular elements of the offtake agreement or the purchase power agreement, in this case with AT&T. So, that was a heavy determinant of the overall value that we saw in the project. Xia, anything you want to add to that? Xia Liu : No, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s a function of the PPA purchase price. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome, Michael. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Gale Klappa : So, Durgesh, you\u2019re going to sing fly Eagles, fly for us? Durgesh Chopra : That\u2019ll put you to sleep. I\u2019m not a great singer. But I will be singing after they actually win in a few weeks here. Okay. Thanks, Gale, for giving me time. I was going to ask you a question on the price of Samson 1 versus Maple Flats that you\u2019ve answered. So, that\u2019s good. Maybe just -- are you seeing -- we\u2019ve heard a lot about transformer shortage and just general material storages. I think you talked about the panels already being in-house. But can you just generally talk about materials, construction materials? And are you seeing some tightness there, specifically issues with transformers or any other equipment? Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question, Durgesh. Let me say this. A couple of years ago, we actually were in a position where we thought we would be very protective of our customers and our franchise if we did a double order of transformers. And that has served us pretty well. I think everyone is a bit tight. It\u2019s kind of we feel reasonably in good shape with where we stand. Scott Lauber : We feel like we\u2019re in good shape. We\u2019ve been working with our suppliers every week. Probably the one that\u2019s across the industry is more of those pad-mount transformers. But we\u2019ve been working and we are able to continue with all our construction and our capital work. So, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any issues, but we\u2019re watching it very closely. Hopefully, things will loosen up here. But the pad-mount transformers along with some meter sets have been probably the tightest things for us, but we\u2019re watching everything. Gale Klappa : And so far, so good. Durgesh Chopra : I guess, are you sourced for the balance of the year in \u201824? Is that how we should think about it when you\u2019re talking about the two-year kind of preorder? Scott Lauber : I think we\u2019re sourced through the year next year. What we did is some of our larger transformers that we need for substations, we went out and did some ordered way ahead of time, just to get into the queue. Those are the transformers that Gale was talking about. So, there\u2019s different sizes of transfers. Those real large ones, we get out there a year ago to put orders out ahead of time. Gale Klappa : And Durgesh, one of the reasons we did what Scott just described is the large economic development projects that were coming to fruition here. For example, I mean, we\u2019ve talked a lot about [indiscernible] but they are up and running and ramping up and Komatsu was finished and is now operating their new headquarters and manufacturing -- state-of-the-art manufacturing plant. So a number of the major economic development projects, which we knew would require large transformer sets we prepared for that in advance, which was really good. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Guys, thanks so much. I appreciate the time. Gale Klappa : Go Eagles. Durgesh Chopra : For sure. Go Eagles. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : First question is another one on Samson 1 here. It\u2019s early, but how do you think about the potential to invest in some or all of the next five phases? I mean that alone could be more than half of the five-year budget, or would you prefer to diversify your projects? Gale Klappa : Well, we\u2019ve really followed a philosophy of diversification. However, you never say never. We will see if the performance on Samson 1 is as we expected, and we\u2019re certainly open to looking at portions of future phases. But we have not made any decision on that whatsoever. It\u2019s certainly a possibility. And I\u2019m confident if we wanted to be a continued partner in any of those future phases, we would have the opportunity to do so. But, we\u2019ll balance that against what we see as the performance in Samson 1 and against our thinking about diversification, both solar, wind and region. Andrew Weisel : Do we know the timing of when Samson 2 is going to be at that decision point? Gale Klappa : It\u2019s under construction now, but I don\u2019t have an in-service date, but we know it\u2019s under construction now. So my guess is it\u2019s in the next 12 to 18 months max. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Next question on a similar front here. The year-over-year EPS walk shows positive $0.10 from PTCs. Are you able to quantify what percent of your total earnings relate to renewable tax credits at the Energy Infrastructure segment? Gale Klappa : Xia might be able to give you that. I can -- we can tell you what the earnings from our renewable investments were. We can start at $0.28, which is what we delivered in terms of the investments in our infrastructure projects. So, you wrap in the PTCs, you wrap in other revenues. And Xia, we got to about $0.28 a share for 2022 from the Infrastructure segment. Xia Liu : Correct. And we don\u2019t have the breakdown between PTCs and operating revenue, but the majority of the $0.28 million is from PTCs. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Thanks. Then one last one, if I can. The new battery pilot sounds exciting, but I\u2019m interested in your other science project, the hydrogen blending. You briefly mentioned on the last call that initial results were encouraging. Are you able to give us any additional updates on that project? Gale Klappa : Yes, they were very encouraging. And within a matter of weeks now, I think before the end of February, the Electric Power Research Institute, which really was the main technical organization helping to drive the project and helping to analyze the project. The Electric Power Research Institute will have a full report available on all the analysis. And we expect that report to be out in the next few weeks. But, again, very encouraged from the standpoint of both the efficiency of what we saw, no degradation of the equipment, and you name it, and it was -- as Scott said, the engineers were giddy. And that\u2019s scary actually when the engineers\u2026 Scott Lauber : Enjoy the project. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Good afternoon, Gale. Gale Klappa : Anthony\u2026 Anthony Crowdell : Absolutely. I saw some photos of you with Aaron Rodgers in a basketball game recently in one of the local papers. Gale Klappa : Yes. I was apparently seated next to him and some other folks. It was -- for some reason or another, when you\u2019re sitting next to Aaron, there are a lot of pictures being taken. Anthony Crowdell : It was all of you, Aaron was very fortunate. I own one share, so I hope he wasn\u2019t out that late. I hate keeping my employees out late there. Just more housekeeping questions, I guess one on Illinois. I think you spoke earlier on the rate case. And maybe I think if I characterize it correctly, it\u2019s good maybe to go through an entire case and the commission, and I think parties will see how much the company has invested. I\u2019m just curious when you see the timing of the QIP rider, expires, then also on the electric side, which I know you guys are not there, but on the electric side, the formula rate plan expired. So the commission right now has 6 or 7 pretty sizable rate cases. Does that make settlements maybe more likely to happen given the workload there? Gale Klappa : It\u2019s very difficult to say one way or another. But certainly, the commission will have a solid amount of work to get through. I believe every natural gas distribution company of any size has filed their rate case in Illinois and of course, as you say, the formula rate plans and the changes under the legislation on the electric side. So there will be a lot cooking in Illinois this particular year. Whether that leads to more settlements, I think it\u2019s way too early to tell. But clearly, the Illinois has had a track record of settlements. We actually, I believe, had a very positive settlement with our North Shore case just a year or so ago. So, it\u2019s certainly not out of the realm of possibility, Anthony, at all. Anthony Crowdell : Got it. And if I stay with the gas business, at least Henry Hub gas prices have really declined from the start of the winter until now, and we\u2019re still have a couple more weeks of winter left. I mean, is the company able to maybe capture that in customer bills through contracts? I\u2019m just wondering, as maybe the company\u2019s buying, more hedging process kicked up with these lower prices to mitigate customer bill impact. Gale Klappa : Well, we\u2019re clearly going to see -- I mean, gosh, I look today, and I think we\u2019re around 2.60 [ph] per million BTU is amazing compared to where we were just about two, three months ago. But if you look at -- particularly for our natural gas heating customers, we have a set commission-approved strategy where we basically -- in advance of the winter season, we basically do a third, a third, and a third; roughly a third of gas and storage, a third of financial hedging and a third on the spot market. So, the extent that third that\u2019s being purchased off the spot market is materially better, it\u2019s going to be helpful to customer bills. Scott Lauber : And we also have that process as we start thinking about next year as we put injection. So, we may be hedging a little bit right now, just following a very strict pattern to lock in some of those prices for next year. Gale Klappa : Exactly. And one thing that I would add to all of that is that when we filed our case for Peoples Gas in Illinois, and Scott mentioned this in his prepared remarks, just looking at the futures market for natural gas, we should be able to completely -- even with the rate increase in base rates, we should be able to completely offset that with lower commodity costs and keep customer bills flat in 2024 in Illinois. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then, if I just -- last question, I\u2019d say with costs. I\u2019m just curious, it seems -- obviously, WEC large corporation in our space. You\u2019ve been able to navigate a lot of the challenges of maybe higher rates, inflation headwinds. And is it the scale and size? I mean, how big of a factor is that navigating where some of the smaller utilities or smaller companies are really stumbling on navigating? I mean, is it that -- do you need that scale and size to handle these challenges? Gale Klappa : Anthony, it\u2019s a great question and my view would be we are in a scale business. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that. And I\u2019m going to ask Xia to give you one statistic that I think underscores the benefits of scale. If you look back to the -- as a starting point, to 2016, which would be the first full year after our acquisition of Integrys, so from 2016 to the end of \u201822, Xia will give you a statistic that will blow your mind. Xia Liu : I think Gale mentioned -- is thinking about the day-to-day O&M performance. You know we brought down over $300 million since the acquisition. The CAGR from 2016 all the way to the projected 2023, I think is about 2.5% reduction a year projected. So at the same time, if you think about the asset base growth over the same period, it\u2019s been north of 7% a year. So, the growing rate base asset base, at the same time bringing down O&M. So, that\u2019s a pretty solid track record. Gale Klappa : It just gives you an example, Anthony, of the benefits of scale. Anthony Crowdell : Well, thanks so much. Thanks for the time. I\u2019m also not planning a dog anytime soon. I hope you guys have a great day. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Anthony. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with Hudson Bay Capital. Gale Klappa : Hello, Vedula. Vedula Murti : Good afternoon. How are you? Gale Klappa : We\u2019re good. How about you? Vedula Murti : I\u2019m okay. A question\u2026 Gale Klappa : No, no, no, no. Vedula, I keep wanting you to say wonderful and award winning. You know that. Vedula Murti : Great. Wonderful, award winning. I appreciate that. Thank you. Gale Klappa : All Right. Vedula Murti : Okay. With all the focus on affordability and the regularity of rate filings and rate increases over multiple years, associated with investments, et cetera. I\u2019m wondering if you can maybe -- the topic talk too much about is the rate design and whether in fact there is any room or any ability to kind of work on that to perhaps balance some misalignment or to like somehow perhaps make things perhaps broadly more affordable. I know that in the past, it was always the industrial, large customers, subsidize residential and those used to be the thing to want to work it back through cost of service. So, I\u2019m just wondering -- I wonder if you can kind of give us your thoughts on that. And secondarily, one of the other things is about the fixed charge versus variable and whether there\u2019s been a trend mostly to moving towards a much larger fixed charge and away from being volumetrically exposed? Is there any thought or any duration or philosophy around perhaps using that as a means to make things more balanced into affordability? Gale Klappa : Okay. Well, I will ask Scott to give his view on this as well. Let me start off with one thing that immediately comes to mind. We have been, I think, pretty innovative in trying to help on the whole affordability issue. In fact, in the prior rate case and then it will be actually improved coming out of this rate case, we started something called the LIFT program for low income individuals where if you stayed on a payment plan, there was actually some forgiveness of bill arrears. And that\u2019s been actually an example again of how we\u2019re trying to help and work on the whole affordability issue. So, that\u2019s one thing that comes to mind. And the other is, I\u2019m sure, as we continue to see adoption of EVs across the footprint, that we will be looking at time of use rates and things that can be helpful in terms of not adding to the peak demand and therefore, not adding to our investment cost because of the prevalence of -- as we continue to grow the prevalence of EVs. Scott? Scott Lauber : You\u2019re exactly right. Looking at like time of use rates has been very helpful, especially as people are starting to get the EVs and they charge at night. And we\u2019re always looking at other opportunities, and we had -- we\u2019ve added in the past year some real-time market pricing programs, too, to encourage economic development. So, we really continue to evaluate what\u2019s good for the state of Wisconsin and our customers. Gale Klappa : Hope that\u2019s helpful. Vedula Murti : I appreciate it. Thank you. Gale Klappa : You\u2019re welcome. All right, folks. Well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for taking part. Always enjoy the discussions with you. And if you have any additional questions, feel free to call Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Thank you, everybody, so long. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group\u2019s Conference Call for First Quarter 2023 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. The replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Thank you very much. Live from the Heartland. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we review our results for our first quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team, who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 a share. Weather was a major factor in our lower results for the quarter. We saw one of the mildest winters in the history of the upper Midwest. For example, it was the second warmest first quarter in Milwaukee since 1891. However, we're confident in our plan for the remainder of the year and we're reaffirming our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share for the full-year. This assumes normal weather going forward. And as always, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. Switching gears now, the work on our ESG progress plan continues at a steady pace. It's the largest five-year investment plan in our history totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. The plan is based on projects that are low-risk and highly executable. And as we look to the future, it's clear that the megatrend of decarbonization and the need for even greater reliability will drive investment plans that are lost and strong. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in a moment, but I'm pleased to report that just since last December, the Wisconsin Commission has approved more than $1 billion of new capital investment by our companies. As we've discussed, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year from 2023 through 2027 and we fully expect to fund our capital plan without any need for new equity. Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We have good news from the latest data in Wisconsin. In March, the unemployment rate came in at 2.5%, that's a record low for the state and well below the national average. And we continue to see major developments in the area. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Microsoft announced that it plans to create a new data center campus in our region with an initial investment of $1 billion. This data center complex will be built South of Milwaukee in the technology park that is also being developed by Foxconn. Microsoft will purchase a 315 acre parcel in area three of the park. Local approvals have been received and we expect Microsoft to close on the land purchase on or before the 31st of July. In the meantime, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead with planning and design work. The decision by Microsoft underscores the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and positions us very well for more growth in the technology sector. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. New rates have been in effect for our Wisconsin utilities since the start of the year. As expected, we're planning to file a limited re-opener for 2024 later this quarter. The filing will address the recovery of capital investments for projects going into service this year and in 2024. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration. The request will be quite modest and we expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The next step will be for the commissioned staff and interveners to file their direct testimony on May 9, hearings are scheduled for early August. After nine years without a rate case at People's Gas, we're making these requests for 2024 to support our investment in key infrastructure. And with lower natural gas prices, we project customer bills will be flat with 2022. We also have rate reviews and progress at Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. We filed in Minnesota last November and interim rates went into effect January 1. I'm pleased to announce that we received a settlement with parties that would result at a 7.1% increase in base rates, that's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. This settlement is subject to commission approval, which we expect in the next several months. And in March, we filed for a base rate increase of 9.1% at Michigan Gas Utilities for 2024. This application is primarily driven by our capital investments supporting safety and reliability. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. Red Barn Wind Park went to service last month the project is providing 82 megawatts of clean energy capacity to our Wisconsin customers. And as Gale noted, we received three significant approvals for the Wisconsin Commission since last December. For the Darien Solar-Battery Park, West Riverside Energy Center and Koshkonong Solar Battery Park. We discussed the Darien approval last quarter and as you recall, the Solar Park is planned to go in service in 2024. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. In February, we received approval for our purchase of 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity for approximately $102 million. We expect to close this purchase by the end of the month. We have an option to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity, and we have planned to exercise that option later this year. We also received approval for our purchase of Koshkonong Solar Battery Park. With plans for 300 megawatts of solar capacity and 165 megawatts of battery storage, we will own 90% of the project with an expected investment of $585 million. We project the solar portion of this facility to go into service in 2025. We also continue on the Badger Hollow 2 solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. While Badger Hollow has received some of the solar panels, the remaining panels for projects are currently in Chicago going through the customs process. Assuming timely release of the panels, we expect these solar parks to go into service late this year or early next year. For the Paris and Koshkonong projects, we're evaluating the timing of the battery investments. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. Outside of utilities, we continue to make progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC infrastructure segment. In February, we completed our acquisition of a Sapphire Sky Wind farm, now in service in Illinois. As a reminder, that project offers 250 megawatts of capacity in total, and we own a 90% share. Also in February, we added an 80% ownership in the Samson 1 solar project located in Northeast Texas. The project has a capacity of 250 megawatts. As disclosed previously, Samson 1 suffered storm damage at the beginning of March, but we expect no significant bottom-line impact for the property losses. The project is currently producing energy at about 70% level and improving every day as we continue to restore the site. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financial results and our second quarter guidance. Xia? Xia Liu : Thank you, Gale. Our 2023 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share decreased $0.18 per share, compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on page 12. I'll walk-through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, our earnings were $0.09 lower, compared to the first quarter of \u201822. Rate based growth contributed $0.22 to earnings, driven by continued investment in our ESG progress plan. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities, as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. This favorable margin impact from rate base growth was more than offset by a number of factors. First, as Gale noted, we experienced one of the mildest winters in history, which drove a $0.12 decrease in earnings, compared to the first quarter of last year. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, depreciation and amortization interest, day-to-day O&M, taxes and other, drove a combined $0.19 negative variance. Before I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather normalized sales. You can find our sales information on page nine of the earnings package. I'd like to remind you that weather normalization is not a perfect sign. Extreme warm weather in the first quarter may not be fully reflected in our weather normalized data. Having said that, weather normal retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding natural gas used for power generation, were down 1%. However, residential usage, again on a weather normal basis grew 0.9%. That was ahead of our forecast. Weather normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine were 1.9% lower. Residential usage was relatively flat, compared to last year. Now at our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings were $0.01 lower in the first quarter of \u201923, compared to the first quarter of \u201922. Production tax credits were higher by $0.03 quarter-over-quarter, resulting from acquisitions of renewable generation projects. This increase was largely offset by a pickup that we recorded in the first quarter last year from the resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segment decreased $0.08, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense and a pickup recorded in the first quarter \u201822 from our investment in the clean energy fund. These items were partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M. Looking now at the cash flow statement on page six of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $281 million. The mild winter and timing of recovery of commodity costs contributed to this decrease. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of \u201823, an $884 million increase from the first quarter of \u201822. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Whitewater Natural Gas Power Generation facility in our Wisconsin segment, as well as the Sapphire Sky Wind farm and Samson 1 solar facility in our infrastructure segment. In closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we're reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we're implementing a variety of initiatives. As a result, we now expect our day-to-day O&M to be 2% to 3% higher than 2022 versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% higher. I will also add that largely due to timing of O&M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in the second-half of this year to be materially better than the second-half of 2022. For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.83 to $0.85 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.91 per share in the second quarter last year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Now we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please, go ahead. Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, Shar. Are you still using those pillowcases? Shar Pourreza : Yes. But they don't match the rest of the house though, that's the issue. How are you doing? Gale Klappa : We're fine. How about you? Shar Pourreza : Good, not too bad, not too bad. So, Gale, a quick one here. So, like half a dozen utilities have issued these like hybrid convertible notes at pretty attractive rates. I think in some cases, it's like 200 basis points of interest rate savings. There's obviously no equity credit there. So, you've seen it even being utilized by some peers that don't need equity. I just want to get your sense from you [Indiscernible] like whether you see -- I guess, any value with these hybrid securities to help fund the five-year plan. Does it make sense? I mean, obviously, we're waiting for your cue to be released to see if there's any kind of language around it, but\u2026 Gale Klappa : Yes. A good question, Shar. And clearly, there are a number of companies in the sector even too today announced that have announced the use of this cash pay convert product. We've taken a good hard look at it and let me just say this, if we found -- as we go through the course of the remainder of 2023, if we found that it was really advantageous for us, we would certainly take a hard look. But we're more than halfway, Shar, through our debt issuance plan for 2023 and doing very well against our budget. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes, not much to add, we're very aware of the transactions. We understand the pros and cons. And at this time, we really have not made any decision as whether cash pay convertible notes fit those -- fit our criteria. But we've done quite a bit financing so far and we've done really well, better than planned rate, so\u2026 Shar Pourreza : And then just Xia, I don't want to front-run the queue, but is there -- will there be any language around looking at hybrids potentially as an option to fund the plan or not? Gale Klappa : Shar, are you talking about hybrids or are you talking about the cash pay converts or both? Shar Pourreza : These cash pay converts or hybrids or whatever you want to call them at this point? Gale Klappa : I don't think there's any language that we're planning in the queue of the\u2026 Xia Liu : No, we haven't planned that at this point. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. I appreciate that. And then just lastly on Illinois, obviously, the cases were filed in January. It's not a lot of data points since then, but gas prices have actually have come off, which I think hopefully will help the case, it\u2019s a tailwind. Any thoughts, I guess, Gale, at this point on potentially settling how has the dialog been going? Is there anything we should be thinking about? Gale Klappa : Yes. Way, way too early to even think about or contemplate settlement in the process in Illinois. The process was going along very smoothly. I think the next steps, as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, the next step will be staff and intervenor testimony on May 9. But so far, we're responding to data requests. The process in Illinois is going exactly as historically they've gone. And to your point about commodity costs moving in our favor, they moved even more in our favor since we filed the case. But long story short, even with the base increase that we're seeking, you combine that with much lower commodity costs, and we expect customer bills to be flat even granting a full base rate increase for 2024 -- for bills in 2024. So, again, we think that's very good news. And when you look at just the basic facts of what we're -- what we filed, this will be, as you may recall, the first base rate increase for Peoples Gas since we acquired the company, first base rate increase actually in nine years. And our O&M is about $60 million a year lower than when we actually acquired the company in 2015. So, a pretty good story. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Terrific, guys. Thanks. Congrats and a great execution so far. Appreciate it. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. How are you doing? Gale, no dog yet, but we'll be able to -- we're in the mix. Gale Klappa : You stole my question. No dog yet, okay. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Trying to free up some air, you know. Lies to you. Listen, let me follow-up where Shar was going with that. So, with respect to the Peoples case here, I'm just talking a little bit about the future of gas, but also just the CapEx and just some of the scrutiny on bill pressures. How do you think about moderating bills? I mean, obviously gas has rolled over. Any mitigating items, circumstances that we should be thinking about on that front? And then separately, how do you think in response to some of the -- it has been some OpEx out there, et cetera., any thoughts as to how you tackle, sort of, the longer-term versus the here-and-now of investing without the QIP in place in the traditional sense? Gale Klappa : Yes. Good question, Julien. And let me know, I want to help you name the dog. So, let me know. On the QIP program and the investment in the safety modernization program, the pipe upgrade program that we've been carrying out in Chicago. Let me first say that we really welcome the public debate and the policy decision that the Illinois Commerce Commission will make about the future of the program. And just to put it in perspective, on average, we've invested about $280 million a year in upgrading the pipe network under the City of Chicago, which is, by the way, one of the oldest, and now, most deteriorated natural gas delivery networks in the country. So, long story short, we're almost 36% complete with the pipe upgrade plan, and again, investing about $280 million a year. Now, those who think we should do something different are banking on electrification. So, the bets you would have to make to not in some form continue the program is that Chicago can completely electrify in less than 15-years, because the independent study that the Illinois Commerce Commission has ordered and accepted, independent engineering study shows that more than 80% of the iron pipes in our delivery network under Chicago have a useful life left of 15-years. And then lastly -- or, 15 years or less. And then lastly, there are some who say, well, just patch the pipes. Julien, I'm telling you some of those pipes can't be patched. And when you look at the continued O&M that would be required to patch after patch after patch, it would not, in our estimation, save customers any money. So, we think there is overwhelming evidence here to continue the program. We would do so under our proposal as an annual base rate increase, if you will, to cover the cost of what we think is a very important program for both the immediate safety of Chicago, and then secondly, to preserve a long-term future where that delivery network could deliver, say, hydrogen or other no-carbon fuels to keep Chicago warm. So, I hope that response helps. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely does. Thank you, Gale. I appreciate it. I will give you naming rights indeed. If I can, though -- you bet you. With respect to the process, I want to come back to this super quickly. We've got a new ICC in place, et cetera., I mean, to the extent to which that you're looking for direction here, I mean, this rate case should be the right venue to think about the pace and the sort of the new vision on where things are going, right? There's not some other avenue, I'm just trying to think through the -- how the ICC wants to articulate a response to your proposed spending, if you will? It will [Technical Difficulty] Gale Klappa : Well, there are extensive, as you would expect, and we wanted to have this kind of dialog. We welcome this kind of dialog. But there are multiple data requests as there are in any rate review, but particularly there are data requests about the program, about the need for the program, about the future of the program, et cetera. So, I agree with you. I think this is the proper forum to have that policy decision made. And everything is proceeding under the normal schedule, if you will, of data requests. And now, as we said earlier, the next formal step would be May 9 when we expect the staff and intervenor testimony. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, thank you for color. [Technical Difficulty] and we\u2019ll look next week, right? You take care. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thanks, Julien. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Chase. Please, go ahead. Gale Klappa : Jeremy, are you moving to Republic Bank or, you know\u2026 Jeremy Tonet : Nothing to say there. Gale Klappa : There you go. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to kind of come back, I guess, to the weather impacts as you -- as happened in the quarter and the offsets there. Should we think about this as just kind of O&M being the main tool to -- for offset over the balance of the year? And just wondering if you could quantify or give any more color there and how that might shape up across the year. I think you said in the back half, it kind of lightens up a bit. So, any more color there could be helpful. Gale Klappa : Yes. We'd be happy to do that and will ask Xia to give you some specifics. Let me frame a couple of things for you. First of all, we've got a pretty experienced management team, we've been down this road before. So, we have a pretty well tested playbook, and the playbook has been implemented. There are O&M initiatives in every group of the company, every department, every section. They have plans and they have goals. So, a big part of it obviously is related to day-to-day operation and maintenance costs. Another big positive for us, again, compared to our budget and our forecast is really the interest cost savings that we're seeing. And then I'm going to ask Xia and Scott to kind of briefly walk you through the difference that we see in Q3 and Q4 of this year, compared to Q3 and Q4 of last year when we were deep into our sharing bands with customers. So, Xia, why don't we start off with you, and some specifics? And then we'll let -- we'll ask Scott to talk about the sharing bands that really impacted Q3 and Q4 last year. Xia Liu : Sure. So, Q1 weather was about $0.12 deficit as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So, we've identified O&M reduction target that can offset $0.04, $0.05, $0.06 of that. We also built some conservative financing assumptions in the plan. So, in terms of issuing debt at rates lower than the plan or continued execution later this year, we expect the financing savings to be $0.05 to $0.06 also. So, between those two items, we could offset the Q1 weather deficit. But we also have other initiatives we're looking at beyond those two items. Scott Lauber : Sure. And then when you think about the last half of the year, you have to remember the last several years we've been very fortunate to be in -- actual be into a sharing band where we're sharing with customers. I think last year, we were able to reduce our fuel request about $54 million. So, that's quite a bit when you think about charges in the last half of the year. And last half, remember, we had warmer-than-normal weather, so we were able to accelerate or do some additional spending for our customers. So, we incurred additional O&M costs plus the sharing band. So, that was meaningful for the last half of the year, compared to we see this year coming -- shaping up. Gale Klappa : And to Scott's point, we obviously don't see ourselves into the sharing bands with customers this year. So, I think in terms of basically $54 million of costs that won't reappear in the third and fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the second-half of 2022. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. Thanks. And just shifting a bit to solar. And I know that you touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks as it relates to the solar supply chain. But just wondering, I guess, thoughts on ongoing congressional efforts to revoke the President's two years solar tariff suspension and just wondering if you have any thoughts you could share there or just on the supply chain in general? Gale Klappa : Well, my understanding is that President Biden said he would veto any effort to undo that particular initiative. So, I'm not sure that one's going anywhere, but in the meantime, as Scott indicated in his prepared remarks, for our Badger Hollow II solar project in Wisconsin for our regulated utility, and for our Paris Solar Battery project, again, for our Wisconsin utilities, Scott, we got all the solar panels we need hanging in warehouse in Chicago? Scott Lauber : They're in the warehouse in Chicago, we're just working with customs to get them out of that warehouse. And of course, for the future projects, we're looking at other alternatives including U.S. potential options available in the future to source those future projects that the commission has approved. Gale Klappa : Jeremy, Scott and I went down to that warehouse one night, but the Doberman wouldn't let us in. So, we know all of those panels are there. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one last quick one if I could, as it relates to transmission and future MISO tranches maybe, kind of, taking shape in the not-too-distant future here. Just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on permitting, reform or what the MISO outlook could mean for WEC down the road? Gale Klappa : Don't see much of any progress on permitting reform at this stage of the game. But again, as MISO works its way through all of the stakeholder process, on Tranche 2 Phase 1, the early indications are quite favorable in terms of the investment opportunity being even greater than what we saw in basically Tranche 1. And then in addition to that, I mentioned the major economic development project that was just announced with Microsoft, any particular upside on transmission or generation needs related to that Microsoft project would be incremental to the plan and not in the current plan. And I'm guessing, there may be some additional transmission need coming out of that project. Scott? Scott Lauber : No, that's correct, Gale. And also a reminder, Tranche 1 was using a lot of existing right of ways. So we're very happy using existing right of ways to be able to get that construction started in earlier time frame, in that \u201825, \u201826 time frame. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Jeremy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please, go ahead. Gale Klappa : Hey, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey, Gale. How are you? Gale Klappa : We're good. How about you? Michael Sullivan : Okay, yes. No, doing great. Maybe just back to the O&M. So, understand, it was going to tick up a little bit this year. Now you're kind of pulling that back to help offset the weather. As we think beyond 2023, how should we think about the trajectory? I know you have a track record of bringing it down, and this year was kind of the first time in a while it was set to the step up? Gale Klappa : Yes. I think when you look at the near-term future past 2023, we're going to be seeing another chunk of O&M reduction related to the planned retirements. And just as a reminder, we have four older units at are Oak Creek site, Units 5, 6, 7, and 8. And Units 5 and 6 are scheduled for retirement next year, and then Units 7 and 8 in 2025. And along with that, the retirement, will come a substantial chunk of O&M reduction. Scott? Scott Lauber : No, you're exactly right. As we put on those retirements, O&M will go down. But remember, the driver for the O&M increases this year was -- as we put in new plants into the system. We added a lot of capital over this last year and to run those new plants including the new rice units that we're putting in service and also the plants and the wacky infrastructure, all that's additional O&M. So, really supporting capital investments. Gale Klappa : And one other thought adding on to what Scott is saying, there's another benefit to the investments that we're making that are coming online, particularly, the solar investments that we're in the final stages of completion. Those investments, when they're online and producing energy, actually replace fuel costs. So, in addition to O&M chunks of savings coming forward here from the retirement of older coal-fired units, we're also going to see reductions in fuel costs, simply because obviously with solar and wind, the fuel is free. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. And just related to that, to the extent that we see any shifting in timing of the solar with supply chain issues and the panels and the warehouse and all that, how do you kind of react to that? Is the risk that -- are you tying that to the coal shutdown retirement in terms of just earning on those assets and rate base, or are there other things you have to move around? Just what are kind of the other implications across the business to the extent that your solar projects get pushed down a little bit? Gale Klappa : Well, to answer the second part of your question on retirements of the four older coal-fired units, we don't see any change in that schedule. That, I believe, will continue to be the 2024 and 2025 retirement dates for each of those two units. And then in terms of the potential further delays, again, we have to get clearance here and we've got a plan B if we can't get clearance to finish the solar projects. But remember, these are regulated projects, the commission is very, very supportive of the need for those projects. And Scott, we're earning AFUDC during the construction period. Scott Lauber : Correct. And we're continuing to the construction, so they are site-ready when the solar panels get released. So, Paris and Badger Hollow II construction is pretty well done. And Badger Hollow II, we just need the solar panels, and Paris is moving along nicely. So, those panels are ready, it won't take long to pop them up. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thanks a lot. Gale Klappa : Take care, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please, go ahead. Gale Klappa : Wow. You've got the Jersey number eight on, Durgesh? Durgesh Chopra : I don't know about that, Gale. Gale Klappa : I know. I know. Still die-hard Eagle fan, right? Durgesh Chopra : It still hurts, it still hurts. Gale Klappa : I'm sorry. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. We'll be back the next year. So, just, Gale, I wanted to go back to the reopener. We've had a ton discussion here as you make the filing. I think Scott mentioned in his opening remarks that it's not for ROE for equity layer. Maybe can you just talk about the projects that you will be filing for. Am I right in thinking about that these projects are already approved, so you're not necessarily seeking for prudency of those projects? And then to the extent that you can sort of help us frame what CapEx are we looking at, as you file -- as you make these filings in the quarter? Gale Klappa : Sure. I will ask Scott to help out as well. So, you are correct. This limited reopener, as defined in the rate order, does not -- I mean, the ROE and the equity layer are set and they're not up for reconsideration. There's roughly -- and yes, you are correct, all of the projects that we will be filing for recovery in this limited reopener have already been approved by the commission. So, that is absolutely correct. And Scott, it's about $1 billion of capital that will be coming in, if I recall correctly, into that reopener? Scott Lauber : Yes. It's approximately that, I don't have the exact number at my fingertips. But when you think about the reopener, it's projects like we talked about Riverside was approved now that $102 million we'll put that into the reopener. The Western rice units, those are going to be in for a full-year, so that'll be part of the reopener. So, some of these are full-year, some of these are actually part of the year capital projects. Gale Klappa : And LNG, one of our LNG projects. Scott Lauber : Yes. The LNG projects. So, it's really across electric and gas, just truing up with the capital additions. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thanks, Scott. And then you've previously talked about O&M savings to be included as part of that request. Is that also part of this limited reopener filing or could be a part of the limited reopener filing? Scott Lauber : Sure. The real -- the O&M piece is really the retirement for that Oak Creek 5 and 6, those older Oak Creek units. Remember last year, we filed a case and then we extended them. And now what we're doing is closing those units at the end of May here of 2024. So, that'll be the O&M reduction that we put in the actual order for us to factor that into the case. Gale Klappa : And, Durgesh, the largest O&M reduction -- Scott is exactly right. The largest O&M reduction from the closure of the Oak Creek units really will come when all four units are retired, because we won't be retiring the environmental control operation at that site for those older units until all for are offline. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's super-helpful, guys. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Take care, Durgesh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please, go ahead. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good afternoon, everybody. First question on timing of fuel cost. I know that's minus $0.07 in the 1Q waterfall. What's your expectation for the full-year based on current curves? Do you expect that to fully reverse? And if so, when? Xia Liu : Andrew, this is Xia. We -- that's purely timing. We expect that to recover in the second quarter and throughout the third and fourth quarter. Remember that last year, like Gale mentioned, we booked quite a bit of fuel expense, because of the sharing band and we don't expect that to happen. So, we see a pickup in fuel in in terms of impact on earnings. Gale Klappa : So, purely timing. We'll see a second half turnaround. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Thanks. And then on usage. Xia, if you could elaborate a little bit on the demand trends. I think you said residential gas came in better than expected adjusting for weather. But on the electric side, all customer classes were down. How much of that is just the noise around the extreme weather, or do you see any notable changes in demand trends? Xia Liu : Yes. A lot of accepted noise around weather normalization, like I said. So, just to put it in perspective, the weather-normalized residential sales met our forecasted expectations. So, those are the higher-margin segments. And on the C&I front, we -- just a reminder, we have a very diverse mix of industries, we call provide essential services like food, paper, plastic, processing, and many of which had a really good growth in the first quarter. And we don't have exposure to lots of automobile or oil and gas industry. So, we feel really good about the industry mix. And we really haven't seen any trends of any potential recession in our service territory. So, we track about a little over 100 large customers regularly. Therefore, that contributed to almost half of the negative variance in the first quarter year-over-year. And two of those were down substantially year-over-year, because of non-economic reasons. So, one had a fire, the other had an outbreak. So, we expect those to return to normal through the rest of the year. So -- and again, weather normal noise played a role in these numbers. So, I wouldn't overreact to these numbers right now. Gale Klappa : Yes, Andrew, just to build on what Xia is saying, when you look at the temperatures across Q1, they were basically two standard deviations away from normal. And I can just tell you, not only for our company, but for the industry as a whole, and for those of you who followed us a long time, you've heard me say this a gazillion times, I mean, the weather normalization techniques are far more precise than accurate and the further you get away from in terms of standard deviations from the norm, the less reliable the weather normalization techniques are. So, again, just as a general caveat, as Xia said, wouldn't read too much into Q1 numbers. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Just wanted to be sure. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : No, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please, go ahead. Gale Klappa : Hey, Anthony. Anthony Crowdell : Good afternoon, Gale. Gale Klappa : We've got a dog to name? Anthony Crowdell : I was thinking that warehouse Doberman. That may work for Julien. Gale Klappa : Hey, not a bad idea. I'll take all of your input on naming the dog for Julien. But, go ahead, Anthony. Anthony Crowdell : So, Andrew, Xia had just took my question on the recession and C&I sales. If I could just pivot and I think maybe some of your comments earlier on the iron piping in Chicago. I'm just curious, if we think back maybe 10-years ago or 15-years ago when we talk about nuclear generation, how we're getting rid of it, how we're getting rid of it, and then all of a sudden, we come to the realization of its importance and zero carbon, do you think we have a similar moment in gas LDC? And if we do, do you think that's going to be more dependent on its locations such as you bring up colder Midwest area that, hey, there is this recognition that if we wanted to retire it, we have to do it -- electrify within 15-years where that -- as we get closer to that, the parties realize how valuable the asset is? Gale Klappa : Yes, that's a great question, Anthony. And I do think there will be an epiphany moment. Don't know exactly when that epiphany moment will occur, but here are a couple of thoughts. The first is if you think you can electrify completely by, let's say, 15-years from now, you then have to take the next step and say, how are we going to build the generation that would be needed to replace gas heating. And what kind of generation would that be? Well, think about when gas heating is needed the most. It's the heavy cold winter days in January and February, right? So, how much solar could you count on particularly in the Midwest in January and February? How much wind could you count on in January and February? And guess what, you end up clunking into the plan a tremendous amount of gas-fired power generation. When people start working through that equation, I think there will be quite an epiphany moment. I think that's part of it. And then the other is, as we continue to see the evolution of hydrogen hubs and as we continue to see more and more cost effectiveness from hydrogen under the IRA, I mean, some gas utilities are already beginning to blend hydrogen with natural gas. We're beginning to blend -- in fact, this summer, we will begin blending RNG, renewable natural gas, into our network. So, I think as people begin to think through past-the-bumper sticker. Yes, you're going to see an epiphany moment about how valuable having that resource will be as we transition to a low or no-carbon future. I mean, think about it another way. We have got to get this transition right to a no-carbon future. And if we sacrifice reliability on that transition, it will delay the transition for many, many, many years. So, we're back to all of the above and we're back to, I think, we will have a moment where everybody recognizes the practical approach to this and the safe approach to this. Anthony Crowdell : Great, Gale, as always. Thanks so much. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Anthony. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please, go ahead. Ashar Khan : Hi. How are you guys doing? Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a small one. Xia, why are we down quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter? Could you just help me with the variances which you expect in the second quarter? Xia Liu : Sure, I'd be happy to. So, financing costs are expected to be higher compared to Q2 last year. So, that's a big driver. There is plus and minuses, but we do have rate base growth that's better than last year. Fuel is expected to be better than last year, but largely offset by financing costs. Ashar Khan : Okay. Thank you so much. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Well, folks, I think that concludes -- oops, is there more? I'm sorry. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to you, Mr. Klappa, for any concluding remarks. Gale Klappa : There we go. I jumped again. Thank you. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating as always. And if you have additional questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka, 414-221-4639. Thank you, everybody. Take care.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.92 a share. After a down first quarter marked by one of the warmest winters on record, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and we're firmly on track for a strong 2023. Today, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. The range is $4.58 to $4.62 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather going forward. As always, we're focused on the fundamentals of our business : Financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. During the second quarter, we also continued to move forward on our major initiatives, including the investments outlined in our $20.1 billion ESG progress plan. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. We expect to quadruple the amount of renewable generation for our regulated customers, add highly efficient gas field capacity to ensure reliability and continue to harden our delivery networks. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in just a moment. As a reminder, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive growth in earnings per share of 6.5% to 7% a year. And as we've discussed, there is no need to issue equity for this $20.1 billion five-year plan. Now over the past few months, many of you have asked about the trajectory of our next five-year plan. Our updated plan will cover the period 2024 through 2028. Of course, if growth in demand for capacity and energy drives our next capital plan significantly higher, then we'll evaluate all our financing options. In addition to incremental debt and refinancing opportunities, our options could include accessing the equity market through our dividend reinvestment plans, employee benefit plans and at-the-market programs. I would stress that at this point, we do not see the need for any block equity offering. Again, as a reminder, any equity need would be driven by growth and would support our long-term growth projections. As you would expect, we're on schedule with the development of our next five-year plan, and as usual, we'll share the details with you in the fall. Now let's take a brief look, we'll switch gears and take a brief look at our regional economy. We're still seeing a very strong labor market in Wisconsin. In June, the state added 7,000 private sector jobs. The unemployment rate came in at 2.5%, well below the national average, and the labor force participation rate rose for the fourth straight month in Wisconsin to 65.3%. Very solid numbers. We're also encouraged by the pipeline of economic activity in our region. Last quarter, you heard that Microsoft plans to make an initial investment of $1 billion to create a new data center campus. This new complex will be built south of Milwaukee, in the Wisconsin Innovation Park where Foxconn is located. Microsoft has purchased 315 acres in Area 3 of the park and is moving full speed ahead. In fact, earthwork at the site began just a few days ago. So along with American Transmission Company, we're working closely, in fact, on a weekly basis with Microsoft to determine the full extent of the energy infrastructure that will be needed to serve this development. We're excited about supporting Microsoft as the company moves forward with a major technology investment, and we'll update you as the planning proceeds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments and on our operations. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. In May, we filed a limited reopener to set 2024 rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The filings address the recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service this year and in 2024. These are renewable facilities, RICE generation and LNG reliability investments. The projects have already been approved by the Wisconsin Commission. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. We expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. After nine years without a base rate case at Peoples Gas, we're making these requests for 2024 to support our investments in critical infrastructure. In mid-July, the staff filed its rebuttal testimony, recommending a 9.83% return on equity and an equity layer of 50.83% for Peoples Gas. This was consistent with the initial recommendations from the staff. We expect a final decision by the end of the year. And moving to the other states, we are very pleased that we have reached a settlement agreement in our rate reviews at both Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. The Minnesota Commission is considering a settlement that would provide a 7.1% increase in base rates. As a quick reminder, that\u2019s based at a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. And we\u2019re pleased to update you that in Michigan we have reached a unanimous settlement and the details will be made public later this week. We expect final commissioned approval by the end of the year. Meanwhile, we\u2019re continuing progress on a number of regulatory \u2013 regulated capital projects. At the beginning of June, we closed on our first option of West Riverside Energy Center for $95 million. This adds 100 megawatts of efficient combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. As you recall, this plant is in operation and the purchase price was based on book value. And in the next few weeks, we plan to file a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option. We also put 128 megawatts of new natural gas generation online last month. As you recall, we invested $170 million to build this generation at our existing Western power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The facility uses seven reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them, race units. Elsewhere in the state work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris and Darien solar-battery parks. The Badger Hollow II site has begun receiving panels using non-Chinese polysilicon. Also, we continue to work on securing custom release of panels from a bonded warehouse in Chicago and we\u2019re still expecting Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year with Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work has begun on the Darien solar facility, which is planned to go into service in 2024. We\u2019ll keep you posted and updated on future developments. With that, I\u2019ll turn you back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott thanks very much. As you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. We believe this continues to rack our dividend growth in the top decile of our industry. We\u2019re targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We\u2019re right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and unveil our third quarter guidance. Xia, all yours. Xia Liu : Thanks, Gale. Our 2023 second quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I\u2019ll walk through the significant drivers. Our earnings from utility operations were $0.04 above the second quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.05 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These negative variances were more than offset in the quarter. Rate base growth contributed $0.11 cents to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utility as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. Additionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.05 and lower day-to-day O&M, taxes and other items resulted in a $0.02 improvement. Before I turn to earnings of the other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine were down 0.6% on a weather normal basis. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage, again on a weather normal basis was flat quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with our forecast. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.4%, which is ahead of forecast. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. This was largely driven by higher production tax credit as a result of the acquisition of renewable projects. Finally, you\u2019ll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segments decreased $0.05, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. This was partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M. Overall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.01 per share compared to last year and by $0.08 per share compared to the midpoint of our Q2 guidance. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat compared to the prior year. And total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion during the first half of 2023, an increase of more than $1 billion from the first half of 2022. This was primarily driven by acquisitions of generation projects in our Regulated and Infrastructure segment. Now, let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We\u2019re expecting a range of $0.88 to $0.90 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.96 per share in the third quarter last year, which included a positive $0.02 from weather and a $0.05 pickup related to the resolution of the MISO ROE complaint. As Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. As a reminder, largely due to timing of O&M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in Q4 to be materially better than Q4 of 2022. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Great, Xia. Thank you. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, we\u2019re ready now for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gale Klappa : Julien, before we start, I know \u2013 before we start, I know a great puppy trainer, so just let me know. Julien, are you still with us? Operator : Julien, your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Can you hear me now? Darius, go for it. Operator : We can. Gale Klappa : I thought I heard a dog barking in the back there, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: You can, sorry. Sorry about that. I don\u2019t know what happened. I thought I was on mute and off mute there, but then I got figured. Gale Klappa : I was just saying Julien \u2013 Julien, I was just saying that I know a great puppy trainer, so let me know. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, I\u2019m going to put it duly noted, sir, duly noted. I appreciate it. And by the way, congrats guys on all the updates here, really nicely done. I mean to that effect when you think about the settlement here in Michigan, how do you think about Illinois here and the ability to settle that out at least in part here as you get through the bulk of the hearings here in the near-term? Any opportunities and also any thoughts here on the legislative side going into 2024 for gas in Illinois as well? Gale Klappa : Okay. Appreciate the questions Julien, very much. Tackle the first one first and that\u2019s any potential or possibility for a rate settlement in our Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas cases in Illinois. So, as many of you know, the way the process really unfolds during normal rate reviews in Illinois, historically settlement windows really don\u2019t occur or really don\u2019t open until the administrative law judge has prepared a draft order. And if I remember correctly, the schedule for that administrative law judge draft order probably looks like late October, early November. Scott is agreeing that that\u2019s the case. So if there\u2019s a settlement opportunity, I think those discussions would take place probably in the November timeframe. So we\u2019ll see. Again, as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks the staff has reiterated its position with a 983 return on equity recommendation and an equity layer higher than what we have at Peoples Gas today. So I hope that responds to your question. And then as far as legislation related to gas in Illinois, we\u2019ll just have to see what takes place. But first things first, we continue to work on a positive resolution of the cases currently pending before the Illinois Commerce Commission. Hope that helps, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Certainly does. And then just quickly, if I can. Any thoughts about converts here? I mean, I heard your opening comments Gale and just curious if open to following the trend across the space? Gale Klappa : Yes. Well, as we look at our financing package that will be needed to support our new five-year capital plan, I mean, we\u2019ll look at it, it could be part of the mix, but again, I think it really depends upon the circumstances at the time. We haven\u2019t ruled it out. We\u2019ve followed the companies that have used this particular financing and I think you saw one announce today as a matter of fact. So, we haven\u2019t ruled it out. We haven\u2019t ruled it in but it certainly will be part of what we look at going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. We\u2019ll leave it there. I\u2019ll follow-up with you, Gale. All right, take care. Gale Klappa : Sounds good. Thanks Julien. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Gale Klappa : Shar you didn\u2019t do any permanent damage to those Porsches, did you? Shar Pourreza : You have to ask Southern company that, not me. Gale Klappa : Well, I noticed they\u2019re taking a charge this quarter, so I was a little worried about what you did down there. Shar Pourreza : We\u2019ll have to wait for that one. Gale, I know you mentioned the Microsoft Facility could be in service by late 2024, early 2025, which obviously that overlaps with your existing five-year plan through 2027. Should we be thinking about Microsoft related investment as something that\u2019s separate and incremental to the current five-year plan? Or is the focus on really maintaining that 7.7% asset based growth as you manage customer affordability? So, in other words, so could other base spending be pushed out to make room for Microsoft related spending? Thanks. Gale Klappa : Well, great question, Shar. And first off, I don\u2019t think really just given the magnitude of the construction that Microsoft seems to be planning, my own belief is we won\u2019t see the Microsoft campus in operation in 2024. I think that\u2019s just too much of a stretch. My guess, although the company is still very much in its \u2013 refining its plans my guess is fourth quarter 2025, early 2026 would be my guess for the first element of the plan that Microsoft is putting together to be operational. And then secondly to your question about would the Microsoft investment that we need to make to support their energy needs and reliability, would that investment be incremental to the plan? Absolutely incremental to the plan. There\u2019s no question about that because it was not in our current five-year plan. Although there are many moving pieces at this stage of the game. But I would just say this is a really positive exciting opportunity for a major new high tech investment in our state. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. So we shouldn\u2019t look at it as crowding out other base related spending as you\u2019re managing rates in the vehicle? Gale Klappa : No, absolutely. I mean, think about, it\u2019s a great question, Shar, but I would think about it this way. I mean, clearly with the way our customer rates are set demand from Microsoft, I mean essentially, I mean, given the rate charges that Microsoft would receive, they will pay their fair share of whatever additional capacity and energy is needed. So it wouldn\u2019t be a crowd out type of a type of a factor at all, in my opinion. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then just on the equity common scale, I just want to get a little bit of a better sense on timing and the trigger. Is it like, would it be Microsoft related spending? Because I have to imagine if the facilities at whatever 2025, 2026 facility the generation needs to be before that \u2013 transmission and distribution needs would be before that. So what\u2019s the trigger for incremental equity? Is it Microsoft or is there other things we should be thinking about? Gale Klappa : I think it\u2019s both. I mean, certainly if we need to add significant capacity to support Microsoft\u2019s operation here, but there are other things going on. The other economic developments that have occurred, for example, I mean we talk a lot about Haribo, but they are now up and running and they\u2019ve told us they will produce 132 million pounds of gummy bears in the next 12 month period. So there\u2019s a good bit of economic activity going on. So if you think about transmission, and we\u2019re going to start to see in the next five-year plan the impact of tranche one from the MISO planning process, so I think we\u2019re going to see an uptick in transmission investments. I think we\u2019re going to see clearly some additional capacity need. We need to continue to harden our distribution networks. There are a lot of moving pieces and all of them moving in a direction of a stronger capital budget. And as Scott and I have talked about stronger for longer in terms of our continuing growth projections. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. I guess, we\u2019ll wait for \u2013 it should be an interesting update. And for the record, Gale, I did not crash any Porsches. Thanks guys. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll, Shar. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Gale Klappa : Hi, Durgesh. How you doing? Durgesh Chopra : Hey good afternoon, Gale. I\u2019m doing just fine, thanks for asking. Just \u2013 Xia, sorry if I missed it, but what drove the $0.08 variance versus guidance? Like what were the kind of the tailwinds you had, which then drove the beat versus your guidance in the quarter? Gale Klappa : Xia told me it was superior management, but she probably has a more granular answer. Xia Liu : It was \u2013 it\u2019s a little better fuel and quite a bit better O&M. And weather was actually slightly negative compared to normal, but it\u2019s better fuel, better O&M and a couple of other items. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So I guess in terms of the guidance for back half of the year, I\u2019m just thinking about like how are you positioned versus your guidance there. I mean, is better O&M versus your plan, correct? Xia Liu : Yes. We see quite a bit of O&M tailwind coming in, in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019ll expect to see O&M to be much better than Q4 last year. We expect fuel to be better and additional PTCs and other items, but quite a bit of O&M and fuel tailwind in the fourth quarter. Gale Klappa : And Durgesh, just to add on to what Xia is saying, if you recall, there were a number of very significant items in Q4 last year that will not repeat in Q4 this year. So there\u2019s a very major difference as we compare the comps for Q4 of 2022 and what we expect to happen in Q4 of this year. Xia Liu : And remember, we guided 2% to 3% higher on day-to-day O&M this year compared to last year. So you see some quarter-to-quarter variances, but for the year we still expect that to be 2% to 3% higher than last year. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks for all that additional color. Maybe just \u2013 Xia, just \u2013 I know we recently talked about transferability and the implications to FFO and there was a lot of discussion amongst your peers on how that needs to be \u2013 how that should be treated. Maybe just any additional color or thoughts there or progress you\u2019re making with other stakeholders on how are you going to treat the transferability as cash flow? Gale Klappa : We\u2019ll ask Xia to give you the detail on this, but I would say one very important point to kind of kick off the answer is that our entire industry is really aligned around what we believe is the proper treatment of these ongoing transfers that will happen across the industry, the ongoing sale of production tax credits. And that alignment across the industry has really resulted in I think, Xia, a very thorough and very solid white paper. Xia Liu : Yes. We \u2013 I developed a very comprehensive white paper. Really outlined the views from FASB from the big four accounting firms, from the \u2013 over, like Gale said, the industry. So they shared the white paper with the rating agencies and all that is to say, I think everybody is aligned in terms of we plan to follow GAAP and the transferability will go through income tax provision on income statement, therefore, would be picked up as FFO. So we are looking forward to continuing to work with the rating agencies on this issue. I will say, though, is we would not issue equity just to address that transferability item. So that's something we'll continue to work with rating agencies. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thanks. So it sounds like discussion is underway there. I appreciate that color as well. Thank you, guys. Gale Klappa : Take care, Durgesh. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Good afternoon, Gale, Xia and Scott, No dogs, no Porsches, but plenty of gummy bears here. Just maybe two housekeeping items I had on the PDF Page 12 of your release. Just curious if you could give us some more color. The decline in large commercial industrial sales, and maybe I have the wrong view, I typically view them as maybe like weather agnostic, but yet they've come in 3%. Just thoughts on that? Gale Klappa : Yes. A couple of thoughts, and we'll ask Xia to give you some chapter and verse on some specifics. But two things that as we've looked at the data, and again, we have a very granular breakdown of the major industrial sectors that we serve. So let me first say, most people, just as you mentioned, Anthony, look at large commercial and industrial as fairly weather insensitive. Fairly, as you said, fairly weather agnostic. I will say, though, and you've heard me say this a gazillion times, the weather normalization is more \u2013 it's more precise and accurate. And as we look at kind of backdrop of the economy in Wisconsin, as we look at the jobs that have been added and as we kind of look at the industrial sectors, I would describe the industrial economy in Wisconsin for the first half of 2023 is really fairly flat. There were a couple of major customers who had outages, planned outages, et cetera, that affected the numbers. But the 3% seems, on a weather-normal basis, seems a little draconian to me. I think Scott and I and Xia have already worked through this, and we kind of look at it as kind of first half flat. But having said that, the most recent data is pretty encouraging. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes. Just to put it in perspective, in Q1, we saw a minus 3.9% quarter-over-quarter. Q2, that number became better to minus 3.1%, like you pointed out, Anthony. I think if you look at Q2 by month, June was fairly close to the forecast. If you look at the last four weeks compared to the last 13 weeks or even the prior four weeks, we're seeing lots of green. Actually, everything was picking up. So we are very cautiously optimistic that the large C&I will come back in the second half of the year, so nothing to worry too much about. And I would just say that on residential, it's pretty flat year-over-year, and \u2013 but it's fairly better than prior to COVID and that's the sticky point on the residential usage. Small C&I, actually year-to-date, is on par with last year. So those are higher margin segments. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly, you've been very clear on what would cause you to issue more equity. Xia, you had said it's not so much to \u2013 if it was to \u2013 I don't want to say, put the words in your mouth, but like the credit agency, it's more for growth. Is it fair to say that if you got to the point where there was more growth that had to be financed that you would finance that \u2013 a cap structure that's probably equal to what you have at the regulated utilities? Or is there an opportunity that you would look to over-equitize, I guess the term some are using, if you had the additional to get some growth going on? Xia Liu : I think the first and foremost is we're still developing the capital plan. So the numbers are \u2013 we're still developing it. But like Gale said in his prepared remarks, if growth, capital growth is significantly higher, we wouldn't mind turning on the employee benefit plans, the dribble plans and rely on maybe ATM, but we don't see any block sales at this point, number one. Number two, we are very confident in our long-term EPS growth forecast. We don't expect any equity sales to dilute the long-term EPS growth. And I'll also say that we're very mindful about the rating agencies and we want to work with them, but the equity would be to support growth. Gale Klappa : And a very good description that Xia just made. I will say, she also mentioned and I would just reiterate, for the one item on FFO to debt that might affect our rating at one particular agency, we wouldn't issue equity simply to chase that particular item. Xia Liu : That's the transferability. That's transferability. Yes. Anthony Crowdell : Great, thanks for the clarity. And again, congrats on a great quarter. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Good to see you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll, Michael. How you doing? Michael Sullivan : Hey, Gale. I\u2019m doing great. Thanks. Wanted to just circle back to the Microsoft, and just what you're seeing in terms of long-term sales growth potential there? And then maybe if you could just compare and contrast what this looks like relative to \u2013 there was a lot of excitement around the Foxconn build out a couple of years ago. I know different companies, different situations. But just in terms of how you think about that from a planning standpoint, with another big name company coming to your service territory? Gale Klappa : Yes. Great question, Michael. Let me just phrase it this way. I think we will certainly know by the fall and certainly in time for our new five-year capital plan, what the next \u2013 what the time period between now and say, 2030 will look like in terms of Microsoft's capacity and energy needs. I mean they are \u2013 I mentioned in my prepared remarks, they are full speed ahead. I mean they purchased the 315 acres in a very short period of time in that technology park, earthwork has already begun, they are still refining their plans. But everything we're hearing from Microsoft would indicate that they're planning a very major investment here, and they need to do it in a relatively short time frame. So there's really no question in our minds about how strong the intention and how strong the momentum is from the Microsoft development. As it relates to Foxconn, well, back in 2017, they announced a long-term, very, very significant plan. They were talking about 10,000 jobs over 10 to 12 years or 10 to 13 years. They were talking about $10 billion of investment. At this stage of the game, Foxconn, which is working in Area 1 of that park, Foxconn has invested over $1 billion and has over 1,000 employees. So while they have been slower to ramp up and their business plan has changed almost completely from the original thinking, they are still growing in that area. But Microsoft, I think they're really not talking at the moment about a long-term 10 to 15 year plan like Foxconn was. They're talking about, at least at the beginning here, they've called it an initial investment that they really want to get moving on, and that would affect our next five-year capital plan. Does that respond to your question, Michael? Michael Sullivan : Yes. Super helpful. And just as a follow-on, I think someone asked earlier or there's been a couple of questions around new capacity needs and new generation that you might have to build. And given the quick turnaround time, is further delaying any currently planned retirements contemplated at all if things were looking kind of tight from a time frame perspective? Gale Klappa : Well, that's a great question, and we're looking at all of that. I'll let Scott give you his view on that. Scott Lauber : So we're going \u2013 it's a great question. We're going through the planning process right now. We're evaluating what our capacity needs are. And you know MISO has changed is capacity needs over the seasonal approach too, which will also affect our capital plans as we look at it this fall. So right now, nothing to announce. We're just going through the analysis. Gale Klappa : Scott has made a really good point that we shouldn't gloss over though, and that is as MISO has looked at its responsibility to ensure reliability, they really are changing their capacity rules that all of us need to abide by. And it will have a \u2013 we believe it will have a particular effect on our winter capacity reserves. That's all being factored into our new five-year capital plan. Michael Sullivan : Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Gale Klappa : Take care, Michael. Operator : With that, I will turn the call back over to Gale Klappa for any closing remarks. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for being with us. If you have any additional questions, feel free to call Beth Straka.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Third Quarter 2023 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : From America's Heartland, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2023 earnings of $1 a share. We delivered another solid quarter of growth, and we remain on track for a strong 2023. Our focus on executing the fundamentals of our business is creating real value for our customers and our stockholders. Today, we're also reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. The range is $4.56 to $4 -- I'm sorry -- $4.58 to $4.62 a share with an expectation of completing the year in the upper half of the range. As always, this assumes normal weather through the final quarter of 2023. Switching gears now, our big news for the day is the rollout of our ESG progress plan for the period 2024 through 2028. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $23.4 billion with an ongoing focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $3.3 billion above our previous five-year plan, that's more than a 16% increase. Several factors of driving the investment outlined in our updated ESG progress plan. The first of these factors is the economic growth we're seeing in the Milwaukee region, particularly in what we call the I-94 corridor in the southeastern part of the state between Milwaukee and the Illinois state line, from data centers to pharmaceuticals to micro inverters for solar panels from even more gummy bears to massive new distribution and fulfillment centers. And this growth is also spanning new commercial and residential development in the region. In our new five-year plan, we expect our asset base to grow at an average rate of 8.1% a year. And as we fund this growth with an appropriate financing package, we project our earnings per share will continue to rise at a compound annual rate of 6.5% to 7% a year. As we've been discussing with you, our plan will include growth equity in the form of programmatic equity, including our dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans, and at the market plans. There is no need for block equity in the five-year plan, and we'll start in 2024 by issuing a $100 million to $200 million of new equity. Xia will provide you with more details on the financing plan in just a few minutes. I'd also like to point out a few other quick highlights for you. Over the next five years, we'll continue to make great progress in transforming our power generation fleet and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In the plan, for example, we're making a significant commitment to new solar, wind and battery storage, as well as modern efficient natural gas generation and LNG storage. In addition, we'll be adapting to the new seasonal capacity rules being put in place by MISO, Midcontinent Independent System Operator. American Transmission Company will be adding needed transmission capability and to help assure energy security for our customers will continue to harden our distribution networks. On the environmental front, our plan still calls for reducing CO2 emissions from our power generation fleet by 80% by the end of 2030. And I'm pleased to report that assuming timely regulatory approvals, we now project a complete exit from call three years earlier by the end of 2032. So the future is bright, the investment opportunity is long, strong, and highly executable. And Scott will provide you with some specifics in just a few minutes. And now a brief look at the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.1%, continuing a long running trend below the national average. And as we look inside the numbers, we see an encouraging upward trend in Wisconsin's labor force participation of this year. As I mentioned, growing companies are investing and expanding in our region. Microsoft is now moving dirt and moving full speed ahead to develop its new data center complex in that I-94 corridor, we mentioned south of Milwaukee. And Haribo officially opened the doors of its new confectionary plant in July. Fast forward to today, and Haribo is already planning to double the size of its production capability, adding more capacity for gummy bears, new technology and additional employees. And so -- also south of Milwaukee, Uline plans to open a 1 million square foot facility this year. Uline, in case you're not familiar with the name, is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials for businesses throughout North America and even more expansion is planned by Uline for 2025. These developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our five-year plan. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our capital projects, our regulatory calendar, and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some of the specifics on our capital plan. As Gale noted, we have identified $3.3 billion of additional investments compared to our last five-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes. Between 2024 and 2028, we plan to increase our investment in renewables by $1.4 billion. With that, we expect to invest in 3,800 megawatts of new renewable capacity. In the plan is a billion dollar increase in transmission investment. This is our share of the ATC plan. Renewable projects and regional growth are among the driving factors. To support reliable service for our customers, we expect to spend an additional $1.3 billion on natural gas generation over the five-year plan. This includes both combustion turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines, or RICE units. We also have planned to invest in additional $800 million in liquified natural gas capacity, which will be used for electric generation and for our natural gas operations on the coldest days of the year. With these important investments for our utilities, we have reduced our planned investment in our Energy Infrastructure segment. We'll be happy to share more details with you at the upcoming EEI conference. Now, moving on to the regulatory front. As you recall, we expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission before the end of the year on our limited reopener filings. We also have an update on our rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Recently, the administrative law judge on the case issued a proposed order largely consistent with staff's recommendation. The order recommends a 9.83% return on equity at both utilities, and we expect a final decision by the end of November. And moving to the other states. I'm pleased to report that both the Minnesota and Michigan Commissions have recently approved settlements on our rate reviews. Meanwhile, we're making progress on a number of regulated capital projects. As you recall, we closed on our first option at the West Riverside Energy Center earlier this year, adding a 100 megawatts of efficient combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. Since our last call, we filed our request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to invest $100 million to add this capacity in 2024. Elsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris and Darien solar battery parks. You may recall we had solar panels waiting on final release from a bonded warehouse in Chicago. I'm happy to report that those panels are being cleared. The first 100 megawatts have been released and the trucks are rolling to our Badger Hollow II site. We expect all of our panels to be released and in our possession by the end of this year. We are on track for Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year, with the Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work is underway on the Darien facility, which is planned to go into service by the end of 2024. We'll keep you updated on any future developments. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott. Thanks very much. And now just a quick reminder about our dividend. Our dividend growth continues to stand in the top decile of our industry. In fact, we were recently named one of the 10 best dividend stocks in America by Morningstar. As usual, I expect our Board will assess our dividend plans for next year and our regularly scheduled meeting in December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're positioned well within that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more information on our third quarter financials and a good bit of detail on our upcoming five-year financing plan. Xia, all yours. Xia Liu : Thanks Gale. Our 2023 third quarter earnings of a $1 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on page 15. I will walkthrough the significant drivers. Our earnings from utility operations were $0.18 above the third quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated one penny negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances were more than offset in the quarter. Rate base growth contributed $0.13 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota energy resources. Additionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.13 and lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.02 improvement. Before I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were down eight tenths of a percent quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage was up 1.3% and is ahead of our forecast through the first nine months of the year. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up four tenths of a percent and are tracking our forecast for the year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings decreased $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Recall that last year we recorded a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment decreased one penny in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. This was mostly driven by lower wind production, partially offset by tax credits on projects that we placed into service. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segments decreased $0.08 largely due to higher interest expense. As Gale noted, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. This includes October weather and assumed normal weather for the remainder of the year. Now turning to our financing plan. Gale and Scott have already discussed the new five-year capital plan. I'll provide details related to our anticipated financing activity to support the plan. You can find this information on page 22 of the earnings package. As you can see on the chart, over the next five years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 65% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 7% from issuance of common equity. As Gale mentioned earlier, we expect to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans and at the market programs to tap into the equity market. Our common equity issuance is projected to be in a range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024 and $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion over the next five-year plan. Recall, our equity ratios in our utilities are thicker, particularly at Wisconsin Electric. Supporting these thicker equity layers results in approximately $400 million of common equity raise. The remaining equity raise represents approximately 50% of incremental capital spend. As you know, our equity issuances post 2024 will be tied to our capital plan rateably at approximately $450 million a year. This financing plan not only supports our long-term earnings growth rate, but also helps maintain our targeted credit metrics. In addition, I'll quickly address our upcoming holding company refinancing needs. Over the next three years, we have total maturities of about $2.8 billion. The $600 million that matures in 2024 carries a very low coupon. However, the remaining $2.2 billion scheduled to mature in 2026 has a weighted average coupon of just under 5%, which represents lower refinancing risk. In closing, as shown on the last page of the earnings package, through our capital allocations, we expect the percent of assets invested in our regulated electric businesses to grow faster. At the same time, the percent of assets in gas distribution and in contracted renewables is expected to decline. We are very excited about the investment opportunities ahead of us. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : All right. Xia, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and the company continues to perform at a very high level. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Now, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Rock and roll, Shar. How are you? Shar Pourreza : Mr. Klappa, how you doing? Gale Klappa : Doing great. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. So, Gale, obviously, in Xia's prepared remarks, she hit on why the equity guide was obviously somewhat large and what would be dictated by the growth CapEx increase. It's obviously, because of the higher equity layers. I guess, how should we think about this in terms of the balance sheet capacity it gives you? How is the conversations with the current rating agency? And related, are you done now through the trajectory or could incremental CapEx lend to more equity? I mean, you do tend to raise CapEx every year in the Microsoft opportunities still out there. Thanks. Gale Klappa : Yeah. Yeah, great question, Shar. Well, first of all, kind of let me back up and reiterate a couple of things that Xia mentioned. I think you can look at, and Xia touched on this, about $400 million of the equity raise. At least in my mind, I look at that as kind of a one-time catch up because over the last rate case outcomes, we've received thicker equity layers virtually in every situation. So about $400 million of that really just goes to support, really strong credit metrics at all of our utilities. So I would look at that particular $400 million chunk that Xia referred to, Shar, as kind of a one-time catch up. And then to answer your question about further capital. And yes, the Microsoft plan is still being developed. We'll know a lot more in the next few months beyond what we've put in this plan related to Microsoft as they continue to refine their plan for the large complex that they're going to develop here in southeastern Wisconsin. But I think the way to look at it is that incremental capital beyond what's in the plan, probably equities about 50% of that incremental capital. Xia, any other thoughts? Xia Liu : No, you addressed it. Gale Klappa : Okay. Shar, does that respond to your question? Shar Pourreza : Fantastic. And then just the $3.3 billion, any sense on the profile of that CapEx, or is that like an EEI update? Gale Klappa : Yeah. Let's walk through all of that in detail at EEI for you. We'll have a very specific breakdown for you EEI. But I think clearly there's going to be some additional capital. I mean, we mentioned generation and LNG as kind of large contributors to the capital plan. So I think the outer years or the later years in the five-year plan will be larger than the first couple of years. I think the first, the first couple of years probably the increase will be more dominated by transmission in the first couple of years. And then as we build generation and as we build the LNG facilities, you'll see kind of a rise in that five-year capital plan. I will say this, there is no white space in that five-year capital plan. I mean, we have just tremendous opportunity in front of us. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And that's how we should think about the profile of the equity, right? It matches with the CapEx. Gale Klappa : Absolutely. Yeah. We will match the equity issuance with the capital investment each year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then lastly, just moving to the Infrastructure segment, it's a pretty big reduction, Gale, in spending there. Is that a function of a lack of opportunities despite our IRA or is it more about making sure you kind of stay within that business risk profile and credit metrics to somewhat appease the agencies? I guess, how should we think about that segment on a go forward basis? Thanks. Gale Klappa : Yeah. Shar, great question. Let me just first say, there's no lack of opportunity as we see it in the Infrastructure segment. But what we're doing here is simply reallocating capital and resources to the tremendous growth opportunity that's evolving here in our regulated business driven by Microsoft, driven by the other economic growth that we've described to you. So this is not really any comment at all in terms of the potential, the returns or the opportunity in the Infrastructure segment. It's just -- we have a tremendous opportunity here now to reallocate capital to our regulated enterprise. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. All right. I'll pass it to someone else. We'll see you in about a week. Thanks guys. Gale Klappa : All right. Take care, Shar. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Hey, Ross. How are you? Ross Fowler : Good afternoon. So Gale, just before we get into it, I've got November 22nd already circled on my calendar for Buck Celtics [ph], so we'll get there quick, quicker than you think. Gale Klappa : It really will. It'll be fascinating. Ross Fowler : Yeah. So just a couple from me. I mean, I know, Gale, as you talked about sort of the DRIP in the past, you never really turned it off to my understanding. You've just been sort of buying back those shares. What's kind of been the traditional uptake of that DRIP program as I try to scale that equity in the plan to sort of what is DRIP internal and what might be ATM? Gale Klappa : Well, it's a good question and I will look to Xia to make sure my numbers are right, but it's varied over the years, the DRIP program, but generally it's about $100 million to $150 million. Xia Liu : $100 million to $200 million over the -- on average over the past four years is not just DRIP, it's DRIP and the employee benefit plans and so what we call the programmatic plans. So on average it's $100 million to $200 million a year. Gale Klappa : And Ross, you're right, we have been buying shares off the market to satisfy both the DRIP plan and the employee benefit plan. So this simply kind of puts us back in a position where I think everybody else in the industry already is. Ross Fowler : Right. Got gotcha, Gale. And then just there's been some confusion around in the market. Maybe as you change sort of your coretirement deadlines here in this plan and push those into the end of -- bring those forward actually I should say to the end of 32. Just remind me how the power of the future works and then confirm for me that I'm right in thinking that if you do natural gas conversion at those units, that that fits into that mechanism as well. Gale Klappa : Ross, you're absolutely right. It does fit into the mechanism. One way to look at it is all of the arrangements and all of the legal situations related to power of the future and all the regulatory situation related to power of the future is fuel agnostic. So there's really no regulatory approval required for us to do the major activity that we're already underway with, which is beginning a transition of the new coal-fired units at our Oak Creek site from coal and natural gas. And again, we're already making modifications at the plant itself. We're already testing burn of natural gas, up to certain levels. We're planning to bring in larger meter sets, et cetera. So the work is underway to continue the transition of coal and natural gas at our new Oak Creek units. The other power of the future units are already natural gas fired. So -- but there is no -- there really is no legal or regulatory requirement related to the concept of transitioning from coal to natural gas. Ross Fowler : And so that investment would earn that higher ROE and then go through that same sort of mortgage amortization process, if I'm thinking about that right? Gale Klappa : That is exactly correct, Ross. Yes. Ross Fowler : Okay. All right. I'll leave it there and pass it on to the next. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Thank you, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Afternoon, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey, Gale. How are you? Gale Klappa : We're good. We're good. By the way, Michael, there's no truth to the rumor that you're dressing up as Taylor Swift tonight for Halloween, is there? Michael Sullivan : No, no. I've had enough with these at this point. Gale Klappa : Or maybe you're dressing up as Travis Kelsey. I'm not sure. Michael Sullivan : Yeah. Anyways. At this point where we're at on the Illinois case, is it fair to say we're going to a final order in those cases, or is there still a chance something could be worked out here? Gale Klappa : Time will tell. Obviously, my sense is we will probably end up with a final review and a final decision by the Illinois Commission. Scott, your view. Scott Lauber : Yeah. I expect -- I think there's some moral arguments going on in the next couple weeks, and I expect something by the end of November here. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask, in terms of timing. I know a lot of people have been asking on this, Gale, just your kind of timeline for being in the current role that you're in. I think the last update there was through May of 2024. Just any sense of when you'll update us on that front. Are you tying yourself to [indiscernible] with his extension or? Gale Klappa : Well, the problem is I asked our Board for an extension at [indiscernible] level, and I'm not sure they're going to buy that -- and I appreciate the question. You're correct. My current agreement goes to May of 2024, and we're having some really good discussions with the Board and with Scott. And we'll have an announcement here in the next very short period of time. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Michael. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, how are you doing? Gale Klappa : I'm good. I got -- I now have a name for your new dog. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Go for it. I'm all yours. Gale Klappa : Equity. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Fair enough. True story. Love it. Darius's got his second, and I'm still here without it yet, so I got to catch up. That's all I got to say. Gale Klappa : There you go. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Don't worry. He's dressing his dog up for Halloween and I still -- whatever. It's all good. Look, you always have fun. I always got to say, I mean, you're still having fun though in the role though, right? As a follow up to the last question in brief. Gale Klappa : Still having fun. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. Well, that's good to hear. Look more seriously though. I -- maybe just to follow up on this, on the Microsoft response and just like what's embedded in the outlook versus what's incremental. I get that there's no white space. I mean, really the question is how soon and how much further can you go to the extent to which that they give clarity on their plans. Obviously things are actively rolling on their front. In addition to some of these other announcements that you articulated, I just wanted to understand, how fully baked or how much -- well, obviously it's fully baked, how much further you could go and how soon that could be, just given how meaningful the plan sizes are that are contemplated. Gale Klappa : Yeah. Great question, Julien. So let's put a couple of numbers around it. In this five-year plan, in this new five-year plan, we've included about 1400 megawatts of additional capacity to support the Microsoft data center development and some of the broad based economic growth that we've described to you. And that new capacity is really going to be needed for energy security, and for us to continue to decarbonize. But in the current plan to support the Microsoft development and some of the other that I-94 corridor development that we've talked with you about, we're seeing the need for roughly 1400 megawatts of additional capacity that's embedded in that $3.3 billion increase in our capital plan. And we'll see where it goes. Obviously, we are beginning the process of looking at ordering equipment and starting work on identifying sites, et cetera, et cetera. So much of that capital for the capacity, the generating capacity will be in years three, four, and five. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And just on the other side of the CapEx update, if I can. First off, LNG versus more gas storage, obviously you guys have done a number of those announcements over the years. Thoughts about further acquisitions on that front, or just how you think about the fungibility one between LNG and the other? And then related here, also big update on the ATC front. Is that just all MISO Trans 1? Does that have white space in it? I mean, just a big step forward on that front too. It's overshadowed here by the generation, but I just want to come and address that too. Gale Klappa : No. There -- again, no white space at all. Scott's on the ATC board. We'll let -- ask Scott to respond to your question on the transmission. Scott Lauber : Yeah. When you look at the transmission, and it's up significantly as you noted, it is a combination of the economic development that Gale talked about, getting transmission to the region. Also the renewables we're putting on the system and other utilities in the state of putting on the system. And then just regular system renewal in ATC's footprint. So you've put it all together and it's about a $1 billion more. And I think you maybe saw their 10-year capital plan just came out and it was also a significant increase from the prior one. So good growth, just good executable capital also at American Transmission Company and we're 60% of that. Gale Klappa : And Scott, from your -- here in my discussions, some of that capital is really upgrading aging transmission facility. Scott Lauber : Exactly. It's renewing some of those older facilities that are put in years ago. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Gale Klappa : Does that answer your question? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Thank you. Scott Lauber : Yeah. The gas storage. Yeah. The LNG and gas storage, the LNG is really making sure we have the capacity and putting those units in the state of Wisconsin, just like over Christmas day weekend there was gas supply challenges. Having the LNG tank that we had at our South Oak Creek plant actually really helped the system that particular day. So having that in the state of Wisconsin is going to be very helpful on those very cold days when we need that capacity. Gale Klappa : Yeah. Scott's exactly right. And just to add onto that. We don't ever want to go through another Christmas Eve like we went through last Christmas Eve. I mean, as you know, there was a very significant cold snap. And many parts of the country had rolling blackouts. We did not, but a major transmission gas pipeline into Wisconsin lost about 40% of its capacity to bring gas in. If we hadn't had LNG storage right here that we could direct eject into our gas distribution networks, we would've had some real issues. So there's no doubt in our mind that for energy security, particularly at times when it gets to 20 and 30 degrees below zero, we need to have that capacity to keep gas flowing, to keep the heat on, and to keep the lights on in Wisconsin. So that's a big rationale, a big part of what we're accomplishing with this investment that we've outlined. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you again. Good luck guys. See you soon. Gale Klappa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Neil Kalton : Hi, guys. Gale Klappa : Hey, Neil. We're good. How's it going, Neil? Neil Kalton : It is going well. It's Halloween, fun day. So all is well down here. Just one quick question for you. So in the EPS CAGR, I think you affirmed the 6.5% to 7%. And just curious, are you assuming any changes to the allowed earned ROEs in that forecast over five years? Gale Klappa : No, we're basically assuming status quo. Neil Kalton : Okay. That was my question. That is all. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Thanks Neil. Hang in there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Afternoon, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good afternoon. Happy Halloween there. Gale Klappa : Happy Halloween to you. Jeremy Tonet : Thanks. I was just looking maybe to quantify transferability a little bit more. And if you could walk us through the role of IRA track -- tax credit transferability in your financing plans, specifically, kind of with the $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion in cash from operations, how much is tax credit there? And any sense as to how much incremental debt this allows you to take on? Gale Klappa : Sure. We will ask Xia to give you the details. I will say that there's a significant amount of cash coming in from transferability of the tax credits. And it's a very positive thing overall for our cash sources. Xia? Xia Liu : Yeah. So in the five-year plan, we expect between $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion tax credits either we will use for our own tax appetite or sell to a third -- to some third-party. And that's part of the -- to your point, that's part of the FFO. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. Thank you for that. And then just kind of continuing on, I guess with equity funding in general, thank you for all the color that you provided here earlier. But just wondering, as you look forward through the plan, are your balance sheet metrics getting stronger or the metrics the same? Is this -- kind of looking to offset higher rates? Just wondering how this all comes together. Gale Klappa : Getting stronger by the day. Xia Liu : Yeah. We feel good about the -- hitting the target credit metrics. We're looking forward to sitting down. Scott and I are visiting the rating agencies next week. We look forward to the conversation with them. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe just a real quick last one and kind of better than expected results, as we look forward into to 4Q here, how we think about, I guess, O&M? Should we expect you to realize the full $40 million in nonrecurring O&M expenses from 4Q 2022 as we lap that, I guess that positive variance there, and how does this impact your O&M outlook into 2024? Gale Klappa : Well, Jeremy -- and we'll let Scott and Xia give you their view. Q4 last year had a lot of moving pieces that won't be repeated in Q4 this year. So I think you've got to look at it as a whole. There were close to $70 million of one time or different initiatives or different levers that came to pass in Q4 of 2022, that were already in 2023 here, folks. So again, I would look at -- I mean, I think the O&M numbers were a bit distorted because of things that happened that deliberately, the actions that we took in the fourth quarter last year. So again, I would look at it a little bit more holistically. We've been projecting all year a very strong fourth quarter, and in our minds, that's still very much intact. Xia? Xia Liu : Yeah. Not much to add. I think we have a little bit of -- last fourth quarter, a little bit unfavorable weather, so hopefully that's a tailwind. We have rate base increase. We have fuel upside. We have a very large O&M upside in the fourth quarter, so we feel very good about the fourth quarter projections. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Gale Klappa : Terrific. Take care, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Anthony, rock and roll. Anthony Crowdell : Good afternoon. Rock and roll. Happy Halloween. Gale Klappa : Happy Halloween. Have you got your dog dressed up in name for the Halloween night here? Anthony Crowdell : Deferred asset. No, no, no, no, no pets. The four daughters are overwhelmingly enough. So just -- I guess maybe just some quick housekeeping. Slide 21, great detail. And just curious, the footnote excludes ATC capital, when we think of the growth going on at ATC capital to Scott's comments earlier, is that self-funded, or does that also require funding by Westcon -- by WEC? Xia Liu : It's self -- it's more than self-funded. So we excluded the cap, the $3 billion in the uses. But in the sources, we also netted out the cash they send us versus what we send down to them. The net-net is a net positive. So they're self-fund -- self-funding, but more than self-funding themselves. Gale Klappa : Yeah. We get cash distributions back from ATC. So Xia is exactly right, it's self-funding plus cash back to the owners. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And I'm sure you're not looking to front run your meeting with the rating agencies, but if I could focus on, I think S&P right now has you on negative outlook. Is your assumption that the current plan will resolve their concerns? I'm assuming so. I just wanted to double check with you there. Gale Klappa : Well, a couple things. First of all, just to clarify, the parent is on negative outlook. The utilities are stable, so I just wanted to make sure everybody remembers that. And then secondly, we think, and we'll let Xia and Scott give you their view, but we think the fact that we're going to be issuing equity to support this growth plan, will be viewed quite favorably. Again, we've not issued any new shares since 2015 when we did the acquisition of Integrys. Scott, your thoughts? Scott Lauber : You're exactly right, Gale, and we'll sit down with them next week. They haven't seen the plan yet, so we just thought it made sense when we roll out the plan and then walk them through it year by year, and until they actually see it, it's hard to judge the decision. But I think we really compliment it well with our capital growth and the credit metrics overall. Gale Klappa : Xia? Xia Liu : Nothing more to add. We appreciate the opportunity to sit down with them and talk through the details. Anthony Crowdell : Well, great. Looking forward to seeing you guys in Phoenix. Thanks for the time. Gale Klappa : All right. Thank you. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ofri Mott [ph] with Ladenburg. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greetings, Ofri. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Not to beat a dead horse, but roughly where -- with the new investment program and the additional equity, do you land in terms of FFO to debt? Are you sort of in that 14% to 15% range that you've targeted? Xia Liu : No. We -- it's part of the package I think we included. So we are targeting 15% to 16% by S&P and Moody's. Unidentified Analyst : Right. So do you fall within that range then in terms of -- with the additional equity and the additional investment? Xia Liu : Yes, absolutely. Gale Klappa : Yep. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Gale Klappa : That's the whole idea. Unidentified Analyst : Great. I just wanted to sort of confirm that. And then, in terms of the coal exit, even though, it's not sort of in your power of the future contract, it likely will have a bill impact on customers. So what sort of communication do you need to have with the existing commissioners? Gale Klappa : Well, go ahead Scott. Scott Lauber : So when we look at it, we really don't see much of a bill impact because when you look at it, we're going to get the same output from the plant. You just won't have the O&M associated with running with the coal. So the real change is going to be -- you eliminate coal, but what is the price of natural gas? If natural gas would go up to $10, that's a whole different game, but that's more of a fuel issue. And the same thing with coal. So when you look at the operations, I don't think -- there's not a lot of capital investments that we're doing to do the conversion. There's smaller capital projects to just put in new burners. In fact, we're doing some this fall and next spring we're putting in some new burners also. Gale Klappa : And just to add on to what Scott's mentioned to you, this plan to convert from coal to natural gas at our newer Oak Creek units is one that's been in the making for at least a couple of years now. So we've had extensive ongoing discussions with the commissioners. They understand what we're trying to achieve. They understand the importance of continuing to cost effectively reduce CO2 emissions. And remember, our goal, which we're on track to achieve, is an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by the end of 2030. So this is not a new concept to anyone in the state. Scott Lauber : Yeah. And when you think about the EPA rules going forward, if it was on coal, you'd have to put in carbon capture or do something with hydrogen, and carbon capture would be extremely expensive. And where do you put the carbon, what you capture? So we looked at what's efficient in the long-term. Gale Klappa : And one more fact, I think it's very important to remember how critical an asset those new Oak Creek units are on most days in the Midwest operator footprint, because of the efficiency of those units and because of their incredible connection to the transmission network, those units help keep the lights on, not only in Wisconsin, but across the Midwest. So very important asset. We're on track to do what we need to do to continue with the life of that asset for a long period of time with much lower emissions. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Gale Klappa : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Gale Klappa : Greeting, Paul. Paul Patterson : Greetings. So just back to the whole -- back to the rate question. I guess with the new outlook that you guys have regarding rate base growth, obviously interest rates, inflation, et cetera. What is your expectation in Wisconsin and Illinois in terms of what base rate changes customers might see? Has it changed or? Gale Klappa : Not really, but let's kind of take it state by state. In Illinois, what we're proposing in our current rate review is really no change in the level of investment in upgrading the pipe system, the natural gas pipe delivery system under Chicago. So we've been averaging about $280 million a year of investment in upgrading that aging corroding pipe network. We're about 35%, 36% complete with the upgrades, and we're proposing to continue at about $280 million a year. That's about the pace that we can do to get work done inside the city of Chicago. So -- and remember in our current rate review proposal in Chicago, even with the rate increase if fully approved, coupled with the decline in commodity costs of natural gas, we're expecting flat customer bills for this coming winter in Illinois. So essentially this plan really doesn't change the underlying fact pattern in Illinois. And with the load growth, the demand growth that we expect to see in Wisconsin, again, we've been saying we think inflation related rate increases in Wisconsin and -- that's, at least to me, seems to still be the case. Scott Lauber : Yeah. And we'll see as we continue to roll out the plans here and look at the timing of it. So I think it'll be inflation, approximately inflation as you go forward. Gale Klappa : Hope that responds, Paul. Paul Patterson : No, no, that -- that's helpful. Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. End of Q&A: Gale Klappa : All right. Thank you. All right, sports fans. Well, this concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for your questions. Thanks for participating. If you have any additional questions, feel free to contact Ms. Straka. She can be reached at (414) 221-4639 and we look forward to seeing you all in Phoenix in just a couple of weeks. Take care everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. Before the conference call begins, please note that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. This call also will include non-GAAP financial information. The company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the materials posted on its website for this conference call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive, Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $4.63 a share. This excludes a one-time noncash charge of $0.41 a share. You may recall that the Illinois Commerce Commission in November disallowed the construction costs for the modern service centers and facilities that we built in Illinois to improve employee safety and productivity. We firmly believe that the investments were necessary and prudent, and at the appropriate time, we will appeal the decision in court. Despite the setback in Illinois, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure, from customer satisfaction to financial performance to steady execution of our capital plan. Xia Liu will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics for 2023 in just a few moments. Turning to other regulatory matters, the Wisconsin Commission approved our limited reopener filings in December, new rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And in Illinois a limited rehearing has been scheduled for a portion of our safety modernization program. As a reminder, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered a pause in that program for at least one year. We've been systematically replacing old leaking cast iron pipes under the streets of Chicago. This long running project is approximately 38% complete today. We had plan to invest approximately $265 million in these safety upgrades during 2024. Given the Commission's order, we will not be carrying out the program as envisioned. We honestly do not believe that stopping the work is in the best interests of our Chicago customers. But we will have another opportunity to make our case in the coming months through this limited rehearing. In addition, the Illinois commission will open a new docket this month to examine the future of gas across the state of Illinois. This review is expected to take at least one year to complete. Switching gears now, let's look at the investment needs of our broader enterprise. We continue to refine our ESG progress plan our roadmap if you will for the period 2024 through 2028. As you'd expect, we're lowering our plan capital investment in Illinois. But the bigger picture is strong and growing. And today we're increasing our five-year plan by $300 million. What was a $23.4 billion plan, the largest in our company's history, is now a five-year plan totaling $23.7 billion. The increase is focused on two categories, electric distribution to support the strong economic growth we're seeing in Wisconsin and WEC Energy's projects that are in our due diligence pipeline. That's our WEC infrastructure projects. In fact, we're in the final stage now of vetting another major project for our infrastructure portfolio, a 300-megawatt solar investment for approximately $460 million. Closing and commercial operation could take place in the second quarter of this year, we'll keep you informed. Overall, the building blocks of our updated capital plan clearly support our long-term growth rate. Growth from our five-year plan on a compound average annual basis remains in the 6.5% to 7% range. As always, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2023 guidance. However, we expect earnings for 2024 to come in at or below the current consensus estimate. The reason is simple. As we redeploy capital, at least temporarily away from Illinois, the majority of the quality projects we're investing in will not be in service for the full year 2024. So for this year, for 2024, we projected earnings to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share and Xia Liu will provide you with more detail in just a moment or two. One final but important point about our capital plan. As a percentage of the total enterprise, our regulated electric business will be larger five years from now than it is today. Economic development and reliability and decarbonization are driving that growth. We plan to continue our investment in the infrastructure segment as well. But five years from now, we expect the infrastructure segment will be only 6% of our asset base. And now turning to the regional economy, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.3%. That continues a long running trend below the national average. And as we've discussed, we're seeing some really exciting developments here on the state. You've heard about Microsoft's plans in the Wisconsin Innovation Park South of Milwaukee. That investment continues to build. Microsoft has now purchased a total of 1345 acres of property, and construction is already underway on a major data center complex. Of course, Microsoft didn't alone in what we call the I-94 corridor, companies like [indiscernible] and Uline are expanding their footprints as well. For example, Uline just announced plans for a third office building in Pleasant prairie. Uline expects to complete construction by 2025, creating additional space for more than 700 workers. Uline in case you're not familiar with the name is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials to businesses throughout North America. And just last week, West Rock a fortune 200 company that produces sustainable paper and packaging materials, announced plans to build a 587,000 square foot manufacturing facility on the former site of our Pleasant Prairie power plant. These developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our five-year ESG progress plan. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan, and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some more updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The reopener filings address recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service in 2023 and also this year. These are renewable facilities, raise generation and LNG reliability investments. The return on equity and the equity layer were not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. In the coming months, we plan to file new rate reviews in Wisconsin for test years 2025 and 2026. You heard from Gale on the latest developments in Illinois. The commission has granted us a limited rehearing, focused on our request rescore $134 million of Safety Modernization Program in 2024. This mostly rates to emergency work, work that is in progress, and work driven by public entities like the City of Chicago. We expect the commission to issue an order by June 1. Now turning to our updated capital plan. We have identified $300 million of additional capital investment compared to the initial version of our five-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes, which are summarized for your reference in the slides we provided for today's call. Most notably, we have included several new investments in our energy infrastructure portfolio. We're continuing to take advantage of production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, while providing solid returns through long-term offtake agreements. We expect these projects to add approximately $800 million to our plant. And we're already on our way. Just last month, we closed on an incremental 10% ownership of the Samson solar farm now in operation in northern Texas, we now own 90% of the farm for a total investment of $280 million. And as Gale mentioned, we have another major solar project in the sights. We also plan to increase investment of Wisconsin by $300 million to better support economic development and reliability in the state. Offsetting these incremental investments, you will see a $800 million decrease in our planned spending on the Illinois gas delivery system over the five-year period. This is driven by the regulatory order we received in November. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. We continue to work toward our ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the end of 2023, we achieved a 54% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation compared to 2005. That puts us well on our way toward an 80% reduction in target by the end of 2030, as we build our portfolio of low and no carbon generation. And the progress continues, the final panels of the Badger Hollow Solar Park are now in service completing the largest solar project in Wisconsin history. As you'll recall our Wisconsin utilities on a total of 200 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. The facilities first phase went online in December 2121, and the second phase wrapped up at the end of 2023. In addition, our Bluff Creek LNG storage facility is now in service. Liquefied natural gas provides a solution to meet peak customer demand for heating, as well as gasified needed for power generation. This storage will be necessary during extreme weather events like we experienced in mid-January. I'm also pleased to announce that we have been using renewable natural gas in our distribution system. This replaces a portion of the traditional natural gas we deliver to customers, while contributing to our methane reduction goal. Our latest pilot project with EPRI and CMBlu Energy is also underway. And as you'll recall, this is testing a long duration battery made with environmentally friendly materials. We look forward to sharing the results across the industry later this year. It's a strong start to the year our capital plan is robust, and highly executable. And we continue to focus on the fundamentals of the business. With that I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Now, as you may have seen, our board at its January meeting, raised the quarterly dividend to $0.835 a share. That's an increase of $0.055 a share or 7%. This will mark the 21st consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future. One other quick note on our track record of dividend growth. We learned last week that WEC Energy is being added to S&P's high dividend Aristocrat Index. This index is made up exclusively of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Next up Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results, our financing plan, and our 2024 guidance. Xia? Xia Liu : Thanks Gale. Turning now to earnings. Excluding the $0.41 per share noncash impairment charge in Illinois, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share were $4.63. Our earnings package includes a year-over-year comparison of results on page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, weather had an estimated $0.24 negative impact year-over-year. In fact, January, February and December of 2023 are the warmest on record over the past 133 years. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.33 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances are more than offset during the year. Rate base growth contributed $0.75 of positive variance year-over-year. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin and Minnesota utilities, as well as the rate increase for Peoples Gas that was effective December 1, 2023. Additionally, fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.14. Lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.10 improvement, and taxes and other items benefited earnings by $0.04. Remember, we originally guided our 2023 total company day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than 2022. Throughout the year, we were able to manage to a much tighter range. Our actual 2023 total company day-to-day O&M was only six-tenths of 1% higher than 2022. Turning now to sales, you'll see the details on Page 12 of the earnings package. On a weather normal basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin excluding the iron ore mine were down 1% in 2023. The decrease was driven by our large commercial and industrial sales, which were down 3.3%. Meanwhile, residential and small commercial and industrial sales increased two-tenths of 1%, which were ahead of our forecasts. Our sales projections for 2024 can be found on pages 12 and 13 of the earnings package. Overall, we're projecting relatively flat electric sales year-over-year, and eight-tenths of 1% growth in gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American transmission company, earnings decreased $0.03 compared to 2022. Recall that last year, we recorded a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. This was partially offset by a $0.02 improvement in earnings related to additional capital investment. Earnings at our energy infrastructure segments improved $0.04 in '23 compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production tax credits. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segments decreased $0.29, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.18 per share on an adjusted basis in 2023. Now, Gale and Scott have laid out our refreshed five-year capital plan. In light of the $300 million increase to our capital plan, we have revised our funding plan accordingly. Consistent with our previous message, we're funding this increase with an even split between debt and equity. As you can see on page 21 of the earnings package, we now expect to issue between 1.95 billion and 2.3 5 billion of common equity over the next five years. As you can see on the chart over the next five years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 64% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 8% from issuance of common equity. We have turned on new equity to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. And we also expect to use aftermarket programs. Our common equity issuance is still projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024. Post 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital plan ratably at approximately $500 million a year. Finally, let's look at our earnings guidance. As Gale stated for the full year 2024, we're providing guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. In developing this guidance range, we took into consideration the expected loss of earnings from lower rebates in Illinois, and timing of several projects under development. Now let me briefly discuss our day-to-day nonfuel O&M expectations. We expect our 2024 O&M to be 6% to 7% higher. Approximately 5% of the increase is driven by assets that were included in recent rate cases, projects in the infrastructure segment and extraordinary storms costs in January. The remaining O&M increase of 1% to 2% is largely driven by inflation offset by operating efficiencies. Looking at the bigger picture, our O&M projection for 2024 is well below our actual O&M expenditures eight years ago in 2016. In terms of first quarter 2024 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.96 per share to $2 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Recall that we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter last year. There are a couple of main drivers for the quarter. One, weather was unfavorable by $0.10 in Q1 last year. Of course, we're assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter this year. Two, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas under the latest commission order. We now expect base revenues will be concentrated in the first and fourth quarter heating months when natural gas usage is the highest. Correspondingly, we expect lower contributions from Peoples Gas in Q2 and Q3. We'll provide you with more details as the year progresses. As a reminder, however, in Illinois, we have a decoupling mechanism in place that mitigates that weather impact. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Xia, thank you very much. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thanks, Gale. And now we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. And it looks like your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar, please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Gale, just a quick one on, so the 4.80 to 4.90 guidance for '24, I mean that obviously about 5.4% growth year-over-year. And you obviously have a very tight EPS growth range and the debit this year is clearly from the CapEx timing. As we kind of bridge into '25, let's just say can you kind of grow at that top end or above the EPS growth range to keep you within the 6.5% to 7% target? Or should we assume kind of bottom end in the near term and step up at the back half given the pace at which you may not be able to deploy capital? Gale Klappa : Well, great question, Shar. Let me say this, we have a lot of levers and a lot of great opportunities. And so it's probably too early to say exactly where in the 2025 range we might land. But we're pretty optimistic about the levers and the opportunities that we have. In 2024, of course, as we redeploy, as I mentioned in the script, as we redeploy in a way from Illinois and into quality projects, timing is really the driver here. But let me just say this, if we were able to make the top end of our 2024 guidance 4.90, we would have recovered virtually the entire hit from the Illinois rate order. So that might help put things in perspective for 2024. And then we will work on '25 and beyond. But again, we mean, just with what we're seeing here on the ground, we have tremendous opportunity for appropriate investments that will drive growth. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then, just Gale on the $800 million reduction in Illinois. Was that all related to S&P or what was the amount that was above that? And then just that concurrent shift into sort of the infrastructure segment, I guess, can you just talk about the profile of that spend and whether sort of there's any earnings accretive opportunities from this shuffle, especially since you do target returns on an adjusted basis anyway, for the infrastructure segment that is higher than the regulated side? Gale Klappa : Yes. We do. We target returns on the infrastructure segments slightly higher than the regulated piece of the business. But to answer your first question, virtually all of the $800 million reduction that you're seeing as we allocate capital on our various business segments. Virtually all of that $800 million reduction in Illinois is an assumption. Because we just don't know what S&P spending is going to look like, going forward. So that's virtually all related to the cessation of work. Shar Pourreza : Okay, got it. Okay, perfect. And then just lastly, for me, it's just an obviously the S&P program. Obviously, there's a new docket out there and there's an investigation, but there was sort of this independent engineering study that was recently conducted by the Commission that already sort of proved out that the S&P needed to be carried out. How does that kind of play into this new docket? Thanks, guys. Gale Klappa : Yes. Shar, great memory. Shar is exactly correct. A number of years ago, 2017, 2018 timeframe, the Illinois Commission ordered us to bring in a highly recognized outside engineering firm, an independent engineering firm, to assess the condition of particularly the cast iron and ductile iron pipes under Chicago. Remember, we started out on this program, there were 2000 miles of iron pipes that we believe needed to be replaced. It's called the Kiefner study, K-I-E-F-N-E-R, it's on file with the commission itself, if anyone wants to take a look at it. But long story short, that Kiefner study, which was delivered to the Commission in January of 2020, concluded something pretty stark. The conclusion was that more than 80% of the remaining iron pipes under Chicago have a remaining useful life of less than 15 years. That material was reintroduced in our rate case of this past fall, it was dismissed by the intervenors as old data. And I guess my only comment on that is the pipes aren't getting any younger. And the corrosion keeps on coming. So we think there's really a solid basis for the standpoint of safety. And from the continuing call from the Federal Pipeline Safety Administration to accelerate the replacement of these pipes. But you got a great memory, that study is on record and very supportive of the need to continue for safety reasons, the work we've had underway. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. Thank you, guys. I will see you in a couple of weeks Gale. Bye. Gale Klappa : Sounds good. Look forward to it, Shar. Thank you. Operator : Thanks, Shar. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Security. Neil, please go ahead. Neil Kalton : So quick question on the sort of following up on the initial questions on the S&P program, if that were to come back into play that 800 million? How should we think about the capital allocation at that point, will we reverse some of what we're seeing today or not necessarily? Would it be added if at that point? Gale Klappa : That's a great question, Neil. And I'm going to ask Scott to give you his view on this as well. I would say first of all, it wouldn't be surprising, at least to me if some of the capital that is currently on pause in Illinois would come back simply because of the need to continue safety. So looking at it a little more broadly, Neil, our view is the sweet spot of growth is still 6.5% to 7% a year. So I think we have to see Scott, where we stand in terms of additional infrastructure investments that we have in the pipeline. But as Scott said we have several 100 million dollars of those projects now that are in final due diligence stages. Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes, absolutely. And then when you think about the S&P program, unfortunately, about 1000 workers stopped doing work at the end of the year here. So depending on how long it takes, it may take a while to ramp it up efficiently too. So we'd really evaluate that as we get through these hearings or rehearings. Gale Klappa : Yes, actually, Scott's making a great point. I mean, you can't just turn it on a dime. So if indeed just thinking out loud with you Neil, if indeed, the commission investigation of the program or their review of the need for the program lasts a year, which the order yesterday suggested a year but also said if it could be expedited with all the proper information, they would welcome that. But I wouldn't think that it can be turned on to back to its full level, even if authorized to do so this year. Neil Kalton : Yes. Got it. Makes sense. And one quick follow-up. I couldn't help but notice, I guess we have thought the CapEx coming out 800 million would be replaced one-for-one, instead, I think you've added 300 million to the program. And just curious as to what drove that. Obviously, it entailed a little more equity to do that. Gale Klappa : Yes, Neil. As we continue to get more detailed and granular information about the need to support the economic growth, and particular in the I-94 corridor that we talked about. Clearly, there's going to need to be some additional distribution investment, no question about that. And then there's also some additional renewable need. So those were the two things all regulated all Wisconsin, but really driven by the continued expansion and location and I just mentioned in the script as you may recall, another major investment by a company based in Atlanta called West Rock, with a 587,000, corrugated box production plant. So the economic growth is just amazing. I would encourage anybody. In fact, we are going to invite all of you to come see what we're seeing on the ground here in the not-too-distant future, the economic growth, expansions that we're seeing in that I-94 Corridor are just literally amazing. Operator : Thanks, Neil. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy, please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to kind of come back to Illinois overall here, given the lower-than-expected rate case outcomes from ICC, I think you expected? What's the current view, I guess, in Illinois, as a regulatory jurisdiction here? And how have conversations with stakeholders been trending regarding the longer term outlook for Illinois and gas Illinois? Gale Klappa : Well, I think, clearly, we're going to see a lot more evidence as we move through 2024. Because there are really two dockets now of a very significant importance that are in their absolute beginning stage. The first occurred yesterday, when the Illinois Commission authorized the start of their review of our safety modernization program. And then, they're also beginning this look at which will take we think, at least a year, this look at the future of gas in the state of Illinois. Actually, we're looking forward to both of these dockets. Because there will be broad-based evidence from all kinds of parties, intervenors, across the board, who all have an opinion on this. I would just simply say that, that we're encouraged by the fact that there's going to be open, productive discussion in both of these dockets. And when you step back and think about it, particularly with the fact that we talked about earlier, where from a safety standpoint, these cast iron pipes, 80% of them have a remaining life of less than 15 years. I think at the end of the day, Illinoisans are pretty practical. And at the end of the day, I think we're going to get to a very reasonable point. This policy is just too important to the future, not only from an energy supply standpoint, but from an economic standpoint for the state of Illinois. Scott, you want to add anything to that? Scott Lauber : No, I agree. It just, it'll be good to get the facts on the table and everyone be able to talk about the issues and work through it. So we have a lot of good information and willing to provide it. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. And then just wanted to pivot towards Wisconsin here with the [PFC] [ph], we've seen kind of some rapid turnover, if you will. And just wondering, I guess, updated thoughts on commission outlook and relationships going forward, given changes we have seen? Gale Klappa : Well, I think probably the most significant change, obviously, is Chairman Valcq deciding that she would like to retire from a position and Summer Strand, who was appointed last year by the governor, becoming the new chair. And I would just simply repeat what we've said before about the qualifications that Summer Strand has, in her background and energy policy, her background in construction and engineering, very, very well suited to a position like this. So we're looking forward to working even more closely with Summer. And then the other most recent appointment is a person who's been at the commission and has headed up divisions and staffs at the Commission for I believe, more than a decade. So a good bit of experience to join Summer Strand. And Scott, I think we feel like both of these appointments are very balanced. Scott Lauber : Yes. Very balanced. And having that experience in the commission and be able to fill one of the spots very quickly is good to see. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. And maybe just the last one, if I could just thoughts about the energy infrastructure segment in general, versus the regulated utilities. There was a pivot kind of a way before and then back towards it. And so just wondering how you think about I guess, investments and the two different sides and are you targeting higher returns on the infrastructure business in excess of the authorized ROEs, just wondering, kind of how you see the gives and takes there given the shifts in CapEx in recent years. Gale Klappa : Well, look let me start, and then let Scott give you his view on this as well. Let me start by saying that when we originally laid out our new five-year capital plan, which would have been in early November, it was before obviously the rate order decision in Illinois. Essentially, that plan to achieve a 6.5% to 7% EPS growth, that plan crowded out, if you will, a number of infrastructure projects that we had in the due diligence pipeline. So it really was not all that difficult to begin to look at, what alternatives do we have here for high quality projects? I would say they're kind of two things related to your question. The first is, that we are still seeing a significant number of high quality projects that we're looking at number one, number two, we target in the neighborhood of an 8% unlevered IRR. That's kind of basically the way we look at this, that should result in a return slightly higher than the regulated business. But I would just add, and Scott can add on to this. For a number of the projects, we probably don't talk enough about this. We're building flexibility for our regulated business, particularly Scott for the projects that are in the MISO footprint. Scott Lauber : That's exactly right, Gale. So when these PPAs, lying down at the end, 10, 15 years, we'll have the ability, then perhaps the either repower them, find another off taker, or especially in the MISO footprint, move them into the regulated utility here as we continue to decarbonize. So I think there's a lot of opportunities here. And when we look at these projects, we also look at getting all the cash back within10 years, and for sure, in the time of the PPA. So we're really looking at it is good cash flow, but also opportunities here in the regulated long-term. Gale Klappa : Does that respond to your question? Jeremy Tonet : Yes, that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator : Thanks, Jeremy. And our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh, please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : I'll take you up on that invite. I'm ready to come and bring a bunch of guys and gals with me. So let me know when. Gale Klappa : Excellent, excellent. Very good. Durgesh Chopra : So just clarification on 2024 EPS guidance, does that include the 300 megawatt project that you might be executing on or rather, buying in I think you said the first half the solar project? Gale Klappa : Yes, it does. Yes. And we're in final due diligence right now on that project. However, the project itself is not yet commercial. It's close, but it's not yet commercial. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So in that 4.80 to 4.90 range, we should be modeling like, half a year plus contribution from that project? Gale Klappa : That's fair. Absolutely. That's fair. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. And then maybe just, Xia just can you update us on the timing of equity. I think you're targeting a small amount this year. And then sort of pro rata going forward setting the numbers were 100 million, 200 million this year, and then 450 million a year, starting in 2025. How should we think about that with a slightly higher equity number now. Xia Liu : Nothing is new Durgesh, the 100 to 200 where we're on the way getting there, we turned on the dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans as of January 1 this year. And we have seen shares coming in so far. And traditionally, those programs give us between 100 million to 200 million. If not, we'll turn on the ATM program later in the year. And then going forward, it will be a combination of the benefit programs and the ATM program. Durgesh Chopra : So just to be clear, though, the total equity issuance amount doesn't -- it should still be in that 100 million or 200 million, or I guess what I was really asking is the incremental equity. I know it's small. That's going to be just going to 2025 and beyond. Xia Liu : Correct. Yes. Exactly. Operator : Thanks, Durgesh. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe research. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : I wanted to just parse out the '24 guide a little bit more. How much year-over-year uplift are you getting from the energy infrastructure segment? And can you just confirm the solar project is going to be taking PTC or ITC? Gale Klappa : We'll let Xia give you the breakdown. But the solar project that we're in final due diligence on would be PTCs. Not ITCs, PTCs. So to your point, we're not playing accounting games. We're not trying to take some giant one time, leap forward here. It would be the standard approach that we've used on all of our other infrastructure projects. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes. I would look at it holistically. So 23 to 24, we talked about a reduction from Illinois, that's $0.10 to $0.12. And we have some interest headwinds in the year and a little bit of O&M and offsetting that you would see Wisconsin, ATC and WEC to offset those headwinds. So overall, that's the increase from the 463 to midpoint 485. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And then just sticking with 24, the O&M increase? How much of that was kind of known, I guess, through most of last year? And how much of it popped up more recently? Like, I don't know if you could piece out this January storm? And then these projects that sounds like there's a little bit of lag on, what was kind of like known versus more recent development of the O&M uptick? Gale Klappa : We will let Xia give you the more detailed answer, but long story short, the lion's share of the O&M increase is already recovered in rates. I mean, they were driven by asset additions, been driven mostly by asset additions that have come into service. And were recovered in the last rate cases. Xia? Xia Liu : Yes. And that's it. So about 1%, I call it out 5% of those we already knew, 1% of that was related to storm, the rest would be the O&M related to assets in the rate cases, as well as additional WEC infrastructure projects. Michael Sullivan : I'm sorry. Go ahead, Gale. Gale Klappa : No, I was just going to say if you just think about it broadly, as we add assets, you add O&M to basically operate those assets. And we added a considerable, I mean, we added a considerable number of renewable assets, infrastructure projects, et cetera. But if you look at core O&M, I mean, core O&M is very, very under control. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Just can you put the storm one time and like an earnings per share basis? Gale Klappa : Scott, I think we're talking the January storm, 8 million \u2013 Scott Lauber : It's about $0.02. Michael Sullivan : $0.02, okay. Okay, and then, thanks for all that. And then kind of just shifting to this upcoming Wisconsin rate case. Any like high level sense of the size of the rate increase we should be anticipating there. Gale Klappa : Scott, go ahead. Scott Lauber : So we're currently pulling all those numbers together. As you can tell, we've been working on filling in the hole from the Illinois capitol, but we're currently working on those numbers, you know, we got these asset additions that we're putting in this year. And of course, there'll be some inflation as we look at O&M. So we don't have a final number yet. But we should know by the end of the first quarter here when we file something. But everything seems reasonable if you're pulling stuff together. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Like within the range of where the last case was, in terms of like opening ask, ballpark, is that fair? Gale Klappa : Yes. I doubt it to be higher than that. It'll be in that ballpark or a little less. I would think. We're still pulling those together, though. We got to factor a lot of stuff in and look at like the production tax credits. We're getting on the solar that just went into service and factoring that all in. You'll see the filing in the second quarter. Operator : All right. Thanks, Michael. And our next question comes from the line Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew, please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Two quick follow ups on the commissioners in Wisconsin, so obviously some new faces their. First question just to confirm that turnover won't have any impact on the timing or outcome of the rate case, or well, I shouldn't say outcome. It won't impact the timing right. Gale Klappa : Now, the timing has been set by commission policy, I would expect no change. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. The other question I had relates to former commissioner Kyler Huebner, he was ousted if you will by the Republican led Senate, and a lot of the media reports make it sound like a lot of the pushback from that Senate was around his support for renewables and solar in particular. So my question is, do you worry that the state's commitment to renewables might potentially be changing politically? And if so, would that impact your spending strategy at all? Gale Klappa : Short answer is no. And in fact, I don't know what you were reading. But I really don't think his support for renewables or solar was really a deciding factor in the Senate vote at all. I would just ask you to go back and perhaps read some of the other. Actually, there are very specific comments that were made by members of the Senate Energy Committee news releases that were put out after the fact explaining the action. But it wasn't, at least in our view, it was not at all related to the fact that that he felt a certain amount of renewables were needed. Not at all. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. That's reassuring. Then just a very quick follow up on equity, I understand the slightly higher equity related to the higher CapEx. What about the write down following the Illinois rate case in disallowances? Are you not expecting that to lead to additional equity? Or are you awaiting results of rehearings or potential court cases before you decide? Xia Liu : That write down the additional equity will extend down to Illinois that's already in the five year plan? It's included in the new equity numbers I gave you. Gale Klappa : So we've already baked it into the five year plan. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Paul, please go ahead. Paul Fremont : I guess my first question is, does when you look at sort of the 28 outlook for the company, the 5% decrease in the natural gas distribution segment? What does that assume in terms of outcomes in Illinois? Gale Klappa : It assumes a status quo. Because we just don't know exactly the outcome of the safety modernization review. Scott? Scott Lauber : Right. So it assumes that we will still be doing emergency work and work for the city, and some of those real reliability needs. But for assuming the status, until they get through the system, they'll have a safety modernization program and review that neighborhood program. We don't have any of that in there. Gale Klappa : So Scott is right. It assumes some spending because we have to do emergency work related to it. If you can't fix a pipe and you have to replace it, we have to do that emergency work. And we really do need to cooperate with the city of Chicago when they're replacing their water mains, for example. So but beyond that, it does not assume any return to the full, roughly 280 million a year, it does not assume that. Paul Fremont : And presumably, I mean, if the outcome were favorable in Illinois, would that potentially change upward? Gale Klappa : It certainly could, we'll just have to see the outcome. And we probably won't know more on that though, until what do you think Scott \u2013 Scott Lauber : Late at the end of next year, the same time this year, it's going to take a while to get through, which is the only one to be thorough, so that's good. Gale Klappa : And because it's not only a specific look at the safety modernization program, but with a separate docket on the future of gas, there will be broad policy decisions within a year we believe. Paul Fremont : Right. And then, can you discuss what comprises the added infrastructure investment? Is that all essentially renewable investment? Gale Klappa : Oh, yes. Yes, largely solar. But yes, all renewable. Paul Fremont : Great. And any update on the tender or and where are you in the tender because the early period, I think expired. When does the tender expire? Gale Klappa : Xia has all the details for you. And yes, the early tender has run its course. Xia Liu : Yes. The early tender has expired. We expect to tender, a little over $120 million out of the 500 million, all that is coming together. Paul Fremont : And you're still waiting for the regular tender to expire, right? Xia Liu : Correct. But given the expiration of the early tender, we don't expect much pickup after the early expiration date. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then I guess, last question, when would we see sort of the annual breakouts of the change in your spending some of the words, the five year numbers? Xia Liu : We have that in the 10-K. So we'll issue the 10-K in February, and then we have a February investor deck, which will give you the details for the next three years. Operator : Thanks, Paul. And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien, the floor is yours. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, look, let's bring it back to your neck of the woods. Super quick. There's been a lot of conversation on all sides of legislation in Illinois, and a lot of different parties coming to the table obviously doesn't seem entirely ripe or obvious where that's going. But, how do you see that kind of meshing up against these various dockets with a future gas? Or, frankly, your own rehearing? We just kind of getting a cohesive set of policies maybe aligning with the governor round, or what have you. I mean, how do you see that possibly coming together? Like, what venue, even if you will? Gale Klappa : Well, I think I'm not sure if there's a clear answer to that. But I can give you my opinion. And once you know of my opinion on this because there's not a clear answer, it could be wrong. But my sense is that every major step that we're going to see going forward, is going to be under the umbrella of implementing what we call CEJA, the Clean Energy Jobs Act. And I think that you see that path very clearly discussed with by Chairman Scott, as he talks about his decisions and the Commission's decisions being tied to implementation of that Clean Energy Jobs Act. So that's, I think, the framework or the umbrella under which a lot of all of these dockets are going to proceed, if you will. And I think the Chairman sees his job as his mandate from the governor of basically putting into action, that piece of legislation. And one of the most important steps now is going to be at the commission. And with that docket, that they've now just authorized, looking at the future of gas in the state of Illinois. And again, that's going to be very open, very productive. I think. All the stakeholders are going to have their say. And I would just say to you at the end of the day, Midwesterners, Illinoisans are pretty practical people. So I think we're going to end up with a practical result. That would be my projection at the end of all of those discussions. Scott, anything to add? Scott Lauber : No, nothing additional. I agree with you. We'll probably go through that process. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I know, it's a little opaque at the time for the time being but appreciate it. Look, actually related, if we can just talk about QIP, I mean, obviously, there's an element of trying to get recovery here of spending, is there any portion of spending that can be funneled through, that are or related riders here. I mean, how do you think about, lag in the context of spending in Illinois. I mean, obviously, you're pulling back on spending here, but I just want to try to make sure we kind of calibrate accordingly to how to think about the business and the ability to earn, you're at or near your authorized, if you will? Gale Klappa : Well, I think it's a great question. I think the short answer is really to be found in the docket that now is being authorized. And we'll come to a conclusion by June 1, or we expect early June at the latest. So there were under that safety modernization program, you call it QIP, which was the piece of legislation that authorized a rider to recover these investments a bill rider. There were several buckets of activity that were included in that legislation and recovered through that rider. One of the buckets, we feel just has to continue, as Scott mentioned earlier, it's the emergency work. And it's the work that, for example, we do in conjunction with the city of Chicago, they are actively replacing aging water mains, and it doesn't make a lot of sense to rip up the streets twice. So we work together. And we work together very well, to accomplish what we need to accomplish as they were doing their work. That bucket also got paused in the Commission's order, as well as the big piece of the plan, which is the neighborhood work, going neighborhood by neighborhood based on risk, to upgrade the safety and put a new modern state-of-the-art piping. So the piece that we're saying to them, that look, we really need to continue and get appropriate recovery for is $134 million. It's that bucket of work, relating to emergencies, things that we have to do and to work, for example, like with the city of Chicago. So that piece is what we're asking for recovery on. And we should get an answer, Scott, I believe by early June. Scott Lauber : Yes. We expect that in June. And then the remaining as you look at the neighborhood programs, and we think it'll take about a year to go through the docket. That then would have to be looked at in a forward-looking test yard imagine as we put rates together. So it'd be really two steps here. Gale Klappa : I was just going to say watch the space. There'll be a lot of activity over the course of the next 12 months. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Excellent. All right. Well, look, I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys, very much for the details and best of luck, and I'm sure I'll see you guys soon. All right. Take care. Operator : Thanks, Julian. And our final question today comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul, please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Following up on Julien's question on rate lag, as you've I'm sure aware that you were one of -- a number of decisions that happen late in 2023 that were not what the utilities kind of expected. And, as you know, Gale, you've been doing this a long time. We may be entering into an environment where there just is less appetite for the CapEx spending and more of a desire for bang for the buck kind of approach or regulatory lag, as Julien was bringing up? I guess I'm sort of a bigger picture question. A, mean, at least what I'm looking at that. That's what I see. If you disagree, let me know. And then secondly, how do you think because you've been doing this a long time, and you've seen this kind of environment in the past, I'm sure what -- how you might approach a situation in which there's just a hesitancy to continue with mechanisms like the S&P or at least augmenting them or changing them in such a way that, that it might be a bit more of a challenge. So just wanted to, this is one of your big picture if you could sort of address that. Gale Klappa : Yes, be happy to. And as you ask the question, there are two specific things that really come to my mind. The first is that, I mean, we're obviously only going to make investments that follow public policy, and public policy of a safety modernization program on the future of gas in Illinois are going to be decided in the next 12 months. Having said that, I believe there's a certain amount of investment that's simply going to have to take place for the safety of Chicagoans. What amount that is, I don't know, in terms of what decision might be made. But I can't imagine the Safety Modernization Program. Maybe it's changed, maybe it's not, but I can't imagine that investment going to zero. Just from a pure practical standpoint, I don't think that's feasible in terms of protecting the City of Chicago, or preparing the City of Chicago for an energy future that could include renewable natural gas, hydrogen, or any other type of fuel. So that's kind of piece one. Piece two, just remember that under normal circumstances, Illinois as a future test period, their rate cases have a one year future test period, which does help to mitigate any kind of issue related to regulatory lag on a normal ongoing basis. And then I guess the other thing that I would add is, you look at just the adjustments we've made since November 16, in our capital plan. I mean, I mentioned earlier, three mega trends are driving the kind of investment opportunity that we have in front of us, which is robust. And those three mega trends are basically reliability, the incredible economic growth that we're seeing in terms of expansion and attraction here of businesses, and industrial customers, and in the third and these are all important decarbonization. So I don't see regardless of the outcome in Illinois, any type of really diminished opportunity, Scott, in terms of the broad, broad avenues that we have for productive investment that support those trends. Scott Lauber : No. When you're looking at it, what do you think about the decarbonization, it's more than that, because a lot of these power plants that are retiring, it's either invest hundreds of millions of dollars there, or in a carbon free resource and doesn't cost anything for the fuel. So there's also cost savings there to long term with the production tax credit. So, we do have a lot of opportunities here. Gale Klappa : Paul, does that respond? Paul Patterson : I appreciate it. Gale Klappa : All right. Well, I think we wore you guys out today. So that concludes our conference call for this afternoon. Thank you so much for your questions and for participating as always, and if you have any additional thoughts or questions, Beth Straka is happy to pick up the phone. She can be reached at 414-221-4639 Thanks, everybody. See you along. Operator : Thanks, Gale. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

[Operator Instructions] In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.  Before the conference call begins, please note that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.  In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.  And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Gale Klappa : Live from the Heartland. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2024. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.  Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2024 earnings of $1.97 a share. Throughout the warmest winter in Wisconsin history, we remain laser-focused on financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction and we're confident that we can deliver another year of strong results in line with our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share for the full year. This, of course, assumes normal weather as always going forward.  Switching gears now. We're off to a strong start moving forward with our ESG progress plan. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $23.7 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. In the past few weeks alone, we filed with the Wisconsin Commission more than $2 billion of projects that are needed to meet customer demand across the region. In addition, just a few days ago, we announced that we plan to purchase a 90% ownership interest in the Delilah 1 solar project. Delilah is a 300-megawatt solar park in Northeast Texas. It will be the next addition to our WEC Infrastructure segment. We expect to close on Delilah with an investment of $459 million when the project goes into service, and that's currently expected by the end of June.  Since the beginning of the year, we also purchased an additional 10% interest in the Samson Solar project, now that's part of the Samson and Delilah development in Northeast Texas. And we plan to increase our ownership in the Maple Flats Solar Energy Center from 80% to 90%. Just as a reminder, Maple Flats is under development in South Central Illinois. It has an offtake agreement with a Fortune 100 company for all the energy it will produce. The project should be in service by the end of this year.  So to sum it up, with Delilah and with the increase in ownership of Samson and Maple Flats, we'll be investing an additional $560 million this year in our Infrastructure segment. As you recall, we're reallocating away from our operations in Illinois a total of $800 million over the 5-year period, 2024 through 2028. These high-quality 0 carbon projects clearly go a long way toward achieving that goal. And each of these projects meets our strict financial criteria.  Overall, the building blocks of our capital plan show even stronger growth in our regulated electric business. And our plan fully supports our long-term earnings growth rate which we project to be in the 6.5% to 7% range on a compound average annual basis.  And now turning to the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. In fact, Wisconsin recently reached a new record for employment, more people working than at any other time in state history. And that includes a record folks for the number of construction jobs. That's a great sign of the growth and the potential we're seeing, particularly in what we call the I-94 corridor.  To give you just one example of the new economic activity in the region. Just a few weeks ago, electronic components that are used in fiber broadband networks began rolling off the assembly line at a state-of-the-art facility developed by Sanmina Corporation. These components help form the backbone for high-speed Internet service.  And we want to welcome Eli Lilly to our neighborhood. The Pharmaceutical giant is purchasing a new production facility, again, in the I-94 corridor. And speaking of growth, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead on the construction of a massive data center complex in the I-94 corridor south of Milwaukee. In fact, in the next few weeks, Microsoft is planning an event here in the Milwaukee area to discuss its plans for new investments in Wisconsin. So stay tuned.  And looking broadly across the landscape, I can tell you that the number of prospects looking at expanding or locating in the Milwaukee 7 region is stronger literally than at any time in the past 2 decades.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. In Wisconsin, we filed new rate reviews for test years 2025 and 2026 on April 12. Our request focus on addressing 3 major areas of need. First, improving reliability and reducing outages from increased storm activity; second, supporting Wisconsin's economic growth and job creation through investments in new generation and distribution projects; and lastly, complying with the new EPA mission rules by continuing the transition from coal generation to renewables and natural gas. We expect the decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025. Last month, we submitted filings to the Wisconsin Commission for significant developments to support our electric generation business. Our proposed projects include 2 new sources of natural gas generation. The first request is for approval to construct 1,100 megawatts of modern simple cycle combustion turbines at our existing Oak Creek power plant site. The expected investment is $1.2 billion.  To support that generation, we are proposing to build a 33-mile lateral with an expected investment of approximately $180 million. This lateral would provide firm reliability of natural gas to the Oak Creek site for those units as well as our Power the Future units that we're converting to natural gas. And to help to share reliability, we are proposing a new storage facility at Oak Creek, with a planned investment of approximately $460 million. This facility would have the capacity to store 2 billion cubic feet a liquefied natural gas to support both our generation and our gas distribution system.  In addition, we requested approval to add 128 megawatts of state-of-the-art generation using reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. We expect to invest approximately $280 million in that project near our Paris Generation Station. As a reminder, these investments are expected to earn AFUDC during the construction period.  We also have smaller rate reviews in progress at our 2 Michigan utilities. Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources. These applications are primarily driven by our capital investments supporting reliability and safety.  As you recall, our discussion last quarter on the recent developments in Illinois. There are 3 dockets we're actively engaged in at this time. First, the Illinois Commission granted us a limited rehearing focused on the request to restore $145 million for the safety modernization program in 2024. This mostly relates to emergency work, work that was in progress and work driven by public entities like the City of Chicago. This limited rehearing is now underway, and we expect to receive a final commission order by June 1.  The other 2 outstanding dockets are expected to span at least a year, and we are actively involved. One is a full review of the safety modernization program and the other is an evaluation of the future of gas in Illinois. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.  Now turning to our capital plan. We're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. Our Ixonia LNG storage facility is now in service, this additional 1 Bcf of storage will be necessary during the extreme weather events we see here in Wisconsin. Also, the Wisconsin Commission has approved our purchase of 100 megawatts of additional capacity at West Riverside Energy Center. We expect to invest approximately $100 million to add this capacity to our electric business in the second quarter.  At the same time, we're continuing the efforts to phase out older, less efficient coal generation. In fact, I'm happy to report that we're on track to retire Unit 5 and 6 of our Oak Creek power plant later this month. These changes support our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It's a busy and strong start to the year. Our capital plan is robust and highly executable, and we continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business.  With that, I'll turn things back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Scott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7%. This marks, ladies and gentlemen, the 21st consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future.  Next up, Xia will provide us with more details on our financial results for the quarter and our guidance for Q #2. Xia? Liu Xia : Thank you, Gale. Our 2024 first quarter earnings of $1.97 per share increased $0.36 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers.  Starting with our utility operations. Our earnings were $0.28 higher compared to the first quarter of 2023. Weather had an estimated $0.07 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. As noted earlier, this past winter was the warmest in Wisconsin history. The milder weather, along with $0.09 from higher depreciation and amortization, interest expense and day-to-day O&M expense were more than offset by the following positive variances.  Timing of fuel expense was a $0.09 increase quarter-over-quarter. Our fuel was in a positive recovery position at the end of Q1 this year, compared to an under-recovered position at the end of Q1 last year. And rate base growth contributed $0.35 to earnings quarter-over-quarter. This includes the rate increases from Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan.  One thing to note, as I mentioned on our year-end call, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are even more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters when natural gas usage is the highest and this earnings shift is a significant driver for the quarter. Looking ahead, we'll see the opposite shift in Q2 and Q3.  Before I turn to earnings at the Other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather normal sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. While weather was historically mild in the quarter, our weather-normal gas and electric deliveries were both relatively flat and overall in line with our forecast. However, on the electric side, our residential and small commercial and industrial segments are currently ahead of forecast.  Now at our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings increased $0.02 in the first quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter of '23. Production tax credits were higher quarter-over-quarter resulting from production at our Samsung and Sapphire Sky renewable generation projects, both of which were acquired in February 2023.  Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment rose $0.06, primarily driven by timing of tax. In closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 24 earnings guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we're implementing a variety of initiatives. For example, we now expect our '24 day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than '23 versus our previous expectation of 6% to 7% higher. The lion's share of the reduction is expected to come in the second half of the year.  For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.60 to $0.64 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.92 per share in the second quarter last year. While the Q2 guidance range is lower, if you combine Q1 actual and Q2 guidance, we expect to be $0.04 to $0.08 ahead of the first quarter of '23.  With that, I'll turn it back to Gale. Gale Klappa : Great. Thank you, Xia. And now a final note. We did some quick math this morning. And today marks the 87th time that I've had the privilege of hosting an analyst call, starting back in the day at Brand X and then continuing through the past 21 years here at WEC. Together, we've covered a lot of history and a ton of progress. I can tell you that your thoughtful questions and your thorough analysis have helped us to build and sustain a premier company on a mission that truly matters. And for that, I'm grateful. Going forward on these calls, you'll be hearing from Scott and Xia, they are ready, and it's their time to shine.  And operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. James Kennedy : It's actually James on for Shar. So the first -- the $400 million of the equity in your current 5-year plan was put there to true-up utility equity layers? In your current Wisconsin rate cases, you're asking for 53.5% equity or 50 basis points above where you indicate current levels to be. Could we see incremental equity being added to the current plan to true those utilities up that 50 basis points? Gale Klappa : I think the short answer is no, Shar. I'm thinking of Shar in a closet somewhere. Xia, go ahead. Liu Xia : I mean, we filed for 53.5%. We hope to receive 53.5%. If that's the case, we'll look at the equity. But right now, we haven't changed the equity plan. James Kennedy : Got it. There's no change now, but if you were to get it, there's the possibility, it's not already included in the plan, I guess, is really what you just clarify. Gale Klappa : No, but I wouldn't model in at this stage of the game or even after we get it. I wouldn't necessarily model in an increase in equity beyond that. Scott Lauber : And I think when you look at it and you look at the details of our filing and -- when you look at the details of the filing and the regulatory ratio, it's about the same as it is this year, right now, you got to look at the financial and the regulatory ratios. Gale Klappa : Yes. Did that help, James... James Kennedy : Perfect. Very clear. Absolutely. And then one more also on the rate cases. In your last set of Wisconsin cases, the settlements that you negotiated didn't quite hold up as filed, even though those in prior cases had. Given that precedent, but also that you have a new slate of commissioners in office, how should we think about settlements in Wisconsin today? And kind of what are some of the pushes and takes and maybe how should we think about potential timing for a settlement, if any, in these cases? And that's all I got. Gale Klappa : Very good. Well, a couple of thoughts on your questions about settlements and timing. First of all, I think that our current a new chair of the commission, Summer Strand, has publicly stated that she's very open to stakeholder input and would certainly be open to discussions on settlement. So I think essentially, the door is open for negotiations at the appropriate time. And then in terms of timing itself, historically, the best time for really candid and thorough discussions comes after the staff audit is complete.  And Scott, when would you expect on this particular case, the staff audit to come out, mid-summer, maybe? Scott Lauber : Probably near the end of summer, at the end of summer. Gale Klappa : And of course, a final decision is not statutorily required until December in the case. So there's a window between the time of the staff audit and commission deliberations for all the appropriate stakeholders to get together. I hope that helps. Operator : We will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Gale, well, finally, the day came. Well, I appreciate all 87 of those calls, which I probably either listen to or read the transcript of all of them. So -- but wish you the best. But I'm not going to let you get away without answering some questions. So just -- you brought up the Microsoft announcement potentially coming soon and I guess there's already kind of been announcements, but just could you give a little more color kind of what else they might be talking about? Is it -- is there kind of an expansion of maybe the build-out that they're looking at. And just how do we think about just -- are you -- from a supply standpoint, are you basically the supplier for all their electricity? And are you kind of -- how are you making sure that you're kind of doing at the right margins and just how we should think about both the tariff margin and CapEx potential? Gale Klappa : Yes. Terrific. Great question, Steve. I mean, first of all, to answer your second question, yes, we will be the supplier for all of the energy that Microsoft will need at their site inside the Wisconsin Technology Park, which, as you know, is about 20 miles south of our headquarter city.  In terms of what's changed, what's different? I mean, Microsoft early on in their whole process here in Wisconsin acquired 315 acres of property adjacent to the area that Foxconn is developing in that technology park. So what you see in our current 5-year capital plan is the generation that we expect to need to add to essentially serve what is being built and it's being built quickly. My Gosh, there are like 10 to 12 cranes active, the construction site is incredibly active right now. But it's active on the first 315 acres, Microsoft has developed. So we're thinking about that pending ongoing discussions with Microsoft as kind of the first phase because Microsoft has now acquired substantial additional acreage. In fact, they control 1,345 acres now in that technology park. And they're clearly working very hard and have discussions with our folks every single week on as they develop their plans for the rest of that development. And I think we'll hear more from Microsoft on their broader plan for Wisconsin here in the next few weeks.  So I hope that helps. And how are we planning to make sure we're serving their needs? I mean, literally, their technical folks and ours are in weekly discussions, very encouraging. Hope that responds, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Yes. No, that's great. Just -- can you just remind me just for the first 315 acres, how much capital is in your plan to basically make the investment to serve that? Gale Klappa : Yes. Essentially, there's other -- as we've talked about, there's other significant economic growth in that area as well. So in the capital plan, for -- to meet what we see on the ground. This is not speculation about future economic growth. This is what we see on the ground, what we knew from Microsoft back in November, what we're actually seeing from HARIBO, from -- now from Eli Lilly and others, we added 1,400 megawatts of dispatchable capacity to the plan. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then one other question just on Illinois. The -- obviously, the order late last year disappointing, but staff on rehearing kind of seemed okay. So just feeling that likely the commission will be reasonable there. And I guess, maybe more importantly, there's been a lot of labor pushback on the capital -- on the work reductions. And just is that making any impact on just how the state is looking at things for your business? Gale Klappa : Well, I'll ask Scott to give his view on this as well. From my observation, Steve, I would say that every intervener has taken a position. As you say, the staff is supportive of the work continuing that we asked to have allowed to be continued and to be recovered. Virtually all of the intervenors have suggested that at least some amount of work continue. But this is the first time on our rehearing that this particular commission is going to make a decision. So time will tell, but we won't have to wait long. Scott, I believe we're looking at probably the end of May. Scott Lauber : Yes, it should -- we should hear something here by the end of May, early part June on the decision here. And I know safety and reliability is at their forefront. And we hear a lot of that in the future of natural gas that they talk about safety and reliability on those cases, too. So looking forward to a good decision, but we'll see what happens. Gale Klappa : And Steve, my gut tells me that there's an element of practicality, just Midwest practicality here as it relates to making sure that, that system stays safe. Operator : We will take our next question from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Neil Kalton : So anyway, a question just kind of following on, on some of the earlier conversation on the new generation that you're adding about 1,400 megawatts. I understand that's for what you see on the ground. At that point in time, what will the reserve margins look like? Basically, what I'm trying to get at is there seems like there's a lot of additional activity that could happen. And what would your -- what would be your ability to serve or would we be looking at new generation requirements if that were to come online? Gale Klappa : Well, the 14 -- based on the demand forecast we had when we put the 5-year plan together, remember, we rolled that out in November. Basically, the 5-year plan took us to what we call a balanced reserve margin. meeting the capacity requirements that we're expected to have and to be accredited by MISO. So any -- I think the bottom line for -- at least from my view, and we'll ask Scott to give you his. But the bottom line from my view is if we see, as we roll forward here in the next few months, which I think which we're seeing, I mean, additional economic development and projects going in, then that's going to mean we have to build more. Scott? Scott Lauber : You're exactly correct, Gale. As we continue to look at it, and we did size our plan with the required reserve margins, looking at the seasonal capacity that's required from the Midwest operator here. So any additional load, we will need some generation to make sure we have that capacity available. Gale Klappa : So stay tuned. There'll be a new update coming in the fall. Operator : We will take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : So listen, so Gale, do you -- I guess, just from your perspective and the team's perspective, do you worry about the pace at which the data center deployment is projected to kind of occur? I'm thinking about how fast they're building, you just alluded to your active conversations versus sort of your construction cycle, getting approvals and all the sort of the road blocks or the milestones that you need to kind of check to get the generation there. Is that something that concerns you? Gale Klappa : Just in terms of the amount of time it takes to get approvals. Is that what you're referring to, Durgesh? Durgesh Chopra : Yes. Just the generation, whatever distribution assets you need, the approvals and just the expedited time line of these hyperscalers. Gale Klappa : Yes. Good question. And I would kind of -- and Scott should give you his view as well. I would kind of break it down into 3 buckets. And the first bucket is obviously availability of equipment. And there we're fortunate in that we have already placed a number of orders for some of the key -- particularly key transmission and distribution pieces of equipment that will be needed.  Secondly, very positively so in this particular technology park, we're allowed to build certain distribution assets and transmission assets that do not have to take a year of approval. So that's really already underway. And then the other piece would be just the regulatory approval. And in Wisconsin to get what we call the CPCN, basically approval to build generation. The CPCN can take up to a year. I will say this, I think the staff and the commissioners here in Wisconsin are very aware of the need for speed here and the governor has himself promised Microsoft that the state will do what's necessary to help them be successful here.  So clearly, this is major. I mean, clearly, there's a lot of work to be done. But right now, we're off to a really good start. And I think the backdrop here and the regulatory support will be very strong to make sure that we meet the need and serve Foxconn -- all of the folks there. But not only Foxconn, but Microsoft well. Scott? Scott Lauber : I agree, Gale. And I think the other key is we have the site selection at the Oak Creek site for a significant part of our assets. And we've done a lot of the filings already. So really, things are moving ahead very quickly. But we got a process in place in the orders placed, which is good. Gale Klappa : Yes. Scott is actually making a very good point about site selection. I mean we've had a power generation campus at Oak Creek literally for the last 70 years. We have buffer property there. We have a property that will easily house, particularly the combustion turbines that Scott talked about earlier. The 1,100 megawatts of combustion turbines that will be an important part of the next addition of assets that we need to have.  I hope that responds, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : That is very, very helpful. I appreciate all the color there. Maybe can I just quickly follow up on Illinois, the limited rehearing. Is there a potential for settlement there? Can you settle with the parties potentially those Part A and Part B? Does it have to be 0 or 145? Or can it be sort of a spend number, which is in between? Gale Klappa : No, it can be a spend number anywhere in between. There really is in this limited rehearing process, if you will. There's really no avenue for settlement. But you're right, it's not a binary thing. It's not 0 or 145. The commissioners can use judgment on any number from 0 to 145 or in between. Operator : We will take our next question from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just to start, I wanted to just ask on the electric sales this quarter, you walked through some of the weather impacts, but anything else that you flag driving some of the C&I load for the quarter, particularly for the larger customers there? And then as you just think about some of these economic development opportunities, how you think about really that timing for an inflection in load growth? Gale Klappa : Well, we've already -- and we will ask Xia to give you, she's got a couple of very good important details, particularly about the large industrial activity that we saw in Q1 here. Let me just say 2 quick things.  First of all, as mild as the weather was and as far from normal as it was, I would suggest that you take the actual weather normal sales numbers with a bit of a grain of salt. Some of you heard me say this forever, but our weather normalization techniques that are used in our industry just don't bear up well when you get 1.5, 2 standard deviations away from norm. So read our numbers for Q1 on weather normal is more precise than accurate.  Secondly, we've already shown, as you probably saw, as we've gone through some of our plans, we've already shown a nice uptick in annual projections of energy sales starting in 2026. You remember, we basically, for the past decade or so have been growing at 0.5%, 0.7% in terms of annual kilowatt hour sales. We moved that up based on everything we were seeing last November on the ground. We moved that up to 4.5% to 5% starting in 2026.  I'm guessing that you'll see that number grow when the plan gets updated as we normally do in the fall. I mean just from everything else that seems to be occurring here post when we put the plan together, last fall. And then in terms of specifics on Q1 in terms of industrial, Xia? Liu Xia : Yes. So on Q1, so to your point, Carly, the weather normal LC&I electric sales was minus 1.8%, which was behind our forecast. But if you -- we looked pretty hard on the specifics. So it turned out that the underperformance was concentrated in really a couple of customers, one in primary metal, the other in the paper sector. And one of them actually is in the process of transition into a very -- a much bigger expanded presence in the region. So Q1 was kind of a transition period for them. So that's really just timing.  If you excluded those customers, LC&I sales would have been 0.4% higher compared to Q1 last year. So we're not worried about the LC&I sales trend. Carly Davenport : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Maybe if I could just squeeze one more in. You referenced the new EPA rules in terms of some spend there in the Wisconsin rate cases just filed. I guess, do you expect those new rules to have any impact on the views on gas capacity additions going forward or the capital needs associated with that? Gale Klappa : No. It's a good question. And the short answer is no, compared to what we filed. And I will say a real shout out to our generation and environmental planning folks. They've done a great job of anticipating the new EPA rules. And Scott, based on everything we've seen that's come out in the last couple of weeks, we're right on track. Scott Lauber : No, our plan that we filed and the plan we have in our 5-year plan lines up right in line with the EPA rules that just came out were finalized. So I'm very happy to see that come together. Operator : And we will take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Congratulations and best of luck and best of luck to Shar in the closet also. So great news all around. I guess also Neil and Steve's question, I apologize if you answered it, just I guess you talked about you have an adequate reserve margin in the service territory and if a large data center hyperscale that comes in, and they eat up that entire reserve margin and now the generations need to get back. Just on the allocation of cost for the data center moving in there and maybe eating up that reserve margin, does the rest of this jurisdiction bear the cost of now building back up the reserve margin? Gale Klappa : No. And I'm glad you asked the question actually because we should be very, very clear about that. First of all, Microsoft has said time and time and again that they want to and will pay their fair share. And we're working on a specific rate for them that will have several components. It will have essentially a component for generation capacity basically, they'll have to pay for their fair share of the generation that's needed. They will have to pay a small amount. There will be a little bit of distribution, but they will pay for the distribution investment that serves them.  Energy will be a pass-through as it is for many, many of our large industrial customers that we have on what we call real-time pricing. And so essentially, we're working on very specific components of a rate. It's not hugely -- Scott, it's not hugely dissimilar from what we're doing for other large industrial customers. Scott Lauber : Now it's -- we're laying out a plan for that, like Gale said, they want to pay their fair share. I wouldn't characterize it as them eating into reserve margins. Some of this builders support that. So we always look at our plan and make sure we have the appropriate reserve margin and we look at this economic development. Once again, that's what drove some of the generation here. So I don't think they ate into anything. It's just all additive for everybody here. Gale Klappa : And then, Anthony, as you know well because you've been around a long time, when you have substantial kilowatt hour sales growth, that actually is helpful to your customer base. Because it spreads those additional costs over a much broader base of kilowatt hour sales. So there's also as we work our way through this, remember that 4.5% to 5% increase that we're projecting in annual kilowatt hour sales starting in '26. That's also going to be helpful as well to our overall customer base. Anthony Crowdell : Got it. And then if I could just one follow-up. Steve's question earlier about maybe some of the pushback in Illinois from the labor group. I'm just wondering, do you believe labor still has maybe the same, I don't know political leverage is the right term, but the same maybe sway that they've had in years past. Do you think it's more or just kind of the same? And I'll leave it there. Gale Klappa : Anthony, it's very hard to tell. I mean, incrementally one way or the other. But I will say this, labor has and will continue to have, I believe, a strong voice in Illinois, and they are passionate about the need for us to continue the safety modernization program. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And again, congratulations. Operator : And we will take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Congratulations. So I guess my question is the future of gas. You brought it up. And I know it's kind of early procedurally, but any sense as to when that might be wrapped up in Illinois? Gale Klappa : A long time. What is going on right now and started a couple of months ago is really what they would call a scoping phase. So they're having almost weekly meetings to identify and get broad input on all the different sub subjects or sub subject matters that should have broad discussion from all the stakeholders going forward. So the scoping itself, I think, is going to take until mid-summer. Our guess is probably when do you think Scott, at least a year. Scott Lauber : Yes. It's supposed to -- the scoping is going to go to about the end of August, and then it will be another year after that, that they built through the investigation and the policy that may have to come out of it. But one of the things the ICC is really doing though is making sure they hear everybody's voice in this. So they're getting a lot of people involved, which is good to get all the different issues and circumstances on the table. So they're trying to be a real robust process here. Gale Klappa : I did notice, Paul yesterday or day before that one of the environmental groups and again -- multiple stakeholders taking place in the scoping process but one of the environmental groups on the record did say that they believe there would have to be a very long transition and that natural gas would play a significant role for a long period of time, which I thought was both practical, accurate and encouraging. Paul Patterson : Yes. And I guess, also considering that so much of your CapEx is safety-oriented. I would assume that it doesn't really -- the idea that this is going on doesn't really probably impact your current investment in the business? If you follow... Gale Klappa : I think that's reasonably -- yes, that's reasonably accurate, Paul. Yes. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just one of the things that we've been seeing a lot of officials talking about recently per commissioner about -- a lot about this enhanced grid enhancement technologies. And I was just wondering how you guys as an industry leader are sort of thinking about the deployment of this and how it might impact the industry as you're -- as you guys are thinking about just sort of longer term -- what do you guys see this as being -- how it might be playing a role or not in your business? Gale Klappa : Well, early days, Paul, but my sense -- and we'll get Scott for you as well, my sense is probably the first application maybe in transmission. What do you think, Scott? Scott Lauber : Yes. We're going to have a lot of technology on the system. So it's hard to decide what exactly new technology will be coming, but we have a lot of automation that we put on the system that you can really see are very effective when there is a storm that rolls through. So I think the technology will continue to improve and I think transmission and whether you do dynamic line ratings and stuff, you're going to continue to see the benefits of technology. And I think just like anything else, it continues to evolve here and we get better and better at it. Gale Klappa : In near term, as Scott has mentioned the dynamic line ratings, I think, pay attention to that because I think that could be very helpful. But there's a lot -- as you know, there's a lot of R&D underway to try to enhance both reliability and stability. So I hope that gives you at least a broad answer to the question, Paul. Paul Patterson : Absolutely. I appreciate it. Once again, congratulations, and good luck. Gale Klappa : Thank you, Paul. You take care.  All right. Well, folks, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for taking part. If you have more questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka. She can be reached at (414) 221-4639. So long, everybody. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts and questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted on wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. Before the conference call begins, please note that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. And it's now my pleasure to introduce Scott Lauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Scott Lauber : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2024. Here with me today are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2024 earnings of $0.67 per share. We're firmly on track to meet the full-year 2024 guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the balance of the year. We continue to see strong foundational growth in our regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 2.9%, continuing a long-running trend below the national average. The pipeline of economic activity is particularly strong in what we call the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago. For example, just last month, WestRock broke ground on a new facility at the former site of our retired power plants. WestRock is a leading company in paper and packaging solutions with 50,000 employees and 300 plants worldwide. The company called the cutting-edge facility a super plant, stating it will be one of their largest and most advanced plants. And Microsoft is making good progress on the construction of a large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin. In May, Microsoft announced a broad investment package to strengthen our region as a hub for AI economic activity, innovation and job creation. These investments include a planned $3.3 billion to be spent in cloud computing and AI infrastructure between now and the end of 2026. Microsoft has stated that it expects to bring 2,300 construction jobs to the area by 2025 and 2,000 permanent jobs over time. These developments highlights the strength and the potential of our local economy and underscores the need for the investments in our capital plan. During the second quarter, we continued to move forward on major projects in our capital plan. It's the largest five-year investment plan in our history totaling $23.7 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low-risk and highly executable. At the end of May, we closed on our second option at West Riverside Energy Center for $100 million. This adds a 100 megawatts of efficient combined-cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. You'll recall that last year, we discussed several filings or last quarter we discussed several filings for major projects to support economic growth and reliability in Wisconsin. This includes approximately 1,200 megawatts of efficient natural gas generation at our Paris and Oak Creek sites as well as 2 billion cubic foot liquefied natural gas storage facility and a 33 mile gas lateral to serve the Oak Creek site. In total, these projects combined represent $2.1 billion of investment. Our proposals were submitted to the Wisconsin Commission in April and we expect a decision in approximately a year. Also under review, we filed an application in February to purchase a 90% ownership interest in High Noon Solar Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin. With an expected investment of approximately $580 million, the facility is expected to provide 300 megawatts of solar generation. We have asked the commission to make a decision before the end-of-the year. As a reminder, we expect these investments to earn AFUDC during the construction period after commission approval. And in our WEC Infrastructure segment, the Delilah I solar project is now expected to go into service at the end-of-the year, delayed from June due to a weather event. We plan to invest approximately $460 million for a 90% ownership interest in this project in Northeast Texas. And we still expect our Maple Flats solar project to be in service by the end-of-the year. As you recall, we're investing an additional $560 million this year in our Infrastructure segment. We reallocated away from our operations in Illinois a total of $800 million in our five-year capital plan. Overall, our plan fully supports our long-term earnings growth rate, which we project to be in the 6.5% to 7% range on a compound average annual basis. We're also on schedule with the development of our next five-year plan. And as usual, we expect to share the details with you in the fall. Now I have a few updates on the regulatory front. In Wisconsin, we filed new rate reviews for test year 2025 and 2026 on April 12th. Our request focused on addressing three major areas of need. First, improving reliability and reducing outages from increased storm activity. Second, supporting Wisconsin's economic growth and job creation through investments in new-generation and distribution projects. And lastly, continue the transition from coal generation to renewables and natural gas. Commission staff and intervenor testimony is scheduled for August 21st, we expect a decision by the end-of-the year with new rates effective January 1st, 2025. We have smaller rate reviews and progress at Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources. We also expect decisions on these reviews by the end of the year. And in Illinois, we've been engaged in three dockets. The Illinois Commerce Commission issued its decision on the first of these, a limited rehearing on the commission's rate order for Peoples Gas at the end of May. The commission had agreed to reconsider our request to restore $145 million for safety modernization program in 2024. This mostly related to emergency work, unfinished projects and work driven by public entities like the City of Chicago. The commission granted $28.5 billion concentrating on what they deemed emergency work. We have appealed this decision to the Illinois Appellate Court along with other items in the rate order, including the commission's previous disallowance of investments in new service centers. We are also actively involved in two remaining dockets. One is the review of the safety monetization program. Staff and intervener rebuttal testimony are expected by August 21st with a commission decision expected in the first quarter of 2025. The other docket is the evaluation of the future of natural gas in Illinois, which is expected to conclude in about a year. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments. Across our business, we continue to make good progress towards our goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In May, we retired units five and six at our Oak Creek power plant. Together, those made up over 500 megawatts of coal-fired generation. Including these units since 2018, we've retired nearly 2,500 megawatts of older fossil fuel generation. Finally, a quick reminder about the dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're tracking in that range now and expect the dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth of our earnings per share. Now, I'll turn it to Xia to provide you more details on our financial results and our guidance for the third quarter. Xia Liu : Thank you, Scott. We earned $0.67 a share for the second quarter. While this was a decrease of $0.25 quarter-over-quarter, we exceeded our Q4 guidance -- Q2 guidance range of $0.60 to $0.64 per share, driven by favorable O&M and financing compared to guidance. As Scott indicated, we're on-track to meet our 2024 earnings guidance. As I reminded you on the last couple of calls, with the redesign changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are now more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters when natural gas usage is the highest. This earnings shift has impacted our second quarter and will impact our Q3 guidance, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Now, let's look at our quarter-over-quarter variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, earnings were $0.19 lower compared to the second quarter of 2023 as a result of higher O&M, fuel, depreciation and amortization, interest and other expenses. A couple of drivers for the day-to-day O&M variance are worth noting. One, we experienced higher storm costs in the current quarter compared to Q2 last year. And two, we benefited in Q2 last year from a land sale at a retired plant site in Wisconsin. Looking ahead, I now expect overall day-to-day O&M in 2024 to be 2% to 3% higher compared to 2023. This is a 4% improvement compared to our initial expectation due to our continued O&M savings initiatives that we expect to realize late this year. The impact of weather was flat for the quarter. Compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.02 negative impact for the second quarter in both 2023 and 2024. Our weather normal electric sales in Wisconsin are relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and are overall in line with our forecast. Looking at ATC, continued capital investment contributed an incremental penny to Q2 earnings compared to 2023. And in our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings improved $0.02 in the second quarter of '24 compared to the second quarter of '23, driven partially by higher production tax credit at WEC Infrastructure. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.09 as a result of the impact of tax timing and higher interest expense. Now turning to guidance, for the third quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.68 to $0.70 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, it also accounts for the shift in Illinois revenue recognition pattern. Our third quarter 2023 earnings were $1 a share. Once again, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. Before I turn back to Scott, let me quickly remind you that we continue to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans to issue common equity. Also, as we said before, we plan to set up an ATM program. Overall, we still project that our common equity issuance will be up to $200 million for 2024. Post 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital spending ratably with approximately $500 million expected per year in the current plan. We look forward to updating you in the fall as we refresh our capital and financing plans. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Xia. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hi guys, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, good afternoon, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Hi, Scott. Just -- starting off just on sort of the perennial Microsoft opportunity that always seems to be asked. It's obviously becoming even more kind of topical now. Just remind us on what portion of Microsoft's land acquisition and build is kind of layered in your current plan? And the reason why I ask is that it's obviously now kind of public that they bought a bit more land. And I guess, when do you see this hit your plan more materially? Thanks. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Shar. So just as everyone -- update everyone, they announced spending $3.3 billion through 2024 through 2026, which is on that first about 315 acres that they purchased. And then last fall, they purchased another 1,030 acres. And, of course, we pulled our capital plans together before that 1,000 acres were purchased. And then just this morning, there's been a couple announcements in the paper where they purchased another 173 acres in Southeastern Wisconsin. So we are currently in the process of working with Microsoft and developing our plans for our next five-year plan that we'll roll out this fall in the development. But currently, we really only have the energy and the capacity needs for that first 315 acres. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay, that's perfect. So more to come there. And then just lastly on the Delilah I solar project delay, it's roughly six months. I guess, can you just -- maybe a question for Xia is how to think about the offsets around the potential headwind there versus your kind of prior assumption? Thanks. Xia Liu : Yes. We took that into consideration as we reaffirmed the annual guidance of $4.80 to $4.90. So as I mentioned, we continue to focus on O&M management and financing costs and tax and others. So we're confident that we can offset the downside from the delay. Shar Pourreza : Okay. That's perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. And hopefully Gale is somewhere tropical listening to this earnings call. Thanks. Appreciate it. Scott Lauber : He probably is. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good afternoon, team. Can you guys hear me okay? Scott Lauber : Yes, we can hear you fine. Welcome back, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate the time, guys. It's a pleasure to chat here. So perhaps just to kick things off here, look, nicely done all-around. In fact, I wanted to just focus on the infrastructure segment. Obviously, you guys are planning well against those targets. I'm curious as you think about the totality of the data center opportunities, what does that mean as you think about the opportunities that you're seeing on that side of the business? And how do you think about the scope of that business in turn? You guys are obviously focused on contracted opportunities. By contrast, a lot of these potential customers would be in a similar manner focused on these kinds of counterparties. Curious as you think about that opportunity set on that front first. Scott Lauber : Sure. And we've been working with Microsoft on the needs for the area and Wisconsin has got a lot of development opportunities and we want to make sure we hit the capacity requirements we need for the area to support the growth, not just Microsoft, but all the other growth that we're seeing in the region. So that's why we've added the -- and you'll see more filings shortly on renewable projects in the next month or so that we're proposing to help beat the capacity and the energy needs in the region. So we think there's a lot of opportunity not only from generation of renewables, some capacity needs, some distribution needs also, but also American Transmission Company and investment in the transmission in the region. So we're factoring all that in as we pull together our five-year plan here. Xia Liu : And Julien, all those filings will be in the regulated area, as you know, in Wisconsin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Indeed. I know you're pursuing this on multiple fronts. Absolutely. And then team, just maybe to tackle on the regulatory front, a couple of questions here. How do you think about this -- the PSC's denial in the AFUDC? Is there anything to read into that here on the pre-construction costs? And just -- I know it's a little bit nit-picky, but I'm just curious if there's anything to tease out of that in terms of direction, strategically or financial? Scott Lauber : No, I don't think there's anything to read into that. We, of course, thought if we get approval on that, we'll wait and see what the final written order is. But when you look at the value we're providing our customers getting these orders in early, both from a cost-savings standpoint and a time of delivery standpoint, there's really a lot of value for our customers. So we're going to most likely ask for reconsideration and refile that information with the additional information they're looking for. So stay tuned on that, but we think there's a lot of value. And I know the cost of the projects as the longer you wait would continue to go up as everyone across the country is looking at adding generation. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, that seems pretty transparent as you say. And lastly, I'll just offer this. I traded in the dog, the equity, traded him in and I got a little boy now. So I appreciate you guys looking for it all along. Scott Lauber : Congratulations. Excellent to hear. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Absolutely. All right, guys. I'll see you soon, alright? Appreciate it. Scott Lauber : It sounds good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Good afternoon, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hi, Scott. Just as we look forward to your kind of usual plan refresh with Q3 and CapEx has usually been biased higher, how should we think about incremental equity needs associated with that? Should it just be any incremental CapEx is financed consistent with your utility capital structures or any different way to think about it? Scott Lauber : No, I think you got it right in line. I mean, of course, we'll put everything together and look at it, refresh it again, but similar to what Xia has been talking about, we'll just look at the equity needs in-line with the capital spend and be very excited about the long-term growth that we have available on the capital and the insights we have looking-forward on additional capital. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That makes sense. And then shifting over to Illinois, I was just maybe hoping you could frame some bookends for potential outcomes of the still pending docket, namely the pipe program review. What's the range of outcomes there? And then also really, is there anything -- any loose end still tied to like the QIP Rider reconciliations from prior years that could move numbers around at all? Scott Lauber : Sure. So let's look at both of them. So the QIP Rider is from other years. Right now, 2016 Rider has been queued up I think for a decision hopefully I would expect by the end-of-the year. Decision will be made in that. As you know, it's 2016 Rider, so it's been a while. And then, of course, we have those other years under the QIP still to look at. So remember the requirements there is prudency and we think we've been very prudent specifically after the Integrys acquisition where we really took a look at the program and factored in a lot of information that we received from the audits of the Liberty Audit and staff recommendations from that audit. So those are still more to come on there. And then under the current S&P, remember, the S&P in our last rate case, no one requested a pause in the program at all during the rate case. And now in looking at the testimony for the first set of testimony that came through, there is no one also recommending a pause in the case. The range that our people are talking about that was in the testimony is from including emergency work to working with the City of Chicago and emergency work. There, the City of Chicago, I think he said he should lift the pause for at least two years with a cap of about $245 million all the way to the other extreme where I think staff recommending that you accelerate the program and actually get it done faster by 2030. So there's quite a range in the middle there. But once again, none of the interveners in the initial testimony, they all said they should lift the pause and get some work done specifically related to the emergency work and working with the City of Chicago as they do their capital work. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Yes, just on that, I mean, I think as we've seen with some of the recent orders there, the ICC has come out worse than every single other intervener. So how do we just think about that risk in these dockets that you could get more of the same when it actually comes down to the final order? Scott Lauber : Yes. And we're going to have to wait-and-see and see what they say. I think when you look at it from every intervener group though, they are saying we need to work with the City of Chicago, including the City of Chicago to help them with their capital programs and everyone even there on the rehearing talked about the emergency work. So on that low end, you're talking between $60 million and $100 million a year. So I don't think anyone is disputing that. And I understand what the commission is, but they're taking some time. And I think when you look at that last S&P case or the rehearing we asked for, they are concentrating on purely emergency and wanted to wait for this order to look at the entire program. So I wish I knew the answer, but that's why we're going to the case. Michael Sullivan : Okay. No, that is super helpful context. Thank you. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hi, good afternoon, Scott and Xia. Thanks for giving me time. Hi, just on the safety modernization program review in Illinois. So obviously, you had a decision on the $145 million, you got $28 million. Can you just remind us what is baked into the plan '25 and forward on that -- on the safety program? Scott Lauber : Sure, and I'll let Xia go through the details. But in general, we took about $800 million out. And as we look at our plan, we'll reevaluate it based on the testimony we're seeing here as we look at the next five-year plan. But Xia, can you tell us what's in the current? Xia Liu : Yes, it's between $100 million to $120 million a year, Durgesh. And as Scott mentioned, we are in the process of refreshing the capital plan. So we're working with the team in Illinois to reflect the latest development from the commission's decision on the approval of the $28.5 million. So likely that number could potentially come down over the next five years, but we're still working through the details right now. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And just to be clear, first quarter of next year, we're going to get a decision on the spending relative to what you have in the plan, right? I'm assuming you've asked for anywhere between $100 million to $120 million and then the commission is going to come back with a recommendation. Is that fair? Scott Lauber : Yes. We expect to hear a recommendation in the first quarter of 2025 from the commission. Durgesh Chopra : Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then just can I quickly follow up on Delilah I? Any color you can share? I know you mentioned weather event. I'm just wondering if it's -- it could be more than six months? Just what caused it? Was it just equipment or something else? Any color you can share there? Thank you. Scott Lauber : Yes, sure. There was -- and remember, we haven't purchased it yet. We have a commitment to, but it was during construction and there was a hail event there. So there was some hail damage. We want to work with the developer as they are repairing it to make sure the fields in full shape before we purchase it. We anticipate based on all the latest discussions that it will be in by the end-of-the year. And we get weekly updates on the progress going there. And right now that is still the plan to be in by the end-of-the year assuming no other events happen. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Xia. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Carly Davenport : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott Lauber : Hi, Carly. Absolutely. Carly Davenport : Just wanted to ask a quick one on transmission and ATC. We've obviously seen the sizing of MISO Tranche 2 moving higher here. So just curious how you're thinking about the opportunities around transmission there both from a size and a timing perspective. Scott Lauber : Sure. I think Tranche 2 from everything I've seen and heard is going to be larger than Tranche 1 and you've talked about that. I think it will be probably about proportionately larger for ATC. So a lot of good opportunities there, but that spending probably won't actually occur to like 2030 plus, right, because they're still working through Tranche 1. I think the other big driver for American transmission company is going to be the economic development in the region and putting in renewables in the system. So last year, Tranche 1 had an effect on our capital plan, but the biggest drivers were economic development and continuing renewables in Wisconsin. So I consider both of those to be additional drivers. And remember that Tranche 1 was in 2020. So as they go through and reprice all of that, when you think about inflation in the last several years, it's going to be -- it's going to most likely be bigger than the original amount. Carly Davenport : Great. I appreciate that color. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Our next caller comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Scott Lauber : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hi, everybody. Hi. First question on Illinois. Just a question of timing. So you mentioned the uncertainty will last for about a year. At what point might you start to consider reallocating capital into this state? Could we see some CapEx go back into Illinois with the update in three months or would it be unlikely to show up until the fee update in the fall of 2025 when all of those dockets are wrapped up? Scott Lauber : Well -- and we'll look at it. When you think about Illinois, we'll know more on the S&P program in the first quarter of next year. There's also a -- there's the future of natural gas that's being looked at and there's also an IRP process where we get stakeholders involved and our first filing will be in 2025. So, as you know, as we pull our capital plans together in the fall of this year, we're going to be pretty conservative as we look at that until we have a little more clarity. And when we think about it, there's just a lot of opportunities outside of Illinois for the additional capital and growth. Andrew Weisel : That makes sense. Next question for Xia. If I heard you right on the O&M, you're now projecting it to be up 2% to 3%. Last quarter, you said up 3% to 5%, originally it was up 6% to 7%. So this is really good progress. Can you just give us a little bit of detail on those moving parts? How is it that the outlook is getting better and better? What are some examples? Xia Liu : Oh, there -- every manager in the business unit understands that we had a very mild first quarter. So we made it very clear that we need to be highly focused on O&M to offset the weather headwind in the first quarter. Benefits are lower, expected to be lower. We're also looking at all the angles about using contractors versus internal labor and we -- it's across-the-board, I would say, so... Andrew Weisel : Okay. Relative to the original budgets, would you call most of these savings one time then or is some of it going to be sustainable? Xia Liu : I think it's a combination of one-time initiatives, but also continued focus on driving efficiency across-the-board which is also sustainable. It's a combination of both. Scott Lauber : And also when you think about it, having a warm first quarter, you don't have like the number of leaks as you would in the gas system. So some things are naturally less now. So we've got a little bit less O&M in the gas system and we had some significant storms. So between the storms and the warmer weather, we've asked everyone across the business unit to really control cost and really kind of do some one-time things here. On the other hand, we are making sure we are actively responding to storms because the storms have had bigger and actually continuing to work on our forestry program because of some of the damage some of the storms have had to the system. So we want to really balance customer reliability along with our savings? Andrew Weisel : Got it. That's very helpful. Then just one very nit-picky one. Corporate and other minus $0.06 for taxes this quarter, I think it was plus $0.09 in the first quarter. Will you just remind us what's the expectation for the full-year? Should that net up to zero or something else? Xia Liu : It would be slightly positive. If you think about the reason why we had a large timing -- tax timing in the first quarter and the opposite in the second quarter. Part of that is driven by the earnings pattern shift in Illinois, so tax dollars follow the earnings pattern. And two, we had a deferral -- I'm sorry, the delay of the Delilah. So part of that is reflected in the second quarter. But as we put Delilah online end-of-the year, we expect the tax dollars to follow. Andrew Weisel : Okay, very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Neil Kalton : Yes, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Two questions. Just on the Microsoft opportunity, a lot of acreage here. As we think about the CapEx refreshes going-forward, at what point in time do you think you'll have clarity to start flowing some of that potential spend related to incremental opportunities into the plan? Is that like potentially '24 we could see some or is this more like '25 or '26? Scott Lauber : Sure. And actually, thanks, Neil and thanks for the question. So we're actually -- between us and American transmission company, we're actually spending some money now on some of the substations and we have those orders in for some of the generation and it's to support the economic development across-the-board. So it's going to be '24, '25 and then even more in '26 as we get those orders released at the commission and approval for that generation. We're also -- in the next month or so, you'll see some filing on additional renewables that support the generation needs as we continue to add renewables to our portfolio. So that spending, it will be probably in that '26, '27 timeframe. Neil Kalton : Okay. So it's kind of like broadly overall, it's not just tied to the Microsoft thing, sort of overall you have this need and kind of anticipate things happening that we start to kind of flow it in over time. And as we get more clarity, more comes in, is that right? Scott Lauber : Exactly, exactly. And remember, the growth that they provided us is really only through their capital plans through '26. I imagine once they get it in, they'll continue to ramp up. But we'll continue to work through it. And I think our plan is extremely long as we start adding 2029 to our five-year plan. Neil Kalton : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I just wanted to come back up to Wisconsin if I could with the recent commission vote here. Just wondering with the split vote, what you take from that, I guess, any thoughts on the direction of the commission at this point? Scott Lauber : No, I think it's kind of early to tell. I think they were just looking for some additional information and I don't think they had the full information on and they mentioned on the economics and the benefits of this. So this is maybe a communication between our staff and their staff and we just got to understand it. So we'll get the order, we'll review it. We'll pull the information together and ask for a reconsideration. I'm not overly concerned on this. And in the end, when you listen to their comments, if they didn't have all the information, you know they have to make the right decision for what they think is right too. So I appreciate them really evaluating each case. So I won't over -- read into this over too much. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my follow up. Scott, I know we're getting closer to the back-half of the year. Just on Point Beach PPA, I know you've talked about sort of this coming potentially too ahead as we're getting to the year-end. I guess how are sort of conversations going with NextEra and a new PPA or sort of another path forward there? Any updates? Scott Lauber : Yes, it's really -- we've had really good productive conversations with NextEra, but really nothing to report at this time. So still in discussions, but stay-tuned to this. And we'll -- we're working on it. Shar Pourreza : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks so much guys for taking my follow up. Appreciate it. Scott Lauber : Absolutely. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Hi. Scott Lauber : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson : Good afternoon. How are you doing? So just one question at this point and that is the Illinois Gas Appeal at the Appellate Court in Illinois, just any frame of timing when you think you might get a resolution to that? Scott Lauber : I apologize. It didn't come too clear on -- the future of gas? Paul Patterson : No, no. So you guys appealed the order to the Illinois field court. And I was just wondering when you think a decision from that might be happening? Scott Lauber : I anticipate it's going to take a year or two. Paul Patterson : Okay. A long-time. Okay. Thank you. That's it from me. Scott Lauber : All right. Thank you. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for participating. If you have any questions, feel free as always to call Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Thank you.",

And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Scott Lauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Scott Lauber : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2024. Here with me are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. This excludes a charge of $0.06 per share related to the disallowance of certain 2016 capital expenditures under the Qualifying Infrastructure Plant rider in Illinois. With this solid quarter, we remain on track for a strong 2024. Our focus on executing the fundamentals of our business is creating real value for our customers and stockholders. Today we're reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. On an adjusted basis the range is $4.80 to $4.90 a share. Of course, this assumes normal weather through the remainder of 2024. We continue to see strong foundation of growth in the region. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 2.9%, continuing a long-running trend below the national average. Microsoft is making good progress on its large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin. The company has continued to increase its landholdings as part of this development. It has been reported that Microsoft now owns more than 1,900 acres, up from 1,300 acres at the beginning of the year and work is well underway. We're seeing development elsewhere in the state as well. Amazon for example, opened a 1.1 million square foot warehouse in Kenosha earlier this year. The company is growing steadily with additional distribution facilities and is also starting to use electric delivery vans in its fleet. And in Green Bay, Georgia-Pacific completed a major mill expansion just last month, with an investment of $550 million. Of course, this growth is spawning small commercial and residential development throughout the region. This highlights the strength and the potential of our local economy and underscores the need for the investments in our updated capital plan. And speaking of capital plan, we're very excited to roll out the plan for the period 2025 through 2029. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $28 billion over the next five years. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $4.3 billion above our previous five-year plan. That's more than an 18% increase. Once again, a major factor in our plan is the economic growth we're seeing in Southeastern Wisconsin, particularly in what we call the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and the Illinois State line. This plan supports 1,800 megawatts of additional demand over the next five years. That's an incremental 400 megawatts from our previous plan. In our new 5-year plan, we expect our asset-based growth to an average rate of 8.8% a year. This supports our long-term projected earnings per share growth of 6.5% to 7% a year on a compound annual basis. As I mentioned, we increased our capital plan by $4.3 billion, driven by an increase in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution and partially offset by a reduction in energy infrastructure. Let me give you a few updates on the details. Over the next five years, we'll continue to transform our power generation fleet to support economic growth, reliability and compliance with the EPA rules by investing in renewables and natural gas generation. Between 2025 and 2029, we plan to increase our investment in regulated renewables by $2.1 billion over our prior plan. In total, we plan to invest $9.1 billion in 2,900 megawatts of solar, 900 megawatts of wind and almost 600 megawatts of battery storage. That adds up to 4,400 megawatts more than quadrupling our carbon-free generation from where we are today. These resources save on fuel cost and provide benefits to customers through tax credits. To support economic growth and system reliability when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and on those extreme weather days, we need dispatchable resources. We expect to spend an incremental $900 million on modern efficient natural gas generation over the next five years versus the prior plan. This includes both combustion turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines or RICE units. Also we plan to invest an additional $400 million in liquefied natural gas capacity for another two Bcf facility. This will be used to meet customer demand for heating and ensure gas supply for our power generation. In addition, American Transmission Company will be adding transmission capabilities to serve the region's robust economic growth, connecting new renewables and strengthening of the system. Our plan calls for us to invest $3.2 billion in that effort between 2025 and 2029. This represents a $200 million increase from the previous plan. And to help ensure reliability and support economic growth, we're continuing to invest in our distribution networks with an additional $700 million in the plan. Given the significant investment opportunity in our regulated businesses, we have reduced our planned investments in our infrastructure segment by $800 million compared to the last plan. This leaves us approximately $400 million in the plan for next year. And today, I'm pleased to announce our plan to acquire a 90% interest in Hardin Solar III Energy Park located in Ohio. We expect to invest approximately $410 million to add 250 megawatts of renewable energy to our infrastructure portfolio when the projects come online, currently expected in the first quarter of 2025. Our future is bright, investment opportunity has never been stronger and we're focused on execution. We look forward to providing more detail on our plan in just a few weeks at the EEI conference. Turning to the regulatory front, I have a few updates across our service areas. In Wisconsin, rate reviews are nearly complete for test years 2025 and 2026. All testimony and hearings are concluded in the case and we expect the decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025. As you know, in Michigan, the Public Service Commission has now approved the settlement in the 2025 rate cases for both Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources, each with an ROE of 9.86%. And in Illinois, we're actively engaged in two dockets. One is the review of the Safety Modernization Program. The next steps are an ALJ proposed order at the end of November, final briefings to the ICC in December and the commission's final decision expected in the first quarter of 2025. The other docket is an evaluation of the future of natural gas in Illinois, which was initially planned to conclude next year. The ICC has extended this docket into 2026. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments. Now, I'll turn it to Xia to provide you with more details on our financial results and our financing plans. Xia Liu : Thank you, Scott. Turning now to earnings. Our third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings were $0.82 per share. This excludes the $0.06 per share charge related to the disallowance of certain 2016 capital expenditures under the QIP rider in Illinois. While this was a decrease of $0.18 per share quarter-over-quarter, we did exceed our Q3 guidance range, driven by more favorable September weather, financing and timing of tax items compared to the guidance. As Scott indicated, we remain on track to meet our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance. Now let's look at our quarter-over-quarter variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison of adjusted third quarter results on Page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2024 were $0.18 lower when compared to 2023. This decrease was driven by the Illinois rate design change, higher O&M, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. These items more than offset favorable weather, timing of fuel expense, taxes and other items. Specifically on weather, compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.02 positive impact in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a $0.01 positive impact in 2023. Also, as I reminded you on the last few calls, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are now more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters when natural gas usage is the highest. This shift resulted in lower third quarter earnings when compared to the prior year. Before I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather-normal electric sales for the quarter. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were up four-tenth of 1% quarter-over-quarter. Sales from residential and small C&I segments, both slightly increased compared to Q3 last year. Overall, year-to-date, retail electric volumes are in line with our forecast. Looking at ATC, continued capital investment contributed an incremental $0.01 to Q3 earnings compared to 2023. Remember, we have been recognizing earnings at 10.38% ROE. I'll discuss in a few minutes that we have some tailwinds in Q4 related to FERC's recent decision of 10.48% ROE. And in our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings improved to $0.06 in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily driven by production tax credits resulting from higher PTC rates approved by the IRS in the third quarter as well as a quarter-over-quarter increase in production from our renewable generation facilities. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.07 as a result of the impact of tax timing and higher interest expense. As Scott noted, we are reaffirming our 2024 annual guidance on an adjusted basis. That range is $4.80 to $4.90 per share. This includes October weather and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Year-to-date compared to last year, we are $0.07 behind, largely due to weather. However, looking ahead, we have some tailwinds in Q4 this year. This will help us to achieve our adjusted earnings guidance. For example, as I mentioned just now, we have been recognizing earnings at ATC assuming a 10.38% ROE. With FERC's decision on the 10.48%, we will be able to unwind a reserve at ATC in Q4 to reflect this change. This item is about $0.05 a share that we have included in our guidance. And recall, weather was $0.07 unfavorable in Q4 last year. Assuming normal weather for the remainder of this year, it also should be a tailwind. Overall, we remain on track to meet our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance. Now turning to our financing plan. For 2024 we continue to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans to issue common equity. Also, we have now formally put in place an ATM program which we plan to tap into during this quarter. Overall, we still project that our common equity issuance will be up to $200 million for 2024. Beyond 2024, Scott has outlined our new five-year capital plan. I'll spend few minutes discussing our anticipated financing plan. You can find this information on page 22 of the earnings package. As you can see on the chart over the next five years we expect cash from operations to fund $18.5 billion to $19.5 billion or about 60% of our cash needs. About $9.5 billion to $10 billion or 31% of the funding is expected to come from incremental debt. This could include some junior subordinated notes or other instruments with equity content. And the remaining 9% of cash is expected to be funded by common equity. This range is between $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. As I said previously, the cadence of common equity is a function of capital. Given the strong capital plan in 2025, we expect common equity to be between $700 million to $800 million. All-in-all compared to the prior five-year plan we expect about 50% of the $4.3 billion additional capital to be financed with increased equity content. Finally, as shown on page 21 of the earnings package, through our capital allocation we expect the percent of asset base in our regulated electric businesses to grow faster over the next five years. This is driven by the strong economic development and demand growth in Wisconsin and our continued energy transition plans. At the same time, the percent of asset base in gas distribution and contracted renewables is expected to decline. Particularly, you can see that we expect our asset base in Illinois to decline from 16% in 2023 to 10% in 2029 with only 9% at Peoples Gas. In closing, we are excited about our company's future and investment opportunities ahead of us. With that I'll turn it back to Scott. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Xia. Finally, a quick reminder about the dividend. I expect we'll provide our 2025 dividend plan and earnings guidance in December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're positioned well within the range so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth of the earnings per share. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Now we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, Scott. Hey, Xia. Scott Lauber : How are you doing? Shar Pourreza : All right. Not too bad. Let me just -- I know this is kind of a repeated question from me but I have to ask just given the size in your kind of resource mix want to just touch on Point Beach for a sec. I mean obviously many of the infrastructure segment PPAs roll off around the time of the Point Beach PPA. Are those kind of viable alternatives? If you can't get there with NextEra, would you look to backstop them with dispatchable capacity so some incremental spend there? Just directionally how is that bid-ask progressing? Scott Lauber : Sure. And as just a reminder for everyone our PPA with Point Beach and I think the one contract ends at December of 2030 the other is March of 2033. And like we talked about we have been in very constructive discussions on the Point Beach with NextEra. We're making good progress on both sides. We've been really busy up here with Wisconsin rate case. I think they've been busy down there with some hurricane activity. So we're making good progress more to come. I expect you'll see more in the next six months. But lining up really well we think for everybody. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously Scott very healthy CapEx update. I just -- I'm not getting a strong sense on why we saw sort of that CapEx reduction on the infrastructure side. I think it's been some time there's been some sort of a deemphasis of that segment. I just want to get a better sense on what's driving it. Is it sort of a capital allocation return issue? Is the kind of the demand for contracted renewable slowed? I guess what exactly is going on in that segment? Should we kind of start tempering our expectations there? Scott Lauber : No. I mean what we looked at it last year when we went through the plan we had actually reduced that segment also just because of the amount of economic development. And then as what happened in Illinois and we reduced our capital plan there we said we're going to spend about $800 million incremental. And the last contract we announced here hits our investment profiles and it fills that amount of the $800 million we said we're going to do. We just have a lot of capital within the regulated utility with the economic development going on in Wisconsin and we just want to concentrate on that. The economics have been good on the other -- in the infrastructure segment it's just we've got a lot to deploy here in Wisconsin so we're going to concentrate on that. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. That is perfect. We'll see you in a week in Florida and congrats on getting warmer. Appreciate It. Scott Lauber : Absolutely, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. How you guys doing? Scott Laube : Good. How you doing, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just talking about Illinois a little bit more here. I mean on PGL here a few different options that have been put on the table here and there's a staff rack out there how do you think about that Option 3? I suppose about $7 billion-ish through 2040. How does that compare with what you guys are updating here today? And is there any upside vis-a-vis what you guys are embedding against that proposed outcome here? I'll let you guys comment. Scott Lauber : Sure. That's a good question. And Option 3 just to get everyone on the same page Option three has the spending and it's the option -- it's the lowest spending option. It's the preferred option by PGL. And then staff also came out ICC staff came out and recommended Option three also that has about $7.2 billion of spending over the period. When you look at what we put together in the five-year plan and Xia and I don't like to have much any white space if any in our 5-year plan; so we took the capital down just to the emergency work and the work needed for facility relocates. So that's about $90 million a year in our plan for the next five years. So if this plan would get picked up I think that could be an upside of maybe $100 million to $150 million maybe $200 million a year. But remember if they would pick that we ramp down those projects very quickly of what we are doing. So it takes a while to ramp back up. But we took basically just the bare minimum and put it in our current 5-year plan. So there would be upside if one of these options is selected. Operator : Your next question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Go ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just wanted to ask for a little more color on the Wisconsin case that you have pending and maybe why you weren't able to settle there. What some of the sticking points might be? And how you're feeling about the final order coming up? Scott Lauber : Sure, sure. So we are extremely far in the Wisconsin case. When you think about the Wisconsin case we've gone through all the hearings. In fact the final decision matrix just came out the other day. So we're about as far along in the Wisconsin case that we've ever been this time of the year. So right now the next step is the commission making a decision which they usually do. Historically, it's been the first week in December -- the first or second week in December but they're far along and they've got everything ready for a decision. Now the idea of a settlement -- and we've talked a little bit about settlement. We're very happy where the staff position came out. I think everyone still related to 2 years ago on the settlement that we had in Wisconsin, I think everyone wants to just see the commission go through a case. I'm very comfortable with the commission going through a case and deciding going through the decision matrix. So we just weren't able to come up to a settlement, but I'm not concerned about that. I think overall, our commission is filled with really balanced individuals that understand the importance of reliability and the economic development in the region. So we're ready for a decision. We just don't get there in the settlement, but that's not all bad either. I think everyone wants to see what's going on here. Okay. Does that answer your question? Michael Sullivan : Yes, it does. Yes, very helpful, Scott. And then I just had two questions just on the earnings side. On this ATC ROE that you're going to book in Q4, I guess how should we think about why you are not raising guidance for that? Or what would have happened if you weren't able to book that? Scott Lauber : No, that's a good question. And things move around in our forecast. And it came through there. We just got a little bit of timing of some other expenses that we were anticipating maybe would come through a little bit better. But timing, we got to make sure we execute on it. So factoring it all in, and we went through and factored everything through here and comfortable with keeping the guidance where it's at. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And then the last one Xia Liu : Michael, this is Xia. Just remember, we had a really mild first quarter. Year-to-date, we're $0.06 behind on weather. So like Scott said, there are lots of things that have kind of developed throughout the year, and this $0.05 will help us offset some of the weather deficit. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Appreciate that color. And then the last one for me, just to level set ahead of December here. So can you just remind what the base is for your long-term EPS CAGR? And will that shift with the December update? And how do we think about the potential to get back in that 6.5% to 7% range after kind of being short of that this year based on your guide? Scott Lauber : Sure. And our 6.5% to 7%, and we are still using the 2023 base. I think it was $4.60 as our starting point for our guidance because last year, because of the Illinois decision and some adjustments we had to do there and timing of when we could do our capital investments. So we're keeping that 2023 base this year as we look at our long-term guidance. We will -- we've got to get through the rate case here, and we'll come out with our plan next -- in December after we get through that. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Thank you very much. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Kalton from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Neil Kalton : Hi. Guys. How are you doing? Scott Lauber : Good. Hi, Neil. Neil Kalton : So a quick question, Scott. You opened up talking about the Microsoft that they acquired more land. I think you said 1,900 acres. Is that correct in total? Scott Lauber : Correct. Correct. So at the beginning of the year, they started about 1,300, and now they're up to 1,900 acres. Neil Kalton : Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of the CapEx refresh, I know you're kind of waiting on Microsoft to lay out additional plants, what they intend to do. Was there anything in this CapEx revision that sort of incorporated potential spend for what they might do to some extent? Or is that still all to be determined all on the come? Scott Lauber : So what this has in and what we talked about is 1,800 megawatts of capacity for the region over this 5-year period, which includes Microsoft, which includes getting some demand in from some electric vehicles and all the other economic development in the region. So that's 1,800 megawatts. Just to put that in perspective, our system is about 7,500 megawatts. So it's a little over 20% growth in capacity or demand needs in the region. So all of that is factored into our five-year plan. But just like many other companies, we are getting inquiries from a variety of other data centers. We just don't come out with a number until we really feel comfortable that it's actually going to happen. But if there would be any upside from any future stuff, that would probably be in those outer half of the plan. But based on the conversations, there's just a lot of good discussion on continued economic development in the region. Neil Kalton : Okay. Okay. Got it. And then I mean so just and maybe it's only limited as to what you can say. But like if Microsoft were to formally announce a Phase 2 would that be something that would necessitate more capacity? Scott Lauber : That -- we'd have to see what they're -- I mean Microsoft is -- we will let Microsoft make their announcements. Working with them on the demand, I'm not sure if that actually includes some other phases or not. They just -- we work with them on kind of the demand over the period and kind of keep it inside baseball here unfortunately. But that's the way they want to do it which is fine. Neil Kalton : Okay. Thank you very much. Scott Lauber : Thanks Neil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hey Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Just want to clarify a little on the CapEx update. Obviously some very big numbers here and I appreciate the granular detail on the moving pieces. One I wanted to clarify was electric generation. You showed that the total on Page 18 went up by $3.7 billion, but the commentary on Page 17 really only calls out $3 billion. You showed regulated renewables and the natural gas generation. We're missing about $700 million. So, what else is in that bucket? Then it looks like similar there's about a $100 million increase for natural gas distribution. Would I be correct? Is that just higher day-to-day spending and cost inflation? Or have you made some assumptions around regulation and policy changes in Illinois compared to the assumptions you made when you gave the last update in February? Scott Lauber : Yes. Good questions, really quick analysis of the numbers. So, when you look at the gas distribution and you go behind the numbers it's actually a decrease in Illinois and an increase in the other parts of the service territory Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota; as it relates to adding capital for good customer growth and just other area expansion. I think as you look at the PHMSA rules, there could be some requirements that more capital is needed. Until we see the final PHMSA rules, it's hard to really handicap the final number. So, that's really a plus in the other areas a little decline in Illinois. And in the generation, you're exactly right, there's probably about another $700 million. That's in a variety of projects across the enterprise from looking at upgrading a wind farm to get some additional production tax credits, to adding some more resilience and a few of our generating plants, to looking at other different types of backup storage just to make sure we have that additional resilience. So, it's a variety of items, all in that generation area just so we can make sure we continue to hit that demand. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Then on the transmission side you increased it by $200 million, is that all related to near-term economic development? Would I be correct in assuming that the MISO Tranche 2 stuff is more outside of this forecast period? Scott Lauber : Yes, you're exactly right. More of the MISO Tranche 2 is going to be after this most likely after this five-year plan, maybe a little bit at the very end, but most of it is going to be after the five-year plan. But we'll know more of that and the final numbers come December. Andrew Weisel : Very good. And one last one here on the load growth. I think you said you're now expecting 1,800 megawatts of incremental load, that's up from 1,400 megawatts. I don't think you commented on what that means in terms of percentage load growth forecast. Is that something that you can share now? Or is that something you plan to share at EEI? Scott Lauber : Sure. Sure, we can talk about them now. So, what -- when it looks at a megawatt hour basis and I think these are probably on the low side, but we extended that 4.5% to 5% electric sales growth through 2029. So, we continue to see the volumes on a megawatt-hour basis. And on a megawatt basis, we are at -- up 1,800 on a base of about 7,500. So, that's a little over a 20% increase in the demand on our sales, so very significant demand increase. And I really look at the demand as being a key component because that's really where we have to build the dispatchable resources too to make sure we have enough demand and capacity hit on those peak days. Make sense? Andrew Weisel : Yes, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Scott Lauber : Absolutely, Sophie. Sophie Karp : So, it's a great update all around, right? Your load growth is going higher. Very, very healthy capital update as well. Wisconsin rate case is, in it's going to last innings already. Is there any reason why I guess you wouldn't raise the EPS growth rate when you do refresh your guidance in December? Are there any like offsetting factors we are missing here that would prevent that from happening? Scott Lauber : That's a good question. And when we looked at it, we did -- we added capital in Wisconsin. We also reduced it in the WEC infrastructure but also looked at Illinois and reducing it. So as we look at it and add in the equity needs and the debt needs, we're very comfortable with that 6.5 to 7. We do have to get through the Wisconsin rate case and really hear what goes on in our Safety Modernization Program in Illinois, which we'll hear in the first quarter of next year. But it's really just being realistic on the financing plans, associated with our capital spending and taking down capital in some of the other areas. Sophie Karp : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Go for me [ph] we\u2019ll see you at the AI. Sophie Karp : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey team. Good afternoon. I got some Haribo gummy bears sitting outside my front door. That's my trick-or-treat. Scott Lauber : Excellent. Excellent. Thank you for supporting the community. Durgesh Chopra : Bingo. And they are from source from Milwaukee. Okay. So, a couple of questions, Xia. Just -- I know you talked about 50% the capital funded through equity. But when I compare plan -- the prior plan over the current plan, the CapEx has gone up $4.3 billion, but the equity has only gone up roughly $1 billion. It's gone up from like $2 billion and change to $3 billion at the midpoint of the current guidance range. So maybe just why is it -- I would have thought that the equity is a lot higher. Maybe just help us bridge the two planned equity issuance -- equity issuances between the two plans please? Xia Liu : Yes, I'd be happy to. So the last plan, remember the range was $1.95 billion to $2.35 billion. This plan the range is $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. So to your point, it's roughly about $800 million increase in common equity. We also are adding some holding company debt, particularly using maybe some hybrid that would give us 50% of the equity content. So if you include that, plus the $800 million of common equity, that's around $2 billion increase in equity content. So our capital has gone up $4.3 billion. We're adding a little over $2 billion of equity content including the $800 million of common equity. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. As always, that is crystal clear. Thank you, Xia. And then maybe just quickly I wanted to follow-up on Delilah solar. Is the plan that's still -- that it completes construction goes into service by the end of the year. Is that still on track? Scott Lauber : Yes. That is correct. Delilah and Maple Flats are both on track by the end of the year. Durgesh Chopra : All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate the time. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Good afternoon. Jeremy Tonet : Happy Halloween, everyone. Just wanted to go into the addition of gas generation, and how that contributes to LNG operations overall? Do you have any thoughts you could share there? Scott Lauber : Sure, sure. We're adding more gas generation. And as you can imagine, we want to make sure that we have that dispatchable gas -- our own gas within the state of Wisconsin to make sure we can run the generation and keep the houses warm on the gas side. So we added another 2 Bcf in our plan. Literally the one that we're looking at and we filed at the commission is sitting where a coal pile used to sit. So having that stored energy or stored fuel in the state of Wisconsin near the power plants are very helpful to make sure on those coldest days of the year that we have enough energy in the state to be able to run those plants. Couple of years ago we had one of our pipelines not our pipeline but one of our vendors suppliers pipeline had a compressor issue that really made the state of Wisconsin really thin on natural gas. So having those LNG tanks are going to be very critical to keep that reliability. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Very helpful there. And then going a bit further here with this big call on generation broadly in the country, I'm just wondering if you could provide us thoughts on reserve margins how it stands now where it could be going? And as it relates to gas generation, coal generation in particular does it affect retirement timelines given this greater need? And at the same time could CCS be part of the answer here? Just wondering if you have thoughts on these topics? Scott Lauber : Sure. And gas generation is critical for us as we look at having something dispatchable. I mean today is -- the wind's blowing. But some days the wind doesn't blow or the sun isn't shining. So we are looking at building our generation the mix renewables and gas generation and just to make sure we're staying ahead of the reserve margin that's needed for MISO and they've continued to evolve their rules as more renewables, appropriately as more renewables get on the system to make sure they have seasonal demand and the load following type of needs here and the capacity. So that is very important for us as we continue to grow out our capacity plans. What was your second part? Jeremy Tonet : Carbon capture with regards to gas generation and just coal plant retirements in general generation\u2026 Scott Lauber : In the carbon capture, for us we don't have any natural place to store the carbon here in Wisconsin. And if we had to do carbon capture, we think it would cost our customers $1 billion to $2 billion more in order to do carbon capture and haul it someplace that you look at where you're going to store it and then you have the transmission of it. So we, of course, looked at it, is it possible? It's just did not seem viable and cost-effective for our customers versus the plan that we're developing here and we laid out in front of you. And when you think about the coal retirements we already retired Oak Creek 5 and 6. The other units 7 and 8, we plan to retire at the end of 2025. And we're doing that because we're putting in some of the more efficient gas generation. And to be quite honest, if we weren't going to retire 7 and 8, we'd have to add additional capital to those plants to have them to extend longer and add the carbon capture. So those are still planning to be in retirements. Some of the plants like Weston 3, we plan on retiring by 2031. We continue to look does it make sense to use natural gas there or some other fuel? I don't know if it'd be economical or not. But it really hasn't adjusted much of our coal adjustments either, our coal plant retirements. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And just one last quick one if I could as far as 2025 funding needs are concerned for equity content, just wondering is it makes sense for the ATM? Could we see a block? How much transferability I guess is in the mix here? Scott Lauber : Sure. I'll let Xia take that one. Xia Liu : Yeah. So we have -- remember we still have the employee benefit plans on. So that will be part of the equity raise for next year. So the ATM should handle the remaining piece fairly easily. So we don't plan to have a block sale right now. The tax credits are already included in the FFO. So on average, we've been selling $100 million to $200 million so far. And as we continue to add renewable projects that number could grow a little bit, but those are already assumed in the FFO. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Your line is open. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, good morning or good afternoon rather. Long day. Thank you for taking my question. So just one for me. A lot of things have been answered. I guess just kind of decomposing that 8.8% asset-based growth figure, it does seem like a lot of the growth is coming from Wisconsin. So just what's rate base growth outlook in Wisconsin, as you see it today versus kind of what you've been kind of trending at or executing at the past few years? And that's it for me. Thanks. Scott Lauber : So when you look at the rate base growth in Wisconsin, it's going to be \u2013 oh, I don't know I imagine between 14% and 15%, pretty significant rate base growth. But remember, that's where all the economic growth is. And when you look at the economic growth and we usually look at the growth and try to break it into different components being \u2013 whether it's growth from sales, growth from resiliency. And a lot of our growth I would say, I don't know $8 billion to $9 billion that is related to economic development and growth of the support of the economy. So it's really driven that sales are going to help grow into that. So that's significant. And then ATC has good growth. So we're also growing a lot in the American Transmission Company, which is Wisconsin based also but FERC regulated. So a lot of growth in Wisconsin largely driven by economic development. Xia Liu : Yes. Nick 40% of our \u2013 this is Xia. 40% of our total capital is we call the growth capital. So that comes with the large customers paying for their required demand and related cost. So we feel good about the growth in Wisconsin and also the driver for it. Nicholas Campanella : All right. Thanks a lot. See you soon. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Hey, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Good afternoon. Paul Patterson : Just to follow things up. Is there any change \u2013 well, first of all, could you just sort of remind me what your what the rate increase outlook is given the new CapEx program, if it's changed at all and just what it is again? Scott Lauber : Sure. And we're right now going through the rate case in Wisconsin. So if you go out and you start to look at 2027 through 2030, you got to kind of break it into this capital. As Xia said a lot of it's being supported by economic development. So I think rate increases will be in line with inflation. We do have some reliability projects that we're putting in place that we're doing some overhead underground to add more stability as we continue to see some stronger weather patterns and wind patterns across the state. So that may take it maybe 1% above inflation. But for the most part, a lot of this capital is being driven by economic development which will come with megawatt hours and megawatt sales. So it's not like it's all on the back of our retail customers at any means. And Microsoft has said and they put in their testimony, they understand and they need to pay their fair share. They don't plan on subsidizing anyone else but they also realize that they're not supposed to get subsidized either. So they have been perfect. And as we look at potentially other data centers coming in that's kind of \u2013 that's the playbook to make sure everyone pays their fair share appropriate amount. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then on the \u2013 I apologize if I missed this, but it looked like there was a big increase in gas normalized sales in commercial or something for Q3, when I looked at your... Scott Lauber : And we can \u2013 when you look at Q3, commercial industrial yes, it was up a little bit. Q3 is such a small volume quarter that any little change can affect it. So I would not read much into it. I would look more at the year-to-date where we are. Q3 that could have been just an anomaly with the meter issue or something \u2013 I mean there's so smaller volumes in that quarter you got to really look at the year-to-date. Paul Patterson : Makes sense. Thanks so much. Have a great one. Scott Lauber : You too. Scott Lauber : All right. Thanks, everyone. That concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for participating. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Operator : Call has now ended. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. Before the conference call begins, please note that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. This call also will include non-GAAP financial information. The company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the materials posted on its website for this conference call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Scott Lauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Scott Lauber : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for calendar year 2024. Here with me are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2024 adjusted earnings of $4.88 a share. I am pleased to report that, we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure, from customer satisfaction, to financial performance, to steady execution of our capital plan. In just a few minutes, Xia will provide more details on our financial results, and outlook. For 2025 earnings, recall that in early December we provided our guidance in the range of $5.17 to $5.27 a share. We continue to target a 6.5% to 7% long-term, compound annual growth rate. We have a robust capital plan, driven by strong economic growth in our region. The Wisconsin unemployment rate stands at 3%, continuing a long running trend below the national average. And as we discussed, there have been many exciting developments along the I-94 corridor, between Milwaukee and Chicago. In December, less than a year after Eli Lilly acquired a facility in Pleasant Prairie, the pharmaceutical company announced plans for a $3 billion expansion. Eli Lilly predicts the expansion, will add 750 highly skilled jobs in addition to 2,000 construction jobs, to complete the project. Microsoft is making good progress on its large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin. Work continues on the first phase of the project. Microsoft took a short pause on construction, to evaluate the technical design of the second area. That pause was lifted and work has resumed. Microsoft is still reviewing designs, for the third area. Microsoft reports that the potential design changes, have not affected plans to invest $3.3 billion in the project by the end of 2026, and we do not anticipate these changes will impact our capital plan, or demand growth projections over the next five years. In fact, Microsoft purchased an additional 240 acres of land, just last week for another data center development. We're delighted that Microsoft continues to expand its commitment to the Milwaukee region. Also in January, Cloverleaf announced plans to develop approximately 1,700 acres in Port Washington, just North of Milwaukee, for another large data center campus. Cloverleaf projects that construction could start this fall. In the initial announcement, Cloverleaf expects the load to be one gigawatt. This development is very - in the very early stages, but all this load is incremental to our current plan. So we're off to a strong start to the year, with great economic prospects. To serve a growing economy, of course, we need to continue investing in our generation facility, and infrastructure. Our $28 billion five-year capital plan, which we updated October, is the largest in our history. A balanced generation mix is a significant focus, for our electric utilities. In the renewable area over the next five years, we have 4,300 megawatts planned for our expected investment of $9.1 billion. We wrapped up 2024 by bringing the Paris Solar Park into service, with an investment of approximately $319 million. It has added 180 megawatts of solar capacity for our Wisconsin utility customers. Next up on our schedule, we expect the 225 megawatt Darien Solar Park, to go into service later this year. Natural gas also continues to be a critical resource for reliable service. We expect the Wisconsin Commission, to make rulings on several major project filings throughout the year. That includes 1,200 megawatts of efficient natural gas generation, as well as 33-mile lateral and two Bcf of liquefied natural gas storage. Turning to our WEC infrastructure business, the Delilah I and Maple Flats solar project went online, at the end of last year. Between those two facilities, we invested approximately $890 million, or 90% ownership of 550 megawatts of capacity. And we expect to close, on the Hardin III project, during the first quarter. We plan to invest approximately $407 million for 90% ownership interest of the project, which has a total capacity of 250 megawatts. As a reminder, this project fulfills our five-year planned investment at WEC Infrastructure. Regarding transmission, as you saw in January, MISO announced capital investments on tranche 2.1. We expect ATC, to be assigned approximately $2 billion of that tranche, with an additional opportunity through the right of first refusal, or competitive bid of up to $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. As you know, we own 60% of ATC. Overall, we have a lot of confidence in our ability, to execute on our capital plan and continue our growth trajectory. Now, turning to the regulatory front, I am pleased to report that we currently have no planned, or active rate cases. As you know, the Wisconsin Commission finalized their written orders for test year 2025 and 2026. Consistent with prior disclosures, the Commission maintained a 53% financial equity layer, and a 9.8% return on equity for our Wisconsin Utilities. In Illinois, we remain actively engaged in two proceedings of note. One of these is evaluating the future of natural gas in Illinois. Currently, it's scheduled to extend into 2026. The other, a review of our safety modernization program, is close to its conclusion. We made our final oral arguments before the Commerce Commission, last week and expect a decision this quarter. Next up, Xia will provide you more details on our financials. Xia Liu : Thanks, Scott. Turning now to earnings, our 2024 adjusted earnings were $4.88 per share, an increase of $0.25 per share over 2023 adjusted earnings. In 2024, we experienced the warmest winter on record. The estimated weather headwind was $0.25 per share when compared to normal conditions. We were able to offset this by implementing a variety of initiatives such as O&M and fuel management, as well as tax and financing activities. This focus on execution was key for delivering our adjusted EPS near the top end of the earnings guidance. Now let's take a closer look at our year over year variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison, of adjusted full year results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operation, weather decreased earnings year-over-year by an estimated $0.05 per share. This weather impact, along with a total of $0.38 negative impact, related to increases in depreciation and amortization, day-to-day O&M and interest expense were more than offset by $0.49 of total positive variances from rate-based growth, fuel, tax and other. All in all, the utility operations grew $0.06 year-over-year. Now, before I discuss earnings comparison at the other segments, let me briefly comment on O&M and sales. Remember that originally we guided 2024 Total company day-to-day O&M, to be 6% to 7% higher compared to 23, largely driven by assets that were placed in service, and normal inflation. As you recall, several of the assets in WEC infrastructure, had a delayed in service until the end of the year. This in combination with initiatives we took, after the mild first quarter helped us achieve an overall increase of 2% over 2023 that, is considerably lower than the original guidance. Regarding our weather normal sales for 2024, as you can see on Pages 13 and 14 in our earnings packet, both retail electric and natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat year-over-year. For 2025, we're projecting weather normal retail electric sales in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine to grow 0.7%, and retail gas sales in Wisconsin excluding power generation to grow 1.9% from the 2024 level. Now back to our earnings comparison. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.07 compared to 2023. We recognized $0.05 in Q4, from the FERC order that resolved certain MISO, ROE complaints and set the ROE at 10.48%. The remaining $0.02 improvement in ATC earnings, was driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment grew $0.13 in 2024, compared to 2023. $0.03 were driven by additional investment in our power, the future plans and the remaining $0.10 related to WEC infrastructure. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segments, decreased to $0.01. Higher interest expense was substantially offset, by tax and other items. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.25 per share on an adjusted basis in 2024. Next, let's look at our earnings guidance. For the first quarter, this year we project to earn in the range of $2.13 per share to $2.23 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather, and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Remember last year we earned $1.97 per share in the first quarter, and as Scott stated for the full year 2025, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $5.17 to $5.27 per share. Finally, some comments on financing. In 2024, we successfully executed over $4.5 billion of external funding, including almost $200 million of common equity. In 2025, consistent with previous disclosures, we expect to issue $700 million to $800 million of common equity, via our ATM program, as well as the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, including this as a reminder, total common equity financing over the next five years is still expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3.2 billion. Going forward, to support the region's strong economic growth and our capital investment, we continue to expect any incremental capital, will be funded with 50% equity content. Overall, we are confident in our long-term EPS growth, CAGR of 6.5% to 7%. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott. Scott Lauber : Thank you, Xia. Now, as you may have seen, our Board in its January meeting, increased the dividend by 6.9% to an annualized $3.57 per share. This will mark the 22nd consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends. Overall, we are on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hi, guys. Scott Lauber : Hi, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Hi, Scott. Surprisingly, a couple of data center questions for you. First, I just want to. Scott, if it's okay, just want to touch on the recent Cloverleaf data center announcement. Looks like it's a 1,000 acre of campus in Port Washington. There's been some local headlines have kind of indicated that, there's been pushback from the constituencies and some of the local, obviously ratepayers. Could we just get a status there? What's the timing, expectations? How many megawatts is the project expected to be, and would this be incremental to your current plan? Thanks. Scott Lauber : Sure. Absolutely. So, they announced the plan up in Port Washington, which is just North of Milwaukee. And our understanding it's about 1,700 acres. So a little over the 1,000. There was an announcement at one-time being 1,000, but I think they're up to 1,700 acres now. And right now the initial look, and in their initial announcement they talk about a gigawatt of additional, which would be all incremental to our plan. I think there's, it's early stages yet. So 1,700 acres provide a lot of opportunities. And my understanding is Port Washington, and the city of Port Washington has been very, very constructive and positive on the development. So we're excited about it. I think Cloverleaf is excited about it, and looks like a good opportunity for all of us. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just sorry Scott, any opportunity would be incremental to the current plan? Scott Lauber : Correct? Correct. So that 1,800 megawatts that we talked about in our current five-year plan, that never contemplated any of this, that was just announced. And when we wait till the customers make an announcement, like I said before, we've talked to a lot of data centers, and other developers, but as they make announcements that's when we'll first start rolling them into our plan. We'll take time now as we go through the plan and working with them this summer, and when does that stage, throughout the five-year plan and into the future five-year capital. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And then just touching on just some of the recent Microsoft news. There's obviously been reports, and we're seeing it. They're acquiring more land in Wisconsin so it looks like it's full speed ahead. Obviously the deep sea headlines, have caused some confusion around U.S. spending opportunities, and then there's Stargate. Are you seeing any sort of impacts in either direction with the Microsoft spending opportunities or trajectory? So just any kind of visibility there, and is there any update on the tariff negotiations? Thanks. Scott Lauber : Sure. So in the Microsoft, in fact I was listening to the Microsoft conference call to get Intel, on what their thoughts are on DeepSeek and other conference calls, about it and everything I've heard is, if AI becomes more efficient, more people will use it, and the demand is going to still be there. So, we also internally when we saw DeepSeek and other discussions about that, we reached out to data centers and even you know, the discussion that happened in Cloverleaf is after the DeepSeek. So all our all our capacity plans, and all our growth plans are still intact. There's no changes there. So that's been all very positive what we have seen. And just to be very clear, there was an area, two areas in the Microsoft project that was paused. The one area has been release of the pause, design issues that they're looking at. And then the other area is still being reviewed, on design items that they're looking at. I think, it has to deal with looking at a closed loop water system, so that we expect to get more information on that in the next couple months. So all moving forward there, we're actively working with these large, very large customers on tariffs. We expect something probably in the next six months that, we'll be filing with them. But, we're all aligned on what we need to do in order, to be fair on cost allocation. And they all agree they need to pay their fair share. So more to come, but all positive. Shar Pourreza : Fair enough. Scott, thanks again. Super helpful color. See you soon. Bye. Scott Lauber : Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli with UBS. Your line is open. Bill Appicelli : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, Bill. Bill Appicelli : Hi. Just going, a little bit expanding on the - incremental demand that you're seeing. I mean, as we look across, the 1,800 megawatts you guys outlined, back in Q4, can you just remind us of what the generation capacity looks like, and when you factor in the combustion turbines and some of the stuff that's in the current plan. And where does that get you in terms of net length in the system, relative to what may be another wave of incremental demand from - maybe from Cloverleaf, or from additional Microsoft development? Scott Lauber : Sure. And as we put our five-year plan together last fall with the 1,800 megawatts in the Southeastern Wisconsin region, which is all the great economic development going on in the region in addition to Microsoft. We are looking at the generation plan and the MISO rules, and really building to what we need for capacity, to support the MISO rules and the economic development. So there's not excess capacity out there. This would all be incremental support that we'd need for reliable capacity. So that will be reflected in our updated capital plans going forward? Bill Appicelli : Okay. Right. So, if projects like Cloverleaf were to come to fruition and a Microsoft expansion that, would likely need to be supported by additional generation investments? Scott Lauber : That is correct. And a lot of these investments, are looking for a mix of not just reliable gas capacity, but also renewables in a generation mix, just like we lay out in our plans. Bill Appicelli : Okay. And then, I mean, how quickly can that be developed? I mean, there's a lot of talk in the market about just the lead times, for putting in additional generation capacity, and whether or not that syncs up with sort of the development profiles, or timelines of some of the data centers and large load customers? Scott Lauber : That's a good question, because a lot of people, a lot of people have plans and everyone wants to move very fast. Would you look at to develop a data center starting with a farm field along with the transmission and the generation - it could take three to four years to get there. But that's why we're working hand in glove with them and American Transmission company to continue to grow, and what we need to do to deliver. Bill Appicelli : Okay. And then just lastly on the system modernization program hearings last week, I guess what should we make of the decision when we get it? I mean does that have any impact on the gas CapEx outlook in Illinois, in the more near term, or do we need to see what the future of natural gas proceeding kind of yields, before we can make any longer term, capital decisions? Scott Lauber : Sure. And just to give you a little color, what we currently have in our plan is approximately $90 million annually to support, facility relocates for like the city of Chicago, or any key reliability or safety issues that we need to address. So it's about $90 million. In our filings we talked about in order to get back to a plan that would take up, to about 300 million of capital. Now remember, the decision will come, we expect in February and we'll kind of gauge what's going off of their decision. But it would take a while to ramp up, because remember we were told to pause and stop all activity and reduce that spending. So we'd have to put more contracts in place, go through the permitting, go through the engineering, all of that. So take a while to ramp up. But we'll see what comes out of that decision in February. We expect it in February, March. Bill Appicelli : All right, great. Thank you so much. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hi team, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start off, any updates on Point Beach. I know you were kind of talking with NextEra. Are there any updates there since we last spoke? Scott Lauber : No, there really hasn't been any updates. And just so everyone recalls, the contract at Point Beach, the first lease ends in 2030 and the PPA, the second PPA ends in 2033. So it's not, it's not a fire drill that we're actively at it, and you could, we've been busy with a lot of stuff. And I think you can tell NextEra has been busy on a lot of stuff. So it hasn't been on the front burner for all of us. I expect, we'll have more information in the first half of the year. Durgesh Chopra : That's perfect. Thank you, Scott. And then, maybe just a big picture question, with these tariffs, how should we - how should investors think about implications to Wisconsin and just broadly utilities? Seems like these China tariffs are in effect right now. We're not sure how long they'll last. But how are you thinking through all of this? Scott Lauber : Well, we're watching them very closely, as you can imagine. In the China tariffs could affect us somewhat, when you think about some of the solar projects we have, and some of the sourcing that's needed. But once again, it's not a large part of the solar projects. So we think it's very manageable where they're currently at. And the tariffs that we, potentially out of Canada, Canada and Mexico. We were watching very closely also, along with the cost of gas. But even with the cost of gas, when you're watching it at a 10% tariff that, was moving that gas cost from $3 to $3.30 and that's a small portion of the gas supply that we have. And we saw the gas prices move a lot faster, with just some cold weather coming across. So, we think it's going to be manageable, but we're watching them very closely. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you, Scott. Really appreciate the time. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Carly Davenport : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. You referenced before renewable capacity as being part, of what is being considered by some of these large load customers. I guess do you see any implications from new policy priorities post inauguration that could potentially impact the cadence of your capital investment in renewables? Scott Lauber : There's a potential and we're evaluating all of that, as we see what goes on with the administration, and the tariffs and production tax credits. However, I do think, that production, the PTCs will continue, and they won't just be phased out immediately. I think there's a longer term benefit for a lot of people, a lot of construction jobs, a lot of value for our customers. So I'm not anticipating big changes there. But of course all of us, including large customers are watching it. But at this time I don't see any issues on the horizon. Carly Davenport : Got it. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just a housekeeping item. Just with the O&M coming in lower in 2024, versus your expectations. Any color that you can provide, on how we should think about the year-over-year impacts for O&M looking to 2025? Scott Lauber : Sure. And I'll let. And remember, there's a lot of this, because of individual projects didn't come into service. And a lot of new projects are coming online in 2025. But Xia has pulled together some analysis. I'll let her walk you through it. Xia Liu : Yes, Carly. So over, remember, '24 came in about 5% less than what we originally forecasted. And some of that is short-term initiatives to offset the mild heating season. And some of that is delayed of capital put in service. So we need to restore that kind of run rate first of all. And on top of that we have new projects, we will put in service this year. And also in the current, the last weekly season Wisconsin, the commission approved some increase in reliability spending, particularly for vegetation management. If you add all those moving pieces, it could be a relatively bigger growth year-over-year, but it's all like - driven by the factors I mentioned already. Carly Davenport : Got it. And when you say higher relative growth year-over-year, are you talking about in reference to the original guidance for '24, or where you actually ended up coming in? Xia Liu : When compared to original guidance, it's pretty normal. But if you compare to what 2024 came in, it could be, I don't know, 8% to 10% growth year-over year. Carly Davenport : Okay. Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks so much for the time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good afternoon team. Thank you guys very much. Hope you guys are doing well. Scott Lauber : Yes, thanks, Julien. Yes, we're doing great in Wisconsin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Hi, just a couple cleanup items here following up first in Illinois. I want to come back to this, because that staff recommendation for Option 3 at seven point, this was $1.9 billion. That was a big number. Obviously you've put in, a fairly modest plan here. How much of a delta is there, versus what you guys have reflected? I mean I just again, I get that apples-to-apples is difficult to discern at times, but how would you characterize that, as far as the comparison? Scott Lauber : Sure. And to get up to that staff number, because they even said we should maybe do it at the same pace, or even a little bit faster. To get up to that staff number, we'd have to ramp up to $300 million to maybe $350 million a year in the short-term. And then, go higher than that as you get through just with - you're factored in just different inflation and stuff. So we'll see where that goes. But that would be, 200, so a little over $200 million more than what's annually more than what's in our plan. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right, thanks for trying to reconcile. I know it's tricky on the fly here, and then just going back to. I know there's been a lot of focus on the data center stuff, but I just want to make sure I got this right here. Do we know the quantum of megawatts? I thought there was like a 3 gigawatt number out there with Cloverleaf? Do we have any sense of timing at all on the ramp? And similarly for Phase 3, what would be contemplated on ramp? I just want to make sure - I have a sense from you even, which you were to get details here the quantum of gigawatts, and especially the ramp rate. And would this be ready for like a, some updates this year? It sounds like Maybe that's not a '25 event in as much as it could take some time to come together on those issues? Scott Lauber : Sure, sure. In Cloverleaf you know, it is a tremendously nice site. It's a great opportunity. And in our prepared remarks we said a gigawatt. I have heard that it could be significantly larger. Like you mentioned. I anticipate that if things continue to move as they have that we could start seeing some construction perhaps this fall. But that ramp rate, then to actually get to energy flowing probably would take three to four years, I would imagine to flow substantial amounts. So probably in that '28 or '29 timeframe. But we're working with them, and working with American Transmission Company to provide services, as fast as they can. They need it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Phase 3 says similar dynamic that maybe - the punchline is would you expect there to be kind of a tangible update, by the end of this year, kind of in your normal course\u2026? Scott Lauber : Absolutely. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just to set expectations today? Scott Lauber : Absolutely. Okay. Great. Yes, I think - there'll be more of an update, by the end of this year absolutely, with our updated five-year plan. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the time. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : My first question, and you might have just been alluding to this a moment ago, but I was wondering when we might get the next updates to the long-term spending plans. You typically give those in November. I know, but you've already mentioned $2 billion of MISO transmission spending with maybe almost $2 billion more to come soon. The Cloverleaf spending adding, more incremental CapEx and possibly some other needs. Should we expect to hear anything between now and November, or would we wait till the later in the year for your typical timing? Scott Lauber : Sure, that's a great question. And just to set expectations, I anticipate it'll be in that October, November time frame and here's why. The American transmission growth that we're talking about 2.1, that's most likely in that '28, '29, more in the '29, '30 and past timeframe. So later out farther. So it really won't affect this five-year plan as much. And then as you think about these additional megawatt hour sales potential. As we said, it'll take a while to ramp up, probably later in the five-year plan, and we'll pull all those plans together right now. So it's not like it's really going to affect dramatically in '25 or '26 or '27 probably. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And then, I guess similar question on the regulatory front. You obviously just completed your two-year rate case in Wisconsin, but you'll probably need to make some important investment decisions, sooner than the next rate cases. So you made the comment about a quiet regulatory calendar, but how do we juxtapose that with a very busy environment, with economic development? Scott Lauber : Sure, that is a very good question. And we have from a rate case perspective, it's very quiet. From a Wisconsin perspective, as we have significant number of projects at the commission right now for approval. So I think we have close to $5 billion of projects sitting at the commission between, the gas generation which includes CTs and RICE units, a gas lateral, the LNG plant that we put in service to have that additional reliability, plus solar, wind and some battery capacity. There's a lot of projects at the commission to get approval. When they get approval, they get approved, which we anticipate some of the gas turbines to get approved by, probably in the second or third quarter. We'll start construction and during that period, we're really incurring or earning AFUDC on those projects. And then, they'll go into future rates, and probably future rate cases. It takes a while to build. So we do have a, a very busy schedule getting approval on projects. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And one last one. At WEC Infrastructure, I believe you've now completed all of your planned spending for the five-year outlook. So first question, am I correct that 2025 will still have some earnings growth thanks to the recently completed projects? And then second, how do you think about your appetite for incremental unregulated projects? You obviously have a ton of utility opportunities. How do you think about the opportunity for more stuff at [WECKY]. Scott Lauber : Sure. And you described it very well. We've had two projects that came in the end of last year. One we expect to close, the next one we expect to close in the first quarter this year. So there's incremental, which includes incremental production tax credits. But you hit the nail on the head. We have so much growth in Wisconsin and American Transmission Company that, right now we don't have anything in our plans for that WEC infrastructure. Now, never say never, but right now we really don't have any plans in that infrastructure, because we have so much to execute within the utilities. Andrew Weisel : All right, very good. Thank you. Scott Lauber : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hi, hi. Scott. Wanted to go back to just the sales growth conversation. I think, given everything seems on track with maybe even upward bias, I think you're pointing to just shy of a 1% growth, on the electric side this year. Are we going to get into that like 4.5%, 5% range by next year? Is that still a fair assumption to work with? Scott Lauber : Yes, and Xia has looked at that. We're slowly going to start to see some ramp up. But really the big stuff goes into service in 2026. Xia any other? Xia Liu : No, I think that's it. Embedded in that 0.7% growth is the LC&I growth, which is about 1.9%, Michael. So that's a good, nice ramp up from, where we landed in 2024. And I mean, everybody is focused on data centers, but we really have really good growth across all the 16 sectors that we track. Just to give you a sense, 11 of the 16 sectors last year had positive or relatively flat growth by the end of 2024. So we feel really good about the forecast for '25, and we think the 4.5% to 5% will be reached maybe in the, I don't know, late 2026 time frame. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Very helpful. Appreciate the color there. And then switching back to the ATC side of things, just the upside potential beyond the $2.1 billion. When would you anticipate getting some clarity on that? Whether it be competitive bids or the ROFR option? Scott Lauber : Sure. And the ROFR option, American Transmission Company is working with the legislature, to hopefully get something adopted, or proposed and hopefully approved in this quarter or this first half of the year. And then I think if there's a bidding option, I think those bids would be required. If we don't get the ROFR, those bids you require probably in the first half of this year, too. So more would come in the next couple next year or so here. Now, when we look at the ROFR and the ROFR, when you're in Wisconsin and you have the ROFR, it's a great investment for our - for American Transmission Company. But it also, when you look at the cost and how they're allocated, it's a good investment also for our Wisconsin customers. It saves money for them, too. So we think there's a great opportunity for the ROFR in Wisconsin. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi, Jeremy, how you doing? Jeremy Tonet : Good. How about yourself? Scott Lauber : Not bad, not bad, good. Jeremy Tonet : Just a real quick one from me, right. I was thinking with regards to your experience with the RICE engines there. We hear a lot about speed to market these days. Do you think your experience with RICE units, be it at the utility or WECKY would offer you kind of the ability to give a differentiated service as it relates to speed to market? Scott Lauber : Well, that's a good question. And we have the RICE units in our plan. We've got three sites of RICE units up and running. Very happy with the RICE units. And we have a combination of RICE units along with CTs. So we look at it, kind of at all of the above and how do we grow our generation to be reliable? And RICE units is just part of the complement. I don't know. I think it's good to have them part of our mix. But I don't know, if we just go 100% with RICE units or CT. So it's been a combination. So they're very good and they've been very effective for us, as we've been using them in our load here for a couple years now. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. Thanks. And I might have missed it earlier, if you touched on it already. Sorry, but any thoughts on OpenAI CFO mentioning Wisconsin, as a possible data center site, and beyond Microsoft? Could you walk us through your ability to accommodate if you do get more of these, more people coming in? Scott Lauber : Sure. And like I said, our development people are talking all the time with potential opportunities, and we work with them and kind of lay out the game plan. You need to get transmission, but in order to get orders in and stuff, you need to significant in, your purchase cancellation agreements, to protect our core customers. So we're working with a variety of people. So potentially there's even more out there. But we just got to get into the queue, and lay out a game plan with them. So there's always more potential. Jeremy Tonet : Got a quick last one if I could. With all this hitting in the back end of the plan, how do you think this might impact the CAGR? Scott Lauber : We're going to put all that together this summer as we look at our fall here, and we'll update that and whatever we decide to do, they'll come on our third quarter call. Jeremy Tonet : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Your line is open. Paul Fremont : Thank you. Quick question of clarification for the sort of for the Microsoft pause. My understanding is that the closed loop design, is also being used in Arizona. Is the pause, Wisconsin specific, or is it more generic to all of their facilities that are going to use the closed loop design? Scott Lauber : Well, I don't know the specifics of what's going on the other projects. I did read that there, projects going forward, new projects including Arizona and Mount Pleasant will pilot, zero water evaporating designs in 2026. So I can't speak to the other projects in Microsoft's area. I know ours is a short pause here, and they've already started one of the sites back up. It's just the one that's on a pause still. Paul Fremont : Great. And then just a quick question on sort of any comments on the NextEra GE Vernova partnership and what impact that might have on the availability of gas turbines, as you move out into the future? Scott Lauber : That's a good question. And what we have in our five-year plan, we have already sites to that generation, and we'll see what the demand is, as we continue to work with our large customers for '29, '30, '31. I mean there's no doubt that GE is probably ramping up their supply, and their ability deliver more units. So we'll see where it goes. Xia Liu : Paul, the good news for us is our current CTS and generation plan. In the current five-year plan, we already signed the contract, so we're ready to move right now for this phase. Paul Fremont : Thank you. Thank you very much. Scott Lauber : Thanks Paul. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Hi, good afternoon. Scott Lauber : Hi Paul. Paul Patterson : Just a few quick questions so on. In Illinois, when you guys had your gas case, there was an Ameren gas case that, was kind of at the same time frame. And they've gotten an order from the appeals court that reversed some of the denials, or some of the denials and what have you. And I was wondering how you felt, how that. If that has any - impact on your thoughts regarding, the gas situation would you set your S&P, or your other. I think you guys also appealed your gas case, or if I'm not wrong, if there's any maybe carryover there that you might be thinking about? Scott Lauber : Sure, that's a good question. And I did see where some of those repeals were sent back to the commission. And we also have appealed our rate case order specifically, as it related to some of our service center facilities that were denied 100%, and other aspects of the case. We'll see where our appeals go as it relates to the S&P. I think we'll, I think our record was very clear. It's needed for reliability. It's needed for safety. There's a lot of old pipes in the city of Chicago. In fact, we're working on one back from 1861. So I think the facts of the case are going to drive it as the S&P for what we'll see in the next quarter here. On the appeal, we'll see where the court goes with our appeal. I think it's in a different circuit, but it's somewhat positive to see appeal that Ameren won, a few of them to go back to the commission. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then finally, just a. Just a bookkeeping on the extinguishment of debt. What are your expectations in going forward, on what kind of opportunities might be there with respect to that category? Xia Liu : Well, we've been using that as a, you know, I don't know. It's not in the plan, but we try to be opportunistic. Last December, when we extinguished some of the debt, we were able to realize some gain, but really also kind of neutral for 2025. So we want to be flexible. And if. If you have a really bad year in weather, or something, that could be a tool for us to consider. And so, but it's not in the base plan. Scott Lauber : And we'll have to also see what the market's like at that time. Xia Liu : Exactly. Paul Patterson : Okay. And the opportunities are being driven pretty much by interest rates. Is that how we should think about it, or is there anything else? Something unusual that doesn't come to mind? Xia Liu : We'll see market conditions, interest rates, and everything around it. Paul Patterson : Awesome. Thanks so much. Scott Lauber : Thank you. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for participating. If you have any more questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation.
