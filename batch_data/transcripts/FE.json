Now I will turn the call over to Tony Alexander. Anthony J. Alexander: Thank you, Meghan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today's call with a look at our first quarter results, then I will discuss some of the recent developments in each of our businesses, and I'll finish with an update on our full year outlook. Leila will provide a more in-depth review of our competitive business, as well as an update on regulatory activity. And Jim will present more details on our first quarter financial results. Okay, let's get started. This morning, we announced first quarter 2014 operating earnings of $0.39 per share, in line with the range we provided on our year-end call in February. Even though the extremely challenging weather continued throughout the quarter for our competitive business, we had good results overall in both our distribution and transmission businesses. In fact, our distribution business not only delivered strong performance during the quarter, but even more important, we continued to see positive trends in both residential and commercial sales, as well as growth in the industrial sector. Adjusting for the impact of weather, total distribution sales increased 2% compared to the first quarter of 2013. This includes an increase of nearly 3% on a weather-adjusted basis in the commercial sector. We are obviously pleased to see consecutive quarters of sales growth in the commercial sector. Weather-adjusted residential deliveries increased more than 2% compared to the first quarter of 2013, and we saw modest growth in our customer count, continuing the positive trend we noted during the fourth quarter. Sales to industrial customers increased about 1% compared to the first quarter of 2013, driven by manufacturing segments related to shale gas in our region, as well as continued steady growth from the automotive sector. We also welcomed the announcement in March of a planned ethanol cracker plant in our Mon Power service territory. While this project is still in its early stages, the land has been purchased, and we remain optimistic that our region is prime for a cracker plant. This development would be a tremendous boost to not only the shale gas industry in our region, but related manufacturing sectors across our service areas. Our first quarter distribution results, together with the growing momentum in the shale gas industry, sustained our cautious optimism that a more substantial recovery is on the horizon for both the commercial and industrial sectors. We are on track to meet or exceed our growth forecast for all 3 sectors this year. On the regulatory front, we filed our rate case in West Virginia last week, and we expect to file an ESP in Ohio and rate cases in Pennsylvania -- in our Pennsylvania service areas later this year. We are also looking forward to resolution of our New Jersey storm recovery and base rate cases. Leila will provide more details on each of these cases later today. Finally, in our transmission business, we are moving forward with our planned investments to support continued service, system reliability and enhance service to our customers. Projects underway include construction of our 100-mile transmission line from our Bruce Mansfield Plant to a new substation in the Cleveland area. This project is being constructed primarily to support the generation deactivations in the ATSI footprint. In addition, we are well underway on many of the smaller projects that are part of our transmission improvement program. While we did lose some physical construction time this winter due to the weather, we still expect to meet our targets for the year. Now turning to our competitive operations. While Leila and Jim will provide more detail about the specific impact the extreme winter weather and, more importantly, market conditions had on our competitive business, I'll take a moment to discuss what this winter's instability says about the state of our region's electric infrastructure. As you know, the regional grid was under severe stress during the polar vortex in early January and other frigid weather events in the remainder of the quarter. The combination of several factors, including high customer demand, forced outages and plant unavailability, in particular those driven by gas shortages, illuminated the fact that current energy priorities are putting the reliability of our electric system in jeopardy and creating a far more volatile energy price and service environment for customers. This is of particular importance in competitive states, where customer service and pricing are very much dependent, if not solely dependent, on stable and predictable wholesale markets. As you may know, we've shared this view in our testimony at FERC, in comments to business leaders and legislators and in media, and we will continue to advocate for regulatory changes that can ensure generating resources are valued at a level that reflects their contribution to grid reliability. While some modest reforms dealing with overreliance on imports and demand response have been approved by the FERC for the upcoming PJM capacity auction in May, we believe momentum is growing for changes that can truly help maintain the reliability, service quality and price stability that have long been enjoyed from our electric system. Even so, we are evaluating our target level of retail sales, including the markets and channels in which we concentrate our efforts and our hedge position, given the significant volatility now within the wholesale energy markets, the ever-changing market rules and, as we approach mid-2015 and beyond, the anticipated shutdowns of generation within the market. It has always been a part of our overall strategy to maximize the performance of our competitive business. As we evaluate and refine our targets in light of current market conditions, we are in a good position, since we only have about 55% of our generation committed for the 2015, 2016 PJM planning year and about 33% committed for the 2016, 2017 planning year. This gives us substantial flexibility as we consider how best to position our competitive business going forward. With respect to our plant performance during the quarter, even though our overall fleet performed better than expected -- in fact, we delivered more capacity to PJM than our units were committed to deliver or were being paid for -- we had several nuclear and fossil outages and derates that occurred during the most volatile pricing periods. And as Leila will explain, these outages, given the high prices for energy during those periods, had a significant impact on our results. During the quarter, we also successfully replaced the Unit 1 main transformer during the forced outage at Beaver Valley plant in January and commenced the Davis-Besse steam generator replacement project during a planned refueling outage. Davis-Besse is now in the startup process, but the outage took 15-or-so days longer than expected, which we estimate will result in about a $0.02 impact for the second quarter. In April, we also began the scheduled refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2. The outage is on track, and we expect that unit back online during May. We have no other refueling outages scheduled this year. This morning, we revised our 2014 operating earnings guidance to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. It was a tough quarter for our competitive operations, given the market dynamics in PJM, and we have adjusted the earnings range at that segment to reflect the quarter's results and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our corporate segment and regulated utilities are expected to come in better than our original estimates, and our transmission segment is roughly in line with original expectations. While this is a very difficult quarter, we continue to believe that our distribution, transmission and competitive businesses provide a solid platform to deliver value to our investors, and we appreciate your support. Now I'll turn this over to Leila for a regulatory and power markets update. Leila L. Vespoli: Thanks, Tony. Given the significance of the extreme weather and market conditions on our competitive business, I will begin with a discussion of the first quarter impact and then move to a regulatory update. First, extreme weather conditions resulted in customer usage that was about 6% higher than normal during the first quarter. We typically hedge for normal weather, leaving open a small portion of our expected customer load as we enter each month. Increased sales are covered through market purchases, from our peaking generation or a combination of both. This quarter, higher market purchases, reflecting weather and, to a lesser extent, our small open position of less than 3%, decreased earnings by $0.10 per share net of increased sales revenues. Higher prices exasperated the earnings impact of our power purchases. Average prices during the first quarter 2014 were nearly $68 per megawatt-hour or double the 3-year average of about $34 per megawatt-hour. More importantly, however, prices during the most volatile days, the 10 highest-priced days during the quarter, where the average around-the-clock day-ahead price at 80 Hub was between $150 and $500 per megawatt-hour, were what really impacted the quarter's results at our competitive segment. All 10 of these volatile days coincided with untimely outages at some of our units, including Beaver Valley and Mansfield. And we couldn't procure natural gas for our West Lorain peaking plant, which would have helped offset some of that impact. The combination of these events, net of fuel costs and better-than-expected generation at other units, resulted in increased power purchase expense of $0.23 per share. The impact of the 10 days was $0.13 of the $0.23. Ancillary expenses from PJM were also up significantly as a result of January charges that were about 10x higher than normal and that exceeded the charges for the entire calendar year 2013. While we anticipated significant ancillary charges when we spoke to you in February, PJM added a March true-up bill of roughly $0.02 per share, reflecting their decision to socialize these costs across the entire region. Our total share of these expenses amounted to $0.10 per share, while the net effect on earnings was $0.05 per share, reflecting a passthrough of some of these costs to industrial and commercial customers, as well as our decision not to seek reimbursement for about $0.02 in expenses from residential customers. Looking at other drivers. Higher capacity prices drove a $0.07 per share increase in capacity expense. And finally, the deactivation of Hatfield and Mitchell, along with the transfer of Harrison and the hydro unit, improved earnings $0.04 per share, taking into consideration lower fuel, operation, depreciation and interest expense and increased purchase power to replace that generation. As Tony said, we continue our work to encourage consistent and reasonable market rules that help rather than hinder competitive markets, and we are committed to advocating for change in rules, policies and practices that better support reliability and overall market development. At the same time we are working for change, we are also taking several steps to refine our internal practices to adapt to the evolving market dynamics. First, we are taking a far more conservative approach in competitive markets, in light of our current condition. We have increased the risk premium that is built into our retail sales price, which should naturally adjust our glide path strategy to produce a slightly more open position. We currently have 56 million megawatt-hours of committed sales in 2015 and 32 million megawatt-hours committed in 2016. Next, we have taken deliberate action to essentially close the small, unhedged portion that we typically leave open going into each month, and that is in place for the remainder of the year. As we move into the summer months, we have taken additional actions to layer in further hedges that supplement our position for retail load. Our peaking units are also available for additional support in the event of an extremely hot summer and more volatile prices. Finally, we have purchased additional outage insurance, something that we haven't felt necessary for about 15 years, to mitigate the impact of volatile prices during the summer. Our results this quarter were affected by a mix of untimely outages and extreme market conditions. We believe that the actions we have already implemented, as well as other conservative measures for the longer term, will help to mitigate the impact of similar market condition should they occur in the future. Moving now to a review of state regulatory matters. In New Jersey, following the BPU's approval of storm cost stipulation and the return of the 2011 storm costs to the base rate case, the parties were directed to advise ALJ whether additional information is needed before the record is closed. We anticipate a decision in the rate case proceeding later this year. Also in New Jersey, the manner of recovery of the 2012 storm cost remains pending before the BPU. Turning to West Virginia. Before I talk about our recently filed rate case, I want to briefly mention that on April 23, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia entered an opinion affirming the West Virginia Public Service Commission's order from last October approving the generation asset transfer dealing with the Harrison and Pleasants generating station. As you may recall, we closed this transaction in October after receiving approval from the West Virginia PSC. Now respecting the West Virginia rate case, last week, our Mon Power and Potomac Edison subsidiaries jointly submitted a request to the Public Service Commission of West Virginia for a base rate increase of approximately $96 million or 9.3% and an allowed ROE of 11%. In addition, the plan includes the request to recover the cost of a new right-of-way vegetation maintenance program through a surcharge. Recently, the West Virginia PSC approved the company's vegetation management plan filed last year but postponed consideration of the method of cost recovery to the rate case. In the meantime, as authorized by the PSC, the companies are implementing the plan and deferring the cost with a 4% annual carry charge. If the requested surcharge is not approved in the rate case, these costs would be incorporated into the company's base rate request. The requested rates are subject to review and approval by the PSC. We expect the case to conclude by the end of February 2015 With respect to our plans to file base rate cases in Pennsylvania, we are concluding our analysis and expect to file later this year. And finally, in Pennsylvania, on March 6, the PUC issued an order approving our original smart meter deployment plan. On March 19, the company has filed an updated plan, consistent with that order, that would allow for the entire Penn Power smart meter system, 170,000 meters, to be built by the end of 2015 instead of the originally proposed installation of 60,000 meters by the end of 2016. A procedural schedule, including a hearing tomorrow, has been established to allow the Pennsylvania PUC to consider the plan by early June. We expect installation to begin this summer. In Ohio, the PUCO completed its retail market investigation on March 26 by issuing an order that addresses issues ranging from maintaining SSO service in its current form to requiring corporate separation audits of all electric distribution utilities. Also in Ohio, we expect to file an electric security plan, or ESP, before year end. As you know, the current ESP runs through May of 2016, but we need to get started on the process in order to meet the time required to effectively implement a new plant. We expect that most of the main aspects of the filing will be similar, including the continuation of periodic auctions to procure generation for non-shopping customers, as well as the delivery capital recovery rider, which has served us well in terms of providing a mechanism to recover our ongoing investments in reliability at our Ohio utilities. We are also considering, given the substantial changes in market conditions, whether we should propose an option designed to provide our Ohio customers with more generation price stability and reduced exposure to market volatility. We're still in the early stages of this, and a lot -- and obviously, a lot of thought and discussion with our Ohio colleagues is still to come. It may prove, however, to be an effective way, and perhaps the only way, for Ohio regulators to address the volatility in the market and assure stable prices and adequate supplies for Ohio customers. With that, I'll hand it off to Jim. James F. Pearson: Thanks, Leila. As I discuss our financial results, you may want to refer to the consolidated report, which was issued this morning and is available on our website. You'll notice that we have redesigned the consolidated report to provide even greater transparency into the performance of our 3 business units : regulated distribution, regulated transmission and competitive energy services. As Tony mentioned earlier, our first quarter operating earnings of $0.39 per share were within our expectations. These results compare to first quarter 2013 operating earnings of $0.76 per share. On a GAAP basis, first quarter earnings were $0.50 per share this year compared to $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2013. A list of special items that make up the difference between GAAP and operating earnings can be found on Page 2 of the consolidated report. The largest of the special items in the first quarter was an $0.18 per share gain primarily related to the sale of our hydro units. We also recorded a gain of $0.03 per share related to mark-to-market adjustments. These gains were partially offset by plant deactivation costs of $0.05 per share associated with the closure of our fossil units, a decrease of $0.02 per share related to merger accounting for commodity contracts, regulatory charges of $0.02 per share and a loss on debt redemptions of $0.01 per share. Now let's turn to a review of the key drivers in each of our business segments. I'll begin with our distribution business, with operating earnings of $0.53 per share or an increase of $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013. Distribution deliveries added $0.09 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013. Heating degree-days were about 17% higher than 2013 and 19% above normal, driving a 6% or 2.3 million megawatt-hour increase in deliveries compared to the first quarter of 2013. Looking at the mix of sales, deliveries to residential customers were up 11%, while commercial sales increased 6%. And as Tony mentioned earlier, when we adjust for the impact of weather, commercial deliveries were up nearly 3%, while residential sales increased about 2%. Deliveries to industrial customers were 1% higher than the first quarter of 2013. Looking back at the past 12 months. On a weather-adjusted basis, we are seeing about a 1% growth in both the residential and commercial sectors and a 2% increase in industrial deliveries. The growth appears to be somewhat steady. And to reiterate Tony's point, we are in pace to achieve the expected load growth across all 3 sectors of our customer segments this year. With respect to other drivers in our distribution business, the impact of the West Virginia asset transfer, primarily reflecting the return on the Harrison Plant, increased earnings by $0.01 per share in the first quarter. The weather contributed to higher operating expenses of $0.06 per share during the quarter. This primarily reflects less capital work completed as a result of the extreme weather conditions and storm-related restoration costs, net of deferrals during the quarter. Finally, distribution earnings decreased by $0.03 per share as a result of higher depreciation and interest expense. Moving to our transmission business. Operating earnings were $0.12 per share or flat compared to the first quarter of 2013 as higher transmission revenues were offset by operating expense and taxes, with most of the higher operating expense due to a greater focus on maintenance activities this quarter. In our competitive business, operating earnings were $0.40 per share below first quarter 2013 results. This was driven by the decrease in commodity margin that resulted from the extreme weather, market conditions and outages that we experienced during the quarter, as Leila described. Total generating output decreased 4.9 million megawatt-hours, primarily reflecting our 2013 plant deactivations, the Harrison and Pleasants asset transfer and planned and unplanned outages. Total contract sales increased 1.3 million megawatt-hours compared to the first quarter of 2013. The total number of retail customers remained flat at 2.7 million, but the channel mix is shifting, consistent with our strategy to target higher-margin sales opportunities. Specifically, direct sales to the large and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers decreased 6% as a result of our strategy to be more selective in light of current market conditions. This decrease was offset in the first quarter by sales in other channels. Structured sales increased 42% compared to the first quarter of 2013 as a result of more municipal, cooperative and bilateral sales, partially offset by lower unit prices due to extreme weather and market conditions that reduced the gains on various structured financial sales. Governmental aggregation sales increased 7%, and POLR sales increased 8%, both reflecting higher weather-related usage. And mass market sales were 19% higher, reflecting the acquisition of new customers, primarily in Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as weather-related usage. The impact of the extreme weather and market events on commodity margin was offset somewhat by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the plant deactivations and the asset transfer, and lower interest expense due to long-term debt repurchases. Finally, I'll take a moment to review financing options that we have completed so far this year. We extended our 3 existing multiyear revolving credit facilities until March of 2019. As part of this transaction, we increased the FirstEnergy and utility facility by $1 billion, we decreased the FES and Allegheny supply facility by $1 billion and amended the transmission facility to allow greater borrowing at our ATSI and TrAIL subsidiaries. We executed and fully utilized a new $1 billion variable-rate term loan credit agreement with a maturity date of March 2019. Borrowings under this term loan improved our liquidity, as we used proceeds to refinance a like amount of borrowings under FE Corp.'s revolving credit facility. We completed the remarketing of 3 tax-exempt issues totaling $417 million in March at an average coupon of 3.86%, and we received FERC authorization to issue up to $850 million in long-term debt for TrAIL. While the first quarter presented some unusual challenges with regard to the extreme weather and market conditions, we were pleased overall with the strength of our businesses and our regulated strategy, and we'll continue to focus on our core businesses with a commitment to operational excellence, financial discipline and predictable and sustainable growth opportunities. Now I'll open the call up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Can we just talk a little bit about kind of retail thought process? I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of a reevaluation of kind of sizing and strategy there. Given the first quarter results, what's going to cause you guys maybe to reconsider how much of a short position you create in the retail business? And based on your contractual commitments, where would you look to maybe reduce your exposure if you're going to maybe more balance that business? Anthony J. Alexander: Dan, let me start with kind of a broad-based overview. When you think about our retail strategy, we've always indicated that it is primarily an asset-backed strategy. And we have used -- and we've increased sales, to a certain extent, probably in the 20% to 25% range, based on sourcing from the overall market. We've been comfortable in that range for a number of years now because the markets have been fairly stable. What we're seeing today, however, and what we experienced this winter, perhaps, is a precursor of what we might be looking at down the road as additional generation is taken offline as a result of environmental requirements, increasing forced outage rates as a result of -- essentially, as a result of depressed overall capacity markets. And quite frankly, as we rely more on natural gas to fill the capacity void, the increased volatility that creates inside the energy markets, electric energy markets because of the volatility associated with natural gas. And I think all of those are looking -- all of those are leading us to refine our strategy, to see exactly where these targets ought to be, given what we're seeing now as perhaps something that is going to be more of a long-term event in the energy markets, in particular. So not unlike where we started the process, what level of retail sales are -- can be supported by our generation, what is the appropriate level of retail sales to source in the market, if any, and where that mix is will depend much on what happens in retail markets to reflect the risk premiums that will need to be reflected as wholesale markets have far more volatile energy prices in them. And we're going to take that all into consideration. Right now, I feel pretty good about where we're at because the positions we have going forward, quite frankly, where we're at right now, we're more than 100% hedged with our own generation. So it becomes a function of what markets will provide the best opportunities for the competitive business going forward. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And I guess, if you look at guidance for this year, the update to the CES contribution came down quite a bit, even though you guys hit the midpoint of the range for the first quarter in aggregate. What's bringing down the next 3 quarters of CES, probably, relative to plan? And then what is the cost or the ongoing cost of, maybe, the new hedging or insurance strategies you're using this year to help protect yourselves? James F. Pearson: Dan, this is Jim. I'll take a shot at that, and then if Leila and Donny want to add any more cover, I'll hand -- color, I'll hand that off to them. Yes, we hit the midrange of our guidance for this quarter, but several things happened since we gave that guidance, Dan. First off, during the quarter, we did experience better results in our regulated distribution business than what we had expected. We knew that we were going to have higher expenses in the first quarter associated with maintenance expenses, but our revenues were somewhat better than what we expected. And then on the corporate side, we also experienced some benefits against some taxes to a couple of cents. What happened since the call, on the competitive side, we decided that we were not going to bill several cents of the ancillary services. In addition, PJM reallocated some of their expenses from January, and that impacted us by about $0.02. And then March was rather challenging, as we experienced some fairly cold weather and some extreme wholesale market prices on that side of the house. So with that, we had a decrease somewhat in the competitive side. It was offset, though, by the corporate and the regulated distribution side. Looking past the first quarter, Dan, we had some additional expenditures that impacted us. First, the Davis-Besse outage that Tony talked about earlier, it impacted us by a couple of cents. And then we also went out and we bought some additional outage insurance, and we closed all of the remaining positions that were opened for the remainder of the year. So when you take all of that together, that is what drove the midpoint of the competitive energy services from $0.42 to $0.17. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And so Jim, when you guys look at next year and beyond, should we assume that this higher level of cost for insurance or locking-in-positions is going to be there? Or is that part of the review of where the retail scaling should be? James F. Pearson: I would say that, that will be part of what the retail review and scaling will be. But at this point, I'm not really expecting that we will go out and purchase that outage insurance on an annual basis. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So quick first question here. As you think about the impact of polar vortex, et cetera, in the state of Ohio, how are you seeing their willingness to, perhaps, engage in a more longer-term, PPA-like manner with you all and perhaps how that meshes with your upcoming ESP? Leila L. Vespoli: Julien, this is Leila. I think they are very focused on that. I think Ohio is not alone in their concern at looking at the polar vortex and the market rules and what they mean in term -- potentially mean in terms of reliability going forward. And I think you're right here in the sense that they dovetail into what might folks want to see within the context of an ESP going forward. So those are the kinds of things that we are looking at now and talking with folks in Ohio about to see what it is that we might do in Ohio that's provided for under Ohio law that might mitigate some of the reliability issues with respect to that and to ensure that they have stable pricing in Ohio. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Could you perhaps just elaborate? How big or substantial are we talking about? What's the ambition here, just to get a better sense? Leila L. Vespoli: Julien, I -- that is something that's actively being considered. I mean, that's something that we wouldn't decide solely at our end. We would want to be talking with folks and discuss what is the appetite for this kind of things. So that's the thing that's under discussion right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Excellent. And then on the capacity piece, I'd be curious; obviously, you have a capacity auction coming up. What's your latest thoughts on ATSI are and, ultimately, how that dovetails with, I suppose, your April proposal to shift some of the offered cap [ph] rule. Leila L. Vespoli: Okay. I'll talk about it generally then turn it over to Donny to maybe give you some more specifics. I think with regard to what FERC has already approved, I think it will have the potential to move the auction a little bit. But I don't think any of the rules currently approved are going to move the auction substantially. I don't think that's consistent with what I'm reading out there. I think longer term, Julien, and what some folks in the industry are talking about among themselves and now with some regulators from a federal level perspective, in order to fix the uneconomic generation issue that folks are talking about, that the Market Monitor talked about in his report, you're going to need more than what PJM has proposed to FERC right now. You're going to need additional changes, both in terms of base residual auction changes that, obviously, wouldn't take place until 3 years out, so I'll call that a longer-term fix. But you have some companies, Exelon notably one of them, that says they're looking to make decisions in the shorter term. And folks are going to have to concentrate and look at, \"Okay, what might be a shorter-term fix that will take us to a place where you then have fixed the base residual auction 3 years out?\" One of the things that folks are talking about is on-site fuel and looking to give units with on-site fuel some kind of premium in a market that they certainly don't get now, tying into the concept of fuel diversity. So those are some of the kind of things that I would like to see happen. But certainly, not something that we're going to see in an upcoming auction. But with that, I'll turn it over to Donny and his thoughts on the upcoming auction. Donald R. Schneider: She said it pretty well, Julien. I don't have a lot to add. I mean, you kind of think of the plus and minus, if you will. On the plus side, if you're a generator, you've got the retirements that are out there. You've got the import limits. You've got the change that they made to DR. You at least have some suggestion about the arbitrage issues. Whether that gets done before the auction or not, who knows? But on the minus side of the ledger, you've got load forecast is down. You've got a lot of new generation in the queue. We'll have to see what happens there with that new generation. I think that's kind of the wildcard for the upcoming auction, if you will. And generally, I'd agree with Leila. It's possible to see this needle move a little bit in a favorable direction, but not nearly enough to sustain what the PJM needs from a reliability perspective going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Excellent. And just a clarification on Dan's last question there, if you don't mind. If you complete your review, could this drive a higher level of maintenance CapEx going forward? Does that change at all? James F. Pearson: I don't see when anything that's happened, Julien, this is Jim, that would drive any additional maintenance CapEx. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just looking at the fact book that you guys put out and Slide 151, I guess, the issue of free cash flow. It looks like it's substantially down. Now part of because of the lower income in the guidance. But there's also what appears to be a considerable higher level of collateral, I guess, that you guys expected. And this other item, other seems to have swung kind of negative. And I was just wondering if this is -- how much of this might be sort of an ongoing free cash flow situation that we should think about in 2015 and beyond versus sort of a polar vortex issue now? James F. Pearson: Paul, this is Jim. I would say you hit it right. A big driver of that is the earnings that are down. So I would say that's probably associated with at least... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : It looks like $100 million. The rest of it -- almost $400 million, it looks like, could be... James F. Pearson: I would say there's about $350 million there. We had -- in the first quarter, our collateral, it was up $419 million over the first quarter of last year. We did get some of that collateral returned to us when PJM reset their collateral requirements. We did get about $275 million back. So my expectation is collateral may be somewhat higher for a period of time, but not to the extent we have it right now. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And that other item that looked like it was almost $250 million swing almost, what is that? And does that continue? James F. Pearson: What's the other item you're looking at? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Well, just when we look at cash before other items, you've got high drags on sales, collateral, then other. And other seems like it's $194 million negative now, whereas last year -- I mean, excuse me, last numbers you guys gave was a positive $50 million. So I'm just wondering what's that, and does it continue? I mean, how do we think about 2015, I guess, and going forward in terms of what... James F. Pearson: I wouldn't -- that's a working capital item, Paul, so I would not expect that to continue like that. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Can you tell us what it was? Or I can follow up offline. James F. Pearson: You can follow up offline. Irene M. Prezelj: Paul, will you give me a call after the conference call, and we'll run that to ground for you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay, fine. And then just in terms of SB 310, there have been some news reports about some changes and amendments to it, perhaps. And I'm just wondering what you guys think about those potential amendments and what you think the outlook for getting this thing done is, and if you could just address that a little bit. Leila L. Vespoli: Paul, this is Leila. That is something that changes almost hourly. I do think they are posed to do something. I do think you're right in the sense that the different parties are looking at that and putting forward different compromise proposals as we go along. I can't say that I have a perfect crystal ball as to what's going to come out the other end. But I think, directionally, they are probably going to put forward something that is very positive. I don't think it will look like exactly what has been originally contained in the legislation. But I think from a perspective of saving customers' money in terms of energy efficiency requirements, I think it will come out positive. And I think, hopefully, they're slated to do something, yes, this week in the Senate. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I just wanted to talk about 2015 EBITDA for the competitive operations. And we've obviously seen a fairly large runup in power prices. To what extent does that factor in? I honestly would have thought perhaps EBITDA would be a bit higher, given the runup. Can you maybe talk through how the change in commodity prices impacts that 2015 EBITDA? James F. Pearson: At this point, Stephen, we have not updated our 2015 EBITDA for the open positions we have right now. So if those open positions are filled at a higher energy price, as we're seeing, then you could see that being driven up. But I'll leave Leila to give you some more color on that. Leila L. Vespoli: Actually, Stephen, I think, right now, with respect to our current sales levels in 2015, roughly sold the 56 million. If you were to not sell anything further going into it, just sell it at the current forward market prices, I think we would be within that range of EBITDA. So I think, right now, although we -- obviously, that's something we're going to continue to examine as we go forward, I think we are comfortably within the range and are -- as I said, continue to look at it as we go forward. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. But -- not to press on this too much, but since the last update, I mean, we've seen a very large move in commodity prices. I guess I would have expected that, given that you do have a fair amount of open position there, that the EBITDA would be higher. Are there other offsets or other things we should be thinking about? Leila L. Vespoli: I think one of the things you need to think about is the sustainability of the pricing going forward. That's something that we continue to look at. And as Tony mentioned, as we go forward, we're going to be looking at a different mixture of things, potentially. So again, that's something that we will continue to evaluate as we go forward. But right now, we feel comfortable kind of within that range as currently shown. Donald R. Schneider: Yes. I think, Stephen, just to add to that. This is Donny. If you think about where we're at today, Leila mentioned, for 2015, we've sold about 56 terawatt-hours. If you use -- we've given you a range on generation, but -- 75 to 80. If you just pick 76 as our generation, that would say that against our generation, we're about 20 terawatt-hours open. The market's moved kind of roughly about $6 for cal year '15, so you're at about $120 million, and I think our range was right at about $100 million. So what we're saying is things are looking better, obviously, from a wholesale perspective. We've got a nice open position. We haven't quite figured out where we're going with retail sales, so to speak. So just a lot of things in flux there that kind of boil down, and we'll probably be updating that later this year. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. I see. So there has been -- the move upward, that does help you achieve that and helps you feel better about where you might be in that range, it sounds like. Donald R. Schneider: Yes. No question, the upward movement in the market is always desirable. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : My -- not to beat a dead horse, but just to follow up with -- along the lines of the last question. Leila, I just want to make sure I heard correctly, you said that you've sold 56 terawatt hours -- or committed to sell 56 in '15 and committed to sell 32 in '16? Leila L. Vespoli: Correct. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And one would presume, given that power prices are up, that your plants would dispatch more. So you've given a range of generation output of 75 to 80 in both those years. Shouldn't I presume that you'd be closer to 80, as with prices up and volatility up, you'd probably run more? Because if I do -- if I run the deltas on power prices from the end of the year, I actually come up with more like a little over $200 million in incremental EBITDA in '15 on 24 terawatt-hour delta. So in order for that -- in order for you to not be above the last range, something would have had to have changed on the negative side in your P&L. Leila L. Vespoli: Greg, I think your first comment was fair, but I'm going to turn it over to Donny to address the latter piece. Donald R. Schneider: Yes. No, Greg, I think you're directionally correct. There's nothing that's changed in the P&L that would create downward pressure for '15. We are still evaluating where we want to be with retail sales, how we might want to play the wholesale market, for example. So that's really what's driving the fact that we haven't updated that range. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then all things equal in '16, you are long a little less than 50 terawatt-hours today, correct? Donald R. Schneider: Yes. With the 32 that's under contract, and you can plan on us generating somewhere, again, in the 75 to 80 terawatt-hours. That will leave you about -- just short of 50 terawatt hours open. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. At what point do you think you guys will be ready to give us some sort of a mark-to-market or sensitivity analysis on your position as commodity markets do change? Leila L. Vespoli: Greg, that's something that we're working on, and we should be in position to do in some future call. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Naz Comuala [ph] with Fidelity Investments. Unknown Analyst : I just had a question for you. I wanted to ask about coal piles and if you had any deliverability issues, and just if you could speak to that going into the summer. Anthony J. Alexander: Okay. I think our stockpiles are about 24, 25 days right now. We would typically have about 30. So my sense is we probably had some -- experienced some issues this winter, but I wouldn't classify them as significant or overall substantial, the type of things that we typically see, although this winter was a little more challenging on the Ohio river than normal. So we're pretty comfortable with where our inventories are at and our ability to continue to build those as we move into the summer to then have adequate inventories as we move into next winter. Unknown Analyst : Okay. Have you had to burn any gas in order to keep your coal piles at a certain level, or it's all been normal on that front? Anthony J. Alexander: It's all been normal on the front. James F. Pearson: This is Jim. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. For those of you who are still in the queue to ask a question, a member of the IR department will reach out to you. Our 3 core businesses, distribution, transmission and competitive energy services, provide us with the flexibility to capture value for our investors. Our first quarter results in our distribution and transmission businesses were within our expectations, and we are encouraged by continued signs of a more substantial economic recovery in our service area. And we will continue working to change the rules, policies and practices that currently create both negative reliability and price impacts in competitive markets, and we have taken action to mitigate the impact of current market conditions. We appreciate your continued support, and we remain committed to providing long-term value and sustainable growth. Thank you. Anthony J. Alexander: Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

Now I will turn the call over to Tony Alexander. Anthony Alexander : Thanks, Meghan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Since our last earnings call, we have made significant progress on the plans we have outlined to execute a regulated growth strategy, implement additional cost reductions and further reduce risk in our competitive business. We have several positive developments to discuss today, including the two rate filings in our distribution business that were announced yesterday and a shift in our competitive sales strategy as well as progress report on the transmission growth initiatives that are well underway. We have a lot of ground to cover today, so let\u2019s get started. I\u2019ll begin by taking a few minutes to discuss key developments in our transmission business. As you know, our energizing the Future transmission expansion program is designed to modernize our grid, reinforce the current system in light of expected plant deactivations and handle load growth primarily related to shale gas development. This year alone, we are on course to complete $1.3 billion in investments, spanning more than 1,300 projects. These include replacing equipment with advanced technology, reinforcing substation facilities with advanced surveillance and security technologies and rebuilding 234 miles of transmission line. In addition to these projects, we are on track to build a new 138 kV substation near Clarksburg, West Virginia and an 18-mile connecting project to support load growth in that area. We have also completed more than one-third of the nearly 100 projects associated with plant deactivations. These include the Eastlake 4 and 5 synchronous condensers, a new 345 kV to 138 kV substation and a 59-mile 345 line in Northwest Ohio. Currently, we have nearly 1,500 workers engaged to support the engineering, procurement and construction of these Energizing the Future initiatives. Our management processors are in place to sustain the growth targets we\u2019ve previously identified as well as our current in plan construction efforts. On the distribution side of the business, while Leila will fill in the details, we filed applications for all of our Pennsylvania utilities, seeking an increase in annual revenues of approximately $416 million. This increase would place our average rates for distribution service in Pennsylvania about on par with the average rates charged by other major Pennsylvania utilities. We also filed a new electric security plan for our Ohio utilities, which we\u2019re calling Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress. The filing proposes the continuation of many of the terms of the current ESP but also includes an economic stability program that will help protect customers from retail volatility and price increases that result from rising energy and capacity prices in future years. This program would also help ensure the continued investment in and operation of significant base load assets located primarily in Ohio. These plants provide fuel diversity as well as substantial employment, tax and economic benefits. We now have pending applications in New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio which is consistent with our focus on regulated operations and should better position these companies to address the ongoing challenges of upgrading, modernizing and maintaining adequate and reliable electric service. Let\u2019s move to a discussion about competitive markets which we believe are clearly in transition and how we are proactively responding by adapting our operations to create value. While we have experienced a relatively stable and predictable wholesale market for the past several years, we believe that a fundamental change in markets is underway as available generation is being reduced due to environmental rules and competitive market to rely more heavily on natural gas and other less reliable resources. We saw the first evidence of this last year during hotter weather in September at the beginning of the plant outage season. Then this past winter\u2019s polar vortex highlighted again the issues the markets will likely face as a fleet of assets to provide a central electric service is fundamentally changed. And when you couple those changes with a market construct that is eroding the price stability necessary to offer retail customers predictable prices, the risk associated with serving retail loads will rise. As a result, we are taking action to better position the company\u2019s competitive operations and generation fleet going forward. This is consistent with our expectations that wholesale energy prices generally will be more volatile and the current forwards do not fully reflect the change in market fundamentals. While Leila will describe our competitive strategy in more detail, key accents include reducing our exposure to weather sensitive retail loads and maintaining a more open position to take advantage of market upsides and to provide our own reserve margins since the wholesale markets can no longer be relied upon to assure reasonable pricing. We are in a good position to do this since our current retail book naturally opens as contracts expire and is also aligned with the reduction in available capacity as a result of environmental shutdowns. More specifically, we intend to exit the medium commercial and industrial or MCI and mass market retail channels as existing contracts expire, but we will continue to serve strategic large industrial and commercial customers as well as our governmental aggregation in polar channels as appropriate. Our generation in hedging strategy including maintaining an open position of 10 to 20 terawatt hours annually is focused on reducing overall risk in our competitive operations while maximizing margins, EBITDA and creating value. With respect to our generating assets, we have an exceptional fleet with the size and scope that provides flexibility to adapt to current and expected market conditions and environmental mandates. I\u2019ll take a few minutes now to discuss these issues and opportunities within our fleet. With regard to the EPA\u2019s proposal issued in June, the regulating CO2 emissions from existing electric generating units, we continue to analyze and review the proposal with particular interest in the treatment of nuclear units. The current proposal allows only 6% of existing nuclear generation to counter towards the reduction targets. However, I can assure you that each EPA will be receiving significant comments on this point. We will continue to monitor new details that emerge as the regulatory process evolves particularly with regard to how our state regulators design their implementation plan. At this point, it\u2019s too soon to say what if any changes would be required at our coal fire plants. However, we are already on track to achieve a 25% reduction below 2005 levels and CO2 emission by 2015 as a result of plant retirements and investments in plant efficiencies we\u2019ve already made. So how these rules ultimately are implemented and whether they are focused on CO2 emissions or driving other aspects of energy policy or largely determine what if anything we will need to do. With respect to other environmental mandates, we have negotiated with PJM to continue operating Eastlake units one through three and Lake Shore 18 following the expiration of reliability-must-run or RMR agreements in September. We will now be in a position to operate these units until April 15, 2015 when the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule impose a stringent emission reductions. During the post RMR period, these units will be operated based on market conditions and we will be responsible for all costs and receive all revenues. Having these units available through the winter should help to provide an additional hedge against extreme weather events next year. We have also taken yet another look at how we can reduce our cost for mass compliance. Through our performance testing, equipment assessment and inspections, we have identified several additional opportunities for cost control and we now expect our total spend for mass compliance to be approximately $370 million which is down from our most recent estimate of $465 million. The spending is about evenly split between competitive and regulated units. Turning to other generate matters, the PJM capacity auction for 2017 and 2018 which was held in May produced stronger results than last year. However, the prices were still not where they need to be to sufficiently support the type of generation resources needed to assure a reliable and diverse supply or essential electric service. More specifically as to our company, our 2,400 megawatt, Bruce Mansfield plant, which is the largest super critical base load coal fire plant in Pennsylvania is fully equipped with scrubbers, SCRs and cooling towers and is critical to providing reliable electric service in ATSI, did not clear in the most recent auction and only partially cleared in last year\u2019s auction. As a result, while we will continue to operate and maintain the Mansfield plant, we have decided to minimize capital expenditures at this site until we get the results from the incremental auction in September of this year and perhaps until after the PJM auction in 2015 or the 2018-2019 period. It would take approximately two years to complete the new water treatment upgrades that are necessary for continued operation after the little blue run coal [ph] facility closures on December 31, 2016. If market conditions are unfavorable, we are prepared to delay these projects, pushing out the timing of the capital expenditures and possibly impacting the nature and timing of the outage. We will continue to provide updates on Mansfield. However, at this point, our current assumptions include the cost associated with the incremental upgrades in the 2015 to 2017 period of approximately $200 million. If the project is delayed, these costs will move to later periods. And I\u2019d note that we do not anticipate a material impact on EBITDA as a result of these potential actions. Finally, at Beaver Valley, we are moving the unit two reactor head and steam generator replacement outage to 2020 from 2017. This change, which will not impact the safe operation of the plant, is possible given the condition of the facility. Our actions with respect to MATS spending and delaying capital spending at Beaver Valley are a continuation of our cost control measures. The total capital savings from the MATS spending reduction, the deferral at Beaver Valley and other fleet-wide capital reductions is approximately $425 million over the next several years. We believe these actions will not only put us in a position to be cash flow positive at our competitive business during the 2015 to 2018 periods, but also put our competitive business in a much stronger position to face current market conditions. This morning, we reaffirmed our full year 2014 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share reflecting our expectations for the remainder of the year. We also provided incremental disclosures for our competitive operations in our fact book including the amount of capacity clearing in the annual PJM auctions as well as other details to support your efforts to model this part of our business. We anticipate that this additional transparency will support proper valuation of our competitive operations going forward. Finally, on the topic of proper valuations, we recognize that the market is assigning a discount that is likely due to a number of factors, some of which are within our control and some not. As we begin to get more clarity on external drivers, such as the ongoing REIT case in New Jersey for example and communicate our strategy as we transform the company, we anticipate this will provide better visibility into our growth prospects for the future particularly those related to our regulated utility and transmission operations. Thank you for your support. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Leila. Leila Vespoli : Thanks, Tony and good afternoon everyone. Let\u2019s start with a deeper dive into our competitive generation strategy. The strategy we are laying out today is straightforward. We will pursue the effective hedging of the majority of our generation resources with reduced risk, at the highest possible margins possible while leaving a portion of generation available to capture market opportunities. We have already taken action to mitigate risks and create length in our portfolio by purchasing additional power and auctions during peak period as well as by buying outage insurance this summer, all of which we spoke about at our last earnings call. Since then, we have allowed some attrition or our customer base and returned selected customers to polar service. Going forward, we intend to serve all existing customers through their contract term. But as Tony outlined, we will eliminate our selling and renewal efforts in MCI and mass market channel and to certain LCI customers. We plan to maintain our sales efforts and government aggregation primarily in Ohio through a polar load and focus on selective, strategic sales to LCI customers. Looking at each of those channels, we intend to continue sales to government aggregation communities primarily when contract prices move with the market at the percent of the price to compare. These sales also have relatively low acquisition cost and margins are generally attractive. With the polar channel, we have virtually no acquisition cost. We have the flexibility to make decisions at the time of each of auction as to the value of the loan. We also plan to continue selling to strategic large commercial and industrial customers where we have a significant relationship or where the customer had a very high load factor that is not weather sensitive. Basically, these customers represent a wholesale type load, but include a modest retail margin. This menu of auctions provides us with considerable flexibility as we look to establish our hedging strategy. And we are in a strong position given the hedges we already have in place for both 2015 and 2016 with about 54 terawatt hours and 28 terawatt hours committed respectively. These include our currently committed direct LCI, MCI and mass market sales book which tapers off through 2018, but with a significant drop staring in mid 2015. As well as the polar and government aggregation sales, a portion of which extends for 2019. We expect that our level of sales to large commercial and industrial customers, polar and government aggregation would sell in at about 10 to 45 terawatt hours annually. Given our current committed, we expect to be in that range beginning in June 2015 and for the subsequent 12 month-period. In additions, we expect to use hotel sales to hedge our generation and potentially utility purchase power agreement. We view all these auctions as a hedging tool chest with considerable flexibility to adjust as market conditions dictate. The charges associated with our decision to exit certain channels were $0.07 per share in the second quarter with an expected ongoing savings of about $90 million annually. Going forward, we may cover a portion of our sales commitment with purchased powers in various amounts based on the season, fleet operational plan and other considerations and amounts to be determined as appropriate. But we expect purchased power to be minimal going forward. Our competitive generation fleet can generally produce between 75 and 80 terawatt hours per year with up to 5 terawatt hours of additional generation available from wind, solar and our OVEC entitlement. Our updated EBITDA estimate for 2015 is in the range of $900 million to $1 billion and assumes a market forward power prices of just under $40 a megawatt hour as of mid-July. In our fact lore [ph] which is available on our website, you will see that we have slipped our close and open position which will enable updating the open position on a mark-to-market basis going forward each quarter. In addition, we are also providing sensitivities with $1 a megawatt hour change in market prices changing 2015 EBITDA at roughly $28 million. I\u2019d also like to note that we expect to provide at least 2016 EBITDA guidance at the annual EEI conference in order to provide longer-term transparency with respect to our competitive operations. As we transform our competitive operations, we will focus on leveraging market opportunities as they present themselves with a diligent focus on risk management. As you can see, our FES team has done a great deal of work over the past quarter to reevaluate sales target and identity opportunities for cost control so that we can best position of our competitive business going forward. At the same time, our regulatory team has also had a productive quarter. And I\u2019ll switch gears now to provide an update on current regulatory issue and the filings we made yesterday. Our Ohio ESP filing will provide electric service to our utility customers for a three-year term from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019. We have named this plan, Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress, as it provides numerous benefits that support reliable electric service, uplift our customers from volatility and retail price increases and encourages growth and development of the State\u2019s economy. A highlight of the plan is the Economic Stability Program which provides for rider to cover the cost associated with the proposed purchase power agreement between the Ohio utilities and FirstEnergy solutions. The proposed PPA would dedicate the output of Davis-Besse, SAMA and a portion of OVEC for approximately 3,200 megawatt or an average of approximately 23 terawatt hours annually beginning in June 2016 and running through May 2031. As designed, the utilities would sell this power into the market and net any revenues associated with these plants against cost, thereby serving as a type of rate stabilization mechanism protecting against volatility and retail price increases. Importantly, the Economic Stability Program will not impact the Ohio utilities competitive bid process and retail customers will still be able to choose an alternative retail supplier for power supply. Under Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress, base distribution rates would remain frozen throughout the term. A typical residential customer using 750 kilowatt hours of electricity per month could expect to pay an average of $3.50 more per month during the first full year of the Economic Stability Program. But as I\u2019ve described, customers would receive a credit on their electric bill if market revenues exceed costs as projected over time. The current ESP is widely considered a success in terms of its ability to produce competitively priced electricity for customers to remain with our utilities for generation focus [ph] as well as to create a level playing field among suppliers competing to serve retail customers to choose a shaft. It was broadly supported by diverse groups representing various customers and other interested parties. Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress builds on that successful platform. It will not change the amount of power procured through the auction progress or otherwise detract from the competitive retail markets in our region. Our Ohio utilities would continue to utilize competitively bid auctions to procure generation supply for our customers who don\u2019t choose an alternative retail supplier. In addition, Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress delivers significant benefits to the State of Ohio by retaining local jobs, protecting local tax revenue and promoting economic development. It benefits Ohio utility customers through the safeguards from volatility and potential retail price increases. And it benefits FES by providing a top base source of revenue for approximately 25% of its generation output. We have requested the decision respecting our plan by April 8, 2015, which we believe is adequate time for all interested parties to evaluate the proposal. This timeline also fits with our competitive generation hedging strategy and then it provides adequate time to redirect these megawatt hours to other available hedging opportunities should Ohio decline this opportunity. And provides adequate time for the polar auction for supplies starting June 1, 2016. In Pennsylvania, our four operating companies are seeking to increase base rates to ensure continued service reliability improvement for the 2 million customers they serve. Our Pennsylvania utilities have maintained stable rates for many years through strict cost control measures and careful planning. The last base distribution rate increase for all four companies was more than 20 years ago. If the proposed rate plans are adapted, customers will benefit directly through continued service reliability enhancement to the local distribution networks that deliver electricity to homes and businesses in our community. These enhancements build on our Energizing the Future transmission initiative which includes support for smart technologies and can help reduce frequency and duration of power outages. The filing request approval to increase operating revenues by approximately $152 million at Met-Ed, $120 million at Penelec, $28 million at Penn Power and $116 at West Penn Power based upon fully projected test years for the 12-month ended April 30, 2015. As a result, rate case request would increase average monthly customer bills by approximately 11.5% at Met-Ed, 8.6% at Penelec, 8.7% at Penn Power and 8.4% at West Penn Power, which in all cases is substantially below the rate of inflation since the last case for each company. We expect a decision with the Pennsylvania rate cases in April 2015 timeframe. We have provided more detailed summaries of both our Ohio and Pennsylvania filings in a letter to the investment community we issued yesterday after market close. With respect to other regulatory activity, in New Jersey, the Administrative Law Judge close the record on our base rate case of June 30th and we expect his recommendation later this quarter and anticipate APU action on our case in the fall. In Pennsylvania on June 5th, the PCE approved the amended smart meter deployment plan for our Pennsylvania companies allowing us to move forward with building the entire Penn Power smart meter system of 170,000 meters by the end of next year. We began installation last month. And finally, on May 23rd, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that FERC\u2019s requirement that RTO to pay LMP to demand response that participates in wholesale energy market encroaches on the State exclusive jurisdiction to regulate retail market. The court\u2019s decision was based on its finding that demand response is a retail product and therefore FERC does not have jurisdiction to regulate it in wholesale energy markets. The court\u2019s action in the case it takes an important step toward allowing wholesale energy market to begin functioning properly. On the same day as the court\u2019s decision and before the May 2014 capacity auction results were announced, we filed a complaint at FERC citing the court\u2019s decision, asking FERC to pull demand resources out of the May 2014 PJM capacity auction. The PJM capacity auction is a wholesale market, so the inclusion of demand response resources is inappropriate in light of the court\u2019s decision. Eliminating demand response as a compensated capacity resource would provide much needed uplift for essential physical generation and better allow the PJM capacity auction to work as originally intended. In fact, in an analysis published last month, the PJM market monitor found that removing demand response from the May 2014 capacity would increase the clearing price in RTO from $120 a megawatt a day to $282 a megawatt a day. I would like to thank you for your time. Clearly, it has been a very active and constructive quarter on both the competitive and regulatory front. And we will continue to position our competitive business for the future while ensuring the best possible regulatory environment for our company. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter. James Pearson : Thanks, Leila. As I discuss our financial results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report which was issued this morning as in available on our website. Our second quarter operating earnings of $0.49 per share were in line with our expectations. These results compared to second quarter 2013 operating earnings of $0.59 per share. While I will walk through the drivers of each of our business units in a minute, the major drivers included lower commodity margin at our competitive business and higher operating expense in our distribution business primarily due to increased maintenance and vegetation management cost. On a GAAP basis, second quarter earnings were $0.16 per basic share compared to a loss of $0.39 per basic share in the second quarter of 2013. The special items that make up the $0.32 difference between GAAP and operating earnings can be found on page 2 of the consolidated report. Let\u2019s turn to a review of the key drivers of operating earnings across each of our business segments starting with distribution. During the second quarter, operating earnings for our distribution business were $0.39 per share which compares to $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2013. The decrease is largely due to our enhanced focus on maintenance and vegetation management work in the second quarter of this year. These activities together with a 56-day outage at Fort Martin Unit 1 resulted in a $0.05 per share in operating expenses compared to the same period in 2013. Distribution operating earnings were also impacted by higher depreciation, pension expense and interest expenses compared to second quarter of 2013. The Harrison/Pleasants asset transfer increased earnings by $0.01 per share and a lower effective tax rate resulting from changes in state apportionment factors, increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Looking now at distribution deliveries, while operating earnings associated with deliveries were flat, the overall trend remains positive particularly regarding the continued steady improvement in our commercial and industrial sectors. Total distribution deliveries increased by 175,000 megawatt hours or less than 1% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Now looking at the mix of sales, milder temperatures resulted in a 2% decrease and deliveries through residential customers. Heating degree days were 6% lower than 2013 and 10% below normal. While cooling degree days were 7% below 2013 and 3% above normal. Adjusted for the impact of weather, residential sales decreased about 1%. Sales to commercial customers increased 1% overall and were up nearly 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. And sales to industrial customers were 2% higher than the second quarter of 2013 driven again by shale activity as well as increased production from the steel and automotive sectors. As we have discussed over the past several quarters, the overall trends particularly for commercial and industrial deliveries remain solid. In fact, over the past 12 months while weather adjusted residential sales have been essentially flat, commercial deliveries have increased 2% and sales to industrial customers are up nearly 3% reflecting four consecutive quarterly increases in each of those segments. The industrial pipeline remains promising particularly with respect to shale-related activity and we remain cautiously optimistic that growth in this sector will continue to accelerate over the next several years. Moving now toward transmission business, operating earnings were $0.15 per share which is a 25% increase compared $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was driven by higher transmission revenues resulting from revenue requirement increases at ATSI and Trailco following their annual rate filings that were effective in June as well as higher capitalized financing cost. Let\u2019s now turn to our competitive business. Operating earnings were $0.03 per share for the quarter, which compares to $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Operating earnings were impacted by a lower commodity margin, higher investment income and lower operating and maintenance cost. Commodity margin decreased operating earnings by $0.14 per share driven primarily by lower energy prices at the time the sales were committed and lower contract and wholesale sales volumes. While unit prices benefited from higher capacity rates, they also reflect the adverse impact of generally lower energy prices. You will recall that market power prices fell significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. Prior to the drop in prices, our 2014 sales book was 30% committed while 2013 committed sales were 60% committed. Therefore, more of our 2014 sales were committee at lower energy prices as compared to 2013. Our overall retail customer count decreased 100,000 to 2.6 million since June 30, 2013 and total channel sales decreased 1.6 million megawatt hours or 6%. We were already taking steps to be more selective in our sales to the large and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers during the second quarter. And this strategy resulted in a 16% decrease in those channels compared to the same period in 2013. Our total customer count in the LCI, MCI and mass market channels will continue to decrease as we implement the strategy Leila and Tony discussed earlier. Total generating output from ongoing units decreased 1 million megawatt hours. This was driven by outages and derates at our super critical coal units during the quarter which offset higher generation at our nuclear fleet primarily due to fewer forced outage days compared to the second quarter of 2013. Fuel and purchased power cost were lower in the quarter and commodity margin also benefitted from higher PJM capacity revenues, net financial sales and purchases and lower MISO and PJM transmission expense. Additionally, O&M cost increased earnings by $0.03 per share primarily related to the lower retail and marketing related expense partially offset by higher outage cost at our nuclear and fossil plants. Overall, we remain pleased for the continued solid performance of our transmission and distribution businesses during the second quarter and first half of the year. And we believe the strategies we have put in place in all three of our businesses will lead to strong, stable returns going forward. As always, we will continue to focus on our core businesses with a commitment to operational excellence, financial discipline and predictable and sustainable growth opportunities. Now, I will open up the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi, good afternoon. Anthony Alexander : Hello, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi. Just on the transition of the portfolio, the retail portfolio, can you give us a sense of how quickly you think you\u2019ll arrive at sort of the optimal shape because obviously the sales ratchet down but you\u2019re saying you want to basically be out of MCI and mass market. So when the sort of FirstEnergy, new FirstEnergy retail book \u2013 when do we see that book? Donald Schneider : Jonathan, this is Donny. You probably haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the fact book yet, but when you get a chance if you look at Slide 102, it will show a buy channel as those sales turn them out. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, so we can \u2013 so there\u2019s a slide in that. I haven\u2019t seen that, you\u2019re right. So there\u2019s a slide in there which will kind of answer my question. Donald Schneider : Yes, it\u2019s a good slide. It will show channel by channel, so you\u2019ll be able to see the MCI and the LCI, et cetera. Kind of generally speaking, maybe we\u2019ll probably hit our target volumes about first quarter of second quarter of \u201816. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then is it correct that given what you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going into this coming winter that you are still probably short in the same amount that you were going into last winter, but you purchased protection. Do I understand that correctly? Donald Schneider : No, not at all, Jonathan. Again, I apologize that you haven\u2019t had the chance to look at the fact book, but you\u2019ll see a real good slide on Slide 101 that shows our length. We\u2019re actually about 500 megawatts long going into the winter. And that excludes our peaking capacity. So the simple cycle CTs and the oil CTs would lie on top of the 500 megawatt that we\u2019re already long. So we\u2019re in pretty good shape for the winter. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : So I see, that one\u2019s like \u2013 that\u2019s a monthly look rather than an aggregate annual look? Donald Schneider : Yes, that\u2019s month by month. And it reflects any outages and whatnot to fit our plan. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : I see that. Very helpful. On a slightly different topic that I did \u2013 I think I had the number correctly that you thought you would have in aggregate $425 million capital savings over the next several years. Anthony Alexander : Yes, that\u2019s basically 2015 to 2018. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Is that savings of the money that you\u2019re just not going to spend because you found ways not to spend it or is this some of it saving and some of it deferral. Anthony Alexander : Well, some of it obviously is deferral especially that related to the Beaver Valley Steam Generator and replacement project. Now that will move into the \u2013 probably a little probably a little in \u201818, more in \u201819 and 2020 when the project is that fully undertaken. The MATS savings are in fact real. They\u2019re not moved around and much of it depends on what the nature of the other capital investments are. Some will be as you call permanent, some will be just moved depending on when outages are scheduled. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : How would the $425 million bread down between permanent and deferrals roughly? Anthony Alexander : Well, one of the largest portions of the $425 million would be the Beaver Valley movement. And I think that was about $270 million of the $425 million. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. Thank you, Tony. And if I could just one final thing, did I hear right, you said, you would expect it to give at 2016 EBITDA guidance for the EI [ph]. Is the implication that you might go out further? Anthony Alexander : I think that\u2019s the only way you can think about it. But right now \u2013 Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : No, I just want to make sure I heard that right. Anthony Alexander : In focus [ph], I\u2019m trying to give you at least \u201816. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Anthony Alexander : Okay. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : And then can you give us any sense at all of what the \u2013 I think you talked about the implication for residential customer would be of the ESP of $3.50 for a month which I guess one could calculate a net revenue uplift, but then there\u2019s obviously commercial and industrial as well. How does the ESP change your look? Can you give us any aggregate sense of that? Leila Vespoli : I do not have that really handy. It would be a kilowatt an hour charge, so over an average customer\u2019s usage. But I really can get that, but I don\u2019t have that readily hand now. I\u2019m sorry, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : All right. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry for too many questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies, please proceed with your question. Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies: Hi. Thank you very much. I was hoping that we could get you to elaborate a little bit on the sale of the generation from FES to the regulated companies. For instance, when we think about the revenue requirements, should we tie to sort of a book value number for those assets. And what would be the book value? Leila Vespoli : So the way to think about it is kind of \u2013 if you go back in time, a regulated rate of return on rate base and O&M, so how one would have traditionally done it in Ohio. And that then is compared to what the market produces and net difference is either a credit of charge to customers. And that information is contained in the filing, although, I believe under confidentially. Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies: Do you have like a book value number for those megawatts? Leila Vespoli : No. Again, it\u2019s \u2013 if you think about it in terms of evidence in the case, it is evidence in the case but it is under confidentially agreement. Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. And then in terms of the customers that are opting for this, do you need enough customers to sign up for all the generation output of these units in order for all of this to qualify? Or would this amount of generation be dedicated irrespective of the customer sign up? Leila Vespoli : Okay. So it is a non-bypassable charge. So if you think of it, what\u2019s actually happening is the FES side of the house is selling all the output from these three plants to the utilities. The utilities are taking the output and selling it into the marketplace. They are paying the competitive side of the house, the cost base kind of the traditional rate base kind of return. And they are taking the money they get from the marketplace again netting it against what they paid the FES side of the house and would either be a charge or credit to customers. So the power itself is not actually going to serve customers directly. It is acting as a rate stabilization mechanism. And over the 15-year term, it is predicted to produce savings for customers at $2 billion or $800 million net present value. So over the 15-year term, it will be a huge savings to customers. And if you think about it from a competitive standpoint for something in Ohio, Ohio looks to be a competitive state. It does not at all harm competition in Ohio because the Ohio polar auctions will go forward just as they had in the past. They will procure exactly the same amount of power and suppliers can compete for customers in the same exact way they\u2019ve competed for them in the past. So again, I don\u2019t believe it is going to affect competition or ability of suppliers to compete either retail or at the wholesale polar level, but it is giving customers $2 billion and stability going forward. Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies: And then can you remind us who are the key parties that you would look to \u2013 if you were to try and settle in Ohio, who are the key parties that you would need in the settlement? Leila Vespoli : So in the past, we have been very successful in getting quite diverse support around our settlements. Industrial customers are generally the most knowledgeable about markets and have been the ones in the past who have been interested in this kind of thing. So we\u2019ll be looking to them. Staff in the past had something \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s entirely similar to what we were putting on the table with respect to AP. I think there\u2019s very significant differences. What we have in our Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress and in particular the economic stability program that is very different from that which is in the AP case for one thing, the Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress deals with the economic vitality of the state, the jobs, the taxes in Ohio, these were plants that were originally built to serve Ohio customers. And if market revenues didn\u2019t prove to be sufficient to keep these plants around, the transmission that would be needed to compensate for that would especially be allocated to the after loan [ph]. So it\u2019s something that needs to be thought of in terms of the overall dynamic. So I think while I mentioned the staff and they might have had some concerns about remotely similar kind of agreements in the past, I think we bring something different here and I would look to them as a settling partly. Retail suppliers is another entity. And again, since I don\u2019t believe this affects them, I would be hopeful that we could have positive discussion with them and then obviously, the Office of Consumers Counsel. Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. And my last question is, can you update us on the status of the nuclear sound leasebacks and are you including in your capital requirements a potential buyout of the nuclear leases when they come to you? James Pearson : Yes, Paul, this is Jim. We\u2019ve reached agreement with a majority of our lessors. I think we only have 50 megawatts that we have not reached an agreement on. We have buyback of the significant portion of that already, so I think we only have about 150 megawatts left to repurchase. So we do have some anticipated capital outflow in the 2016-\u201917 timeframe for those outstanding megawatts. Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies: Thank you very much. James Pearson : Okay, thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Thank you very much. I was wondering if you might take us through the drop in guidance for GAAP earnings and the increase in excluded items from the operating earnings. James Pearson : Yes, Hugh, this is Jim. Our GAAP earnings, it changed by about $0.34 and it was made up of first plant deactivation. That was $0.12 and that mostly is a contract termination, a fuel contract termination. Our retail repositioning, that\u2019s about $0.11 which you saw some of that already incurred this quarter. $0.10 on mark-to-market which is just as positions expiring at this point and then we had $0.01 for trust impairments. So that\u2019s what made up the change in our GAAP earnings of $0.34. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: And could you explain perhaps the plant deactivation? I didn\u2019t quite catch that. So you had a fuel contract that\u2019s made and that caused you to deactivate a plant or \u2013? James Pearson : Oh no, I\u2019m sorry. That was just the termination of a fuel contract and it kind of relates to not eating as much of our fuel that we had under contract. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Understood. Because of prior deactivations, you no longer needed the supply? James Pearson : That\u2019s correct. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Right, okay. And then I also would like if you wouldn\u2019t mind just a quick clarification of the comments around the Mansfield plant. I got a little bit confused there. I understood that the plant will continue to operate but that your minimized CapEx and in particular, you\u2019re going to defer a water treatment upgrade but that\u2019s not one of these do or die CapEx projects that would be required for continued operation or did I get that wrong? Anthony Alexander : I think \u2013 Hugh, this is Tony. Let me kind of walk you through that. With respect to Mansfield, we\u2019re going to continue making the max spend that\u2019s required for continued operation of that plant. That\u2019s part of the game plan. At Mansfield, however, Mansfield needs a new water treatment facility. It\u2019s about a $200 million facility. It will take about two years to construct that. Because the Mansfield ash disposal site closes on December 31, 2016, essentially that construction project must start no later than January 1, 2015 in order to assure us that we will have it available for continued operation of the plant beyond January 1, 2017. So if we delay that expenditure, it will require us to time differently how we take the Mansfield unit down and when we take it down to accomplish what needs to be done from a water treatment standpoint. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Okay. But you would still be operating \u2013 Anthony Alexander : Does that help you? Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Yes, I believe it does. But you \u2013 Anthony Alexander : It cannot operate after December 31, 2016. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Cannot operate but it \u2013 Anthony Alexander : Cannot operate without the water treatment facilities. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Got it, okay, great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking \u2013 Anthony Alexander : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : How are you doing? Anthony Alexander : Good. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Just really quickly on the hedge change, it sounds like it was a $90 million benefit that you guys saw annually from that. Could you just elaborate a little bit more about what that is? Is that income, is that \u2013 did I get it right? James Pearson : Yes, Paul, yes, you got that right. That would be income. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Is that pretax or after tax? And when was that part \u2013 Anthony Alexander : Those are expenses. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, those are \u2013 Anthony Alexander : And what we\u2019re really looking at, Paul, that would be reductions in agent fees, personnel, overall operating costs because you\u2019re not running a retail operation any longer at the same extent that we are today. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : And when would that show up or to show up? Anthony Alexander : Probably in the latter part of this year. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Anthony Alexander : As we wind down the operations, it will smooth out over time to \u2013 Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Is there \u2013 Anthony Alexander : So we\u2019ll see some of it this year, most of it next year. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Is there any decrease in margin because you guys are taking less risk it looks like instead of derisking the hedging. Is that correct? I mean, is there any other offset that we should think about that or \u2013 I mean you can get back \u2013 I\u2019ll just follow up with you guys afterwards. The second one that I really have for you guys is, is as you know, there\u2019s this thing called the Edgar principle when we have to deal with affiliated transactions. I know you guys know a lot more about it than I do. Does it apply to you, do you think in this case in the Ohio \u2013 the Power Ohio case? And if not, why not and if so, how do you solve it for it I guess? Leila Vespoli : So we have a market base rate authority and we believe that the PPA is covered under that. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : So as a result of long term contract would be seen as a market transaction, is that what you mean, I\u2019m sorry? Leila Vespoli : That is correct. So we would not need to be filing at FERC, so we would not have that review process occur. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, so FERC would not be reviewing this under Edgar. Leila Vespoli : Right. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then just finally, with the $140 million decrease in FFO, it seems for 2014, we saw a decrease in the first quarter as well. Any trend there or is that just noise or what have you? James Pearson : Paul, this is Jim. That decrease in FFO, that was attributable that fuel supply contract I talked about that we terminated. And the other portion was associated with the expenditures for our retail repositioning. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, thanks so much. James Pearson : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question will come from the line of Greg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Greg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes, thanks very much. Thank you for all the information. On Slide 106. Anthony Alexander : Okay, Greg. Now we\u2019ll all be flipping pages there. Greg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital : Within the hedged EBITDA, the capacity expense is $150 million higher than the revenue. How much of that is offset in \u201816 if it\u2019s possible to say? Donald Schneider : Greg, this is Donny. I think the best way to think about capacity revenue and capacity expense as it\u2019s laid out here is you really have to think about them as completely separate transactions almost. The capacity revenue that we get is a result of bidding our units into the BRAs and into the incremental auctions. We would get that capacity revenue regardless of what we\u2019re doing on the retail side. The capacity expense on the other hand is tied directly to what we do on the retail side. And the revenue that offsets that capacity expense is built into our retail rates. Greg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thank you. James Pearson : Okay, Greg, thank you. I\u2019d like thank everyone for joining us on the call today. If we didn\u2019t get to you in the Q&A, please call our IR department and we\u2019d be happy to get back with you. As you heard today, we\u2019re making substantial progress towards our long-term regulated growth strategy in our transmission business. Our Energizing the Future transmission investment initiative is well underway and we are on track to complete the investments we have endebtified [ph] this year while laying the groundwork for future construction efforts. In our distribution business, we now have active rate cases in four states including our proposed plan in Ohio that would help protect customers in the State from both potential market volatility and retail price increases. At the same time in our competitive business, we are taking further steps designed to reduce overall risk while retaining the flexibility to capture future market opportunities. And we intend to continue to reduce our overall cost structure over the next several years. We believe that positive developments we discussed today together with our strong commitment to success, will help us provide long-term value and predictable, sustainable growth to our investors. Again, we appreciate your continued support. Thanks for joining in today. Anthony Alexander : Thanks everyone. Leila Vespoli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at time and thank you for your participation.",

Now I will turn the call over to Tony Alexander. Tony Alexander : Thanks, Meghan, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, we will provide an update on the important initiatives that are shaping our company's future. Since our last earnings call in August, we have continued to build positive momentum in our regulated businesses and limit risk at our competitive operations. And at the same time, we are starting to see real progress as a result of our efforts to advocate for a competitive market that supports price stability and reliability. I will start with the review of development across our business, including some of the early and encouraging signs of reforms in the regional competitive markets. Then Chuck will join us with an update on the distribution business and our transmission investments. Leila will then discuss the status of the rate cases at our utilities, the ATSI filing that we made last week and other regulatory matters, as well as an update on the changes we have put in place in our competitive business. Finally, Jim will review our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Okay. Let's get started. I'll start with a look back at events that have shaped this year so for. We believe 2014 will be remembered as a pivotal period for both our company and for the competitive environment in our region. The stage was set with the unusually warm temperatures in our region in September 2013, which strained the regional grid. With the start of the next year the same region was impacted by the polar vortex and subsequent severe weather events throughout the winter. These episodes of increased demand, revealed weaknesses in the regions power supply and resulted in nearly 100 emergency actions, interruptions of service to customers and severe spikes in wholesale power prices. We reacted quickly to the deterioration in market conditions, reassessing our sales strategy and setting a new course for our competitive business, based on the new market dynamics. As you know we took a series of significant steps, reduced our exposure to weather sensitive retail loads and to maintain a more open position to take advantage of market upside opportunities. At the same time, we have been working to support changes that can help prevent similar or even more disastrous stress on the electric grid in the future. And it is becoming evident that the weather events are serving as a catalyst for a number of very important reforms that will not -- that we not only endorse, but view as critical to stabilizing the wholesale markets in this region. One such reform is PJM\u2019s capacity performance proposal. This is a positive step and truly recognizing the role of baseload generation with firm fuel, the grid stability and reliability. As Leila will explain, work on this proposal is continuing, but our belief is that this could have a very positive effect on the company and the grid. The future role of demand response also continues to be in play in PJM. The full panel of the DC Circuit recently declined to rehear the ruling that FERC does not have jurisdiction to regulate demand response in wholesale markets. As I'm sure you all know, FERC has signaled its intent to appeal that ruling to the United States Supreme Court. Again, Leila will discuss the demand response issue. However, a favorable resolution of this issue will be positive to the company, the markets and the grid. The increase focus around market reform issues seems to signify the start of a meaningful shift in the competitive business environment after years of very challenging conditions. We remained optimistic that this is only the beginning and we will continue to advocate for a workable solution that can ensure adequate revenues, revenues for operators of baseload generation, while also recognizing that fuel diversity and maintaining the right mix of assets are essential to reliability of our region's electric system. Turning now to other developments across our company, starting with generation. Last week, we reached an agreement in principle to purchase the remaining lesser equity interest in the nuclear sale leaseback of Perry Unit 1 representing approximately 55 megawatts. Consistent with our strategy to take these future obligations off the table, upon the completion of this purchase, we will have either purchased or have binding agreements for the purchase of all the ownership interest in connection with the nuclear sale leasebacks at Perry and Beaver Valley. In August, we told you that we decided to minimize capital expenditures at our 2,400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield plant, while we evaluate the strength of competitive markets. Although, the results from the September 2016, 2017 incremental auction were stronger, Mansfield did not clear. While we continued to operate and maintain the plant, we will consider the impact of the market reforms currently being considered, as well as the results of the May 2015 PJM auction for the 2018, \u201919 period in our decision about the timing of the dewatering facility. That is required to continue the plants operation after December 31, 2016. As we look towards colder weather, we believe our baseload coal-fired and nuclear units are well prepared to meet the demands of this winter. These units have on-site fuel supplies that are not generally affected by extreme weather. And thus play a critical role in providing reliable and affordable electricity to the grid year-round. During the summer and fall months, we also performed a series of maintenance activities to prepare our baseload generating stations to meet the demands of the winter. We have set up heating elements that provide additional warmth to piping, added antifreeze to some equipment, installed storm barriers to protect from winter weather, provided temporary heaters in areas most susceptible to cold and increase fuel supplies at our coal-fired facilities. In addition, we will stay in close contact with PJM throughout the winter to avoid scheduling plant maintenance during periods of expected high electricity use. This work should help prepare our fleet for potential demand spikes this winter. Leila will provide an update on other initiatives within our competitive energy services segment, as well as introduce 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the business later in the call. With respect to our distribution business, we are very engaged on the regulatory front. We just reached the settlement in our West Virginia rate case and have several other active rate filings as well as all our fourth ESP in Ohio, all of which are moving through the regulatory process. We expect outcomes in all of these cases by May of next year. As these proceedings are completed, we will be able to provide much more transparency with respect to our expectations in the distribution business and the timely recovery of our investments going forward. In our transmission business, we continue to make excellent progress with our Energizing the Future initiative which Chuck will describe in more detail. We also filed with FERC last week to change the structure of ATSI\u2019s formula rate. The proposed change requests moving from an historic test year to a forward-looking test year, which will provide a better match of our cost as we continue our investments in this initiative. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.89 per share, in line with our expectations. We also reaffirmed our 2014 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 and $2.60 per share. Jim will provide more detail on that guidance as the mix of operating earnings among our reporting segments has changed slightly. At EEI conference next week, we plan to share more detailed information about the 2015 drivers in our regulated businesses and better frame future opportunities in our transmission business. Looking ahead, we will provide additional updates as we begin to get more clarity around other external drivers, such as ATSI filing and any further developments in the competitive markets than once we begin to receive result from a rate cases likely in the springtime frame. We\u2019ll be able to provide not only full 2015 guidance but significantly more detail and greater clarity into the financial and operational expectations across the company. It has been a busy and productive period and we are on track with a solid plan to build and strengthen our company. We have put into play critical elements that are needed to provide long-term value and stable predictable growth. We remain committed to driving change, both within the company and in our industry to better position FirstEnergy for the future. Thank you for your support. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck Jones for an update on our regulated businesses. Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Tony. I'm pleased to join the call today. I'll start with a brief look at our distribution business and then move to an update on our Energizing the Future transmission expansion program. We remain encouraged by the steady growth and stable load in the commercial and industrial sectors of our distribution business, both of which continue to benefit from the modest economic recovery and increased economic investment primarily related to shale gas. While weather was significantly mild compared to the third quarter of 2013, our distribution business continued to produce solid results. More important, as you have heard over the past several earnings calls, the overall trends for commercial and industrial deliveries remain very solid. In fact, adjusted for weather, we have now seen five consecutive quarters of growth in both the commercial and industrial segments. The industrial pipeline remains promising. Among this region's traditional industrial base, including steel, automotive, electrical equipment and petroleum sectors nearly all of our key customers are expanding and clearly shale related activity remains a bright spot. Signs point to continued and accelerated growth in this sector. In addition to its considerable impact on our distribution business, the shale industry is also driving growth in our transmission segment. Approximately $250 million of the regulated transmission investments we have identified for 2015 at TrAILCo are designed to meet rising electric demand, driven by the shale gas industry across our regulated service territories. This infrastructure, including high-voltage substations and transmission line is coming online to accommodate new shale gas processing facilities pipeline compressor stations and other energy intensive operations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. These midstream projects alone account for 1100 megawatt of anticipated electric load growth in 2015 through 2020. The rapid growth in the shale gas industry is transforming communities and creating new jobs and economic opportunities throughout our service territory. The investments we're making in transmission infrastructure will benefit customers throughout the Marcellus and Utica shale regions by boosting electric service reliability across the system. New electric infrastructure will directly support the build out of the shale gas industry and the resulting economic activity across the region. By upgrading our local power infrastructure, we can help communities attract other energy intensive industries while ensuring the highest levels of service reliability for every electric customer. But the shale industry is just one driver of the $4.2 billion in investment opportunities we are planning from 2014 through 2017 across our transmission footprint. In 2014, we are on track to complete $1.3 billion in investments, expanding 1100 projects this year. This year's initiatives include approximately 100 projects associated with generating plant deactivations, which we have discussed in the past. We continue to make steady progress with projects designed to enhance service reliability for our customers. For example, in Toledo, Ohio, we are constructing a new 48 mile 345,000 volt transmission line using existing transmission towers and building a new substation. This $32 million project which is on track for completion by June of 2015 is designed to enhance service reliability in our Toledo Edison Service area and to accommodate future electric load growth. In our Mon Power service territory, we are on track to complete a large expansion project this year that will support the electric demands of the areas rapidly expanding Marcellus Shale Gas industry, including 280 megawatts of incremental load that is expected to come on line in December. The $50 million project includes installation of the new substation, with state-of-the-art voltage support as well as sectionalizing equipment on an existing 41-mile, 138,000-volt transmission line, will enhanced service reliability for Mon Power customers along the Route 50 corridor in Doddridge, Harrison and Ritchie counties. These are just two examples of the hundreds of projects that are already completed or underway. We expect the transmission business to be our primary growth platform, not only through the previously announced $4.2 billion investments through 2017, but as we continue to implement our \u201cEnergizing the Future\u201d initiative for many years thereafter. In fact, only $1.6 billion of the initial $7 billion \u201cEnergizing the Future\u201d investments is being undertaken in this period. The vast majority of the current estimate is for RTEP projects related to generating plant shutdowns and to meet the increasing demands within the service area. We will layout additional details regarding future transmission investment opportunities at EEI next week. Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Leila. Leila Vespoli : Thanks, Chuck and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a brief update on our competitive business and then I will look at the status of our distribution rate cases and other regulatory matters. The transformation of our competitive business is well underway. As we announced in August, we are pursuing the effective hedging of the majority of our generation resources with reduced risk and at the highest margins possible, while leaving a portion of our generation available to capture market opportunities. The actions we have taken put our competitive business in a stable position, from which we can gauge market conditions and participate when and where the opportunities are most promising. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to allow attrition of our MCI and mass market customer base as contract terms expire, as well as weather sensitive LCI loads. Overall, contracts sales volume decreased by 4.5 million megawatt hours, compared to the third quarter 2013. At the same time, we are maintaining targeted sales levels to government aggregation customers in Ohio and participating in POLR auctions where we see value. During the past month, POLR auctions were conducted in both Pennsylvania and Ohio that will ultimately determine retail generation service rates for these small service customers. Both auctions produced results that appear to reflect an increased risk premium, which we believe is associated with volatility and uncertainty in PJM. In Pennsylvania, the auctions were for 12 months and 24 months, residential and commercial products for delivery beginning June 1, 2015. Auction clearing prices for residential products range from between $70.09 to $85.15 per megawatt hour, while clearing prices for commercial products range from between $74.46 to $89.65 per megawatt hour. HPS won nine tranches in that auction. In Ohio, HPS won four tranches in the 10th wholesale auction, which produced an average clearing price of $73.82 per megawatt hours. These results will be blended with previous auctions and one upcoming auction in January 2015, to establish retail generation rates from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016. For 2015, our committed sales are about 59-kilowatt hours. After 2016, committed sales are at 33 kilowatt hours, reflecting the currently committed sales growth of LCI, MCI and mass market, as well as the POLR and government aggregation sales. We remain on track to transition to a target portfolio of retail sales in LCI and government aggregation, as well as POLR sales in the range of 10 to 45 kilowatt hours annually. Let\u2019s look now at financial expectations. For 2015, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the Competitive Energy Services segment of $900 million to $1 billion. Given the slight increase in market prices versus mid-July, we are comfortably in the upper end of that range at this time. Last quarter, we told you that we expect our competitive business to be cash flow positive of the period 2015 through 2018 and we continue to support that expectation. This conservative forecast does not take into account the numerous uplift opportunities such as incremental auctions, the removal of demand response and other possible catalysts. We will revise our outlook if needed, as these issues are resolved. Today, we are introducing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. The reduction compared to 2015 is driven primarily by seven-month of high capacity prices in 2015 versus five months in 2016, and the amount of generation that clear 2015, \u201916 auction versus the \u201916, \u201817 auction. The 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance estimate also includes an additional 500 megawatts of capacity that cleared in the incremental auction for the 2016-17, PJM planning year held in September. That leaves about 2,700 megawatts still available to participate in the July incremental auction for the \u201916, \u201917 periods. I will note that adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are providing for both 2015 and 2016 does not reflect any of the changes that are being considered in the capacity markets or any estimates of future incremental auctions applicable to those periods. All of which could provide significant uplift, as the value of baseload generation is recognized in the market. We have put together in place a solid strategy to position our competitive business going forward. And I believe we are in a sound position to take advantage of market upsides. Let\u2019s shift now to a review of regulatory development. As Tony mentioned, PJM recently provided in more detail around his capacity performance proposals. Key elements of the proposal include classified supply resources into two groups -- capacity performance resources and base resources. Liming the amount of base capacity resources, that will be procured in the base residual auction, allowing units to satisfy the capacity performance criteria to offer into the RPM auction as the net cost of new entry and imposing significant penalties in the event of non-performance during peak usage periods. We do have some concerns around PJM\u2019s proposals. Last week, as a member of a coalition representing more than 69,000 megawatt of installed capacity in PJM, we advised PJM that three important changes should be made in the capacity performance proposal. First, a multi-year pricing mechanism that limits year-to-year price declines to not more than 5% should be incorporated into the proposal. Second, price cap for the transitional auctions should be increased to the net cost of new entry. And third, the proposed penalty structure should be reformed so that the potential penalties are better balanced with the financial opportunities for participating as a capacity performance unit. We will continue close engagement on PJM\u2019s proposal and will participate fully in the stakeholder and thought proceedings that are unfolding through the end of the year. Another key issue is the proper role of demand response in PJM markets. As Tony mentioned, the DC Circuit recently rejected a request for rehearing ruling that PJM does not have jurisdiction to regulate demand response by means of wholesale energy market rules and tariffs. At FERC\u2019s request, the Court has stayed the enforcement of its order until December 16 of 2014 and then pending FERC\u2019s potential request that the US Supreme Court accept an appeal of the Circuit Court's ruling. In light of possible outcomes from the decision, a PJM white paper recently proposed to move demand response from the supply side to the load side. However, because the proposal still would permit demand response to participate in price formation in the capacity markets, including potentially to set the market clearing price, we believe that the proposal is legally unsupportable. We have communicated our concerns with this approach to PJM and expect to continue this dialogue with PJM and affected stakeholders. Finally, on September 22, 2014, we filed our amended complaint regarding participation of demand response in the May 2014 base residual and obviously more rule develop on our complaint with order 745 proceedings progress. Let\u2019s now move to our assay formula rate filing at FERC. As Tony said, this filing, which was made on October 31st, proposes to change the structure of the ATSI formula rate. The proposed change requests moving from historic test year for transmission rates reflect actual cost from the prior calendar year to a forward-looking test year which would reflect the estimated cost for project expected to be in-service within the current calendar year, with an annual true-up which would allow for real-time recovery of cost. We have requested that new rates be effective on January 1. Turning now to review of state initiative. In Ohio, our fourth ESP called Powering Ohio's Progress, which was filed in August, is before the PUCO. In addition to building on the success of our current ESP, the plan includes the proposed economic stability program, which involved a 15-year purchase power agreement between our Ohio utilities and SEF, which will help ensure the continued operation of more than 3,200 megawatts of vital baseload generation while benefiting our customers by mitigating market volatility and rising retail prices. Hearings are scheduled for January with the decision requested by April 8, 2015. We continue working with customers, employees and officials on the state to advocate for this plan, which we believe is very good for Ohio and for our customers. Let\u2019s turn now to New Jersey where the Board of Public Utilities approved an Administrative Law Judge request for 45-day extension to render an initial decision in our base rate case. The ALJ\u2019s initial decision is expected to be filed by November 13. The BPU also issued a favorable decision in the generic proceeding reviewing its policy regarding the use of a consolidated tax adjustment and base rate cases. The Board stated that it would continue to apply its CTA policy and base rate cases subject to the following modifications proposed by the BPU staff. Calculate savings using a five-year look back from the beginning of the test year, allocate savings with 75% retained by the company and 25% allocated to rate payers and exclude transmission assets of electric distribution companies in the savings calculation. As it relates to our pending rate case, the order provides for the BPU following the initial decision of the ALJ to reopen the record for the limited purpose of adding a CTA calculation reflecting this modified policy. Although we are still reviewing the CTA order, by our interpretation and calculation we expect the CTA revenue adjustment to be reduced from approximately $56 million under the earlier policy to approximately $5 million to $6 million. In Pennsylvania, evidentiary hearings in the base rate proceeding of our four operating companies are scheduled for January 13 through 16, 2015 with the final order expected in May. And finally, in the Mon Power and Potomac Edison rate case yesterday we filed a settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, which is subject to their approval. The agreement includes a base rate increase of $15 million to help address operating costs at our power stations and our distribution business. It also moves the costs associated with the Harrison asset swap into base rate and eliminates the recovery of those costs through the temporary transaction surcharge. It also includes a vegetation management surcharge of approximately $48 million, recovery of nearly $46 million and cost associated with major storms of 2012 and increased billing assistance for low income customers. Parties to the settlement agreement include the PSC staff, the Consumer Advocate Division, the West Virginia Energy Users Group and Walmart. We're very satisfied with the settlement and believe it will provide us with the resources necessary to help ensure continued safe and reliable electric generation and service for our customers with reasonable returns for our business. Pending approval by the PSC the rate increases would go into effect on February 25, 2015. Thank you for your time. We are pleased with our progress to position the competitive business for future success and to assure a successful regulatory environment for our regulated businesses. Now let\u2019s turn the call over to Jim for a review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Jim Pearson : Thanks, Leila. As I discuss our financial results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report, which was issued this morning and is available on our website. As Tony mentioned earlier, our third quarter operating earnings were $0.89 per sh0are in line with our expectations. Third quarter 2013 operating earnings were $0.94 per share. On a GAAP basis 2014 third quarter earnings were $0.79 per basic share compared to $0.52 per basic share in the third quarter of 2013. A list of the special items that make up the $0.10 difference between our GAAP and operating earnings can be found on page 2 of the consolidated report. Now let\u2019s review the key drivers of operating earnings across each of our business segments. We will begin with our distribution business where we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.56 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the third quarter of 2013. Moderate weather was the most significant factor this quarter with lower distribution deliveries impacting earnings by $0.03 per share. With respect to the other drivers in the distribution business pension expense, depreciation, and interest expenses all increased slightly in the quarter. However, these factors were offset by earnings related to the Harrison/Pleasants asset transfer and a lower effective income tax rate. Looking more closely at the affects of weather on third quarter results, cooling degree days were 15% below last year and 17% below normal, which led to a 1.5% decrease in total distribution deliveries. Most of this impact can be seen in the residential sales, which decreased 784,000 megawatt hours or about 6% compared to the third quarter of 2013. In the commercial sector, third quarter distribution deliveries to commercial customers decreased by 199,000 megawatt hours or 2% due to the moderate weather. We can get a better picture of the sales trends by looking at the 12-month weather adjusted average for the period ending September 30. Over that time frame residential sales are basically flat compared to the same period a year earlier while commercial sales are up nearly 2%. Finally industrial deliveries, which do not have a strong correlation with weather, increased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by continued strength in most of our key industries, including steel, shale, refinery, electric manufacturing and chemical. The industrial sales trend over the 12-month period through September 30th also reflects a 3% increase. As Chuck mentioned, we're very encouraged by the continued strength of the commercial and industrial sectors in our region. And we remain optimistic that we are seeing signs of an authentic turnaround in the economy after the sharp declines that began in 2007 followed by long period of stagnation. Let\u2019s look now at our transmission business. Third quarter operating earnings were $0.13 per share, unchanged from the third quarter of 2013. Drivers in the quarter included higher transmission revenues as a result of the revenue requirement increases associated with ATSIs annual rate filing and higher capitalized financing costs related to our 'Energizing the Future' investment program. These were offset by higher vegetation management expenses and increased interest expense. In our competitive business, third quarter operating earnings were $0.25 per share, compared to $0.24 per share in the third quarter 2013. Operating earnings benefited from lower operating and maintenance costs, a lower effective income tax rate partially offset by lower commodity margin and lower capitalized financing cost. Commodity margin decreased operating earnings by $0.04 per share due primarily to lower contract sales volume and higher capacity expense partially offset by higher PJM capacity revenues. Additionally, while higher capacity rates resulted in higher contract sales prices, overall unit prices had a negative impact compared to the third quarter of 2013. As we mentioned in the past, this can be traced back to the significant decline in market power prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2011, when we held a larger open position for 2014 relative to 2013. Consistent with our strategy to reposition our sales portfolio, our overall retail customer account is now approximately 2.3 million, a decrease of about 400,000 compared to the third quarter of 2013. At the same time, total channel sales decreased 4.5 million megawatt hours or 16%. This decline is intentional, as we focus on effectively hedging our generation and eliminating weather sensitive low. Sales to governmental aggregation customers decreased 14% due to lower sales and eliminate an Ohio driven by pure customers and lower usage due to milder whether. Total generating output at our ongoing units increased 802,000 megawatt hours driven by fewer outrages at both our super critical coal units and nuclear fleet compared to third quarter of 2013. A strong generating output along with lower contract and wholesale sales resulted significantly lower purchase power costs. Commodity margin also benefited from higher capacity revenues and lower MISO and PJM transmission costs, while higher net financial sales and purchases, which are used to hedge our exposure to market pricing congestion volatility reduced market. The lower commodity margin was more than offset by a decrease in O&M resulting from lower retail and marketing-related expenses and decreased plant costs. Finally, I'd like to review the benefits we're seeing this year related to the effective tax rate. On a consolidated basis the effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.1% compared to 34.1% in the same period of 2013, resulting in an increase in consolidated earnings of $0.02 per share. The 2014 effective tax rate benefited from an IRS-approved adjustment that increased the tax bases in certain assets allowing for increased tax deductions. This was partially offset by higher tax valuation allowances. On a year-to-date basis consolidated effective tax rate is 32.4% compared to 36.2% for the same period in 2013. We continue to focus on managing our tax obligations through various federal and state planning initiatives and currently estimate our effective tax rate to be 30% to 31% for the year, primarily reflecting additional benefits in the fourth quarter resulting from the resolution of a state tax position. Our 2013 effective tax rate was 36.2% and we anticipate our tax rate going forward to be between 36% to 38%. Before we move on to review of financing activity, I'd like to take a moment to review our 2014 operating earnings guidance. As Tony mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and at the same time making adjustments among the segments. I\u2019ll walk you through these changes which are outlined on slide 154, the fact book that was posted to our website today. First; in our distribution business, the impact of mild temperatures lower than the forecasted residential usage and increased non-deferred storm expenses bring that segment\u2019s operating earnings to a new midpoint of a $1.93 per share for the year. We also see improvement in our competitive business from lower operating costs bringing the midpoint up $0.03 to $0.20 per share, an improvement in our corporate segment, reflecting the favorable tax rate increases the midpoint $0.05 to a negative $0.17 per share and regulated transmission remains unchanged with the midpoint of $0.54 per share. Finally, we continue to fund our transmission expansion program during the quarter through the issuance of $400 million of 30-year senior notes at ATSI in September. Also during the quarter, we re-marketed $241 million of pollution control revenue bonds at FirstEnergy generation and First Energy nuclear generation. We remain pleased with the strong overall performance of our transmission and distribution businesses during the third quarter and first nine months of the year. We have a solid plan in place across our company to drive results and we're committing to creating value for investors. Now I'll open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse :  Hey. Good afternoon guys. Tony Alexander :  Hello Dan. Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Hey. There was huge matter of information. Thank you for all that. I guess, looking at the PPA or the ESP process in Ohio, something that\u2019s come up and raised is the idea of the off-market transaction for 15 years in those assets. Can you just kind of walk through, maybe a little more of the legal justification for beyond the obvious benefits to Ohio customers or the visibility? Leila Vespoli : Hi, Dan. This is Leila. So obviously and proposing this, my legal team was very mindful of the legal precedence that was out there. I think from a policy perspective, we put forward a very wonderful case that we address that and then, I will go into more of the legal specifics. If you think about these plans, especially Ohio plans build and service Ohio customers, Ohio jobs, Ohio tax saves . So from a standpoint of, whether this is something that is beneficial certainly from an economic standpoint is very beneficial. Having this generation, as we justified on our filing also, over the 15-year period would provide essentially $2 million worth of benefits to customer, so acting like an insurance policy. From a legal perspective, if you think about the aggregate rule, Ohio is a competitive state. So we do not have captive customers. So FERC has waived the rule, it applied to us. Also, we were very mindful of two of the other cases up there, being the -- hit the (indiscernible) case and the Hanna case. And have put in place mechanisms within the case, so that we do not run or fall of the particular things in those cases that triggered FERC\u2019s finding that they were legally informed. So, offline, we can go into the details. But, again, the legal team is very mindful of that in the structure of the PPA proposal and what the commission can and can\u2019t do and the terms and conditions actually associated with the PPA. Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay. And I guess on the West Virginia settlement, the element that I haven\u2019t gone through all of it, given the earnings day today. But the Harrison plant probating contributed as much or any on this that we\u2019d expected on the first transfer. Would this settlement help get the full value of that rate base uplift into earnings going forward? Leila Vespoli : So, essentially, what this case did, so let me back up for a second so. In the Harrison transaction, we stipulated that case. In that agreement, we agreed to file this base rate case and so this is the case where we basically flipped what would have been surcharged into base rate. So, essentially, all we did is take what we\u2019ve covered in that revenue stream and flip it to base rate treatment. And then on top of that, the stipulation provides for an additional $15 million increase. And in addition to that, roughly $48 million of our vegetation management surcharged, which should help with our distribution and reliability which is good in West Virginia but should help enhance that as we go forward. The stipulation also provides for establishment of regulatory assets associated with mass investments in 2016 and \u201917, and other different provisions from the company's perspective, which we believe is very good. Again, this is a case that we filed as a result of a stipulation and I think -- prior stipulation and I think from a company standpoint, our customers\u2019 standpoint is a very good result. Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay. And just one last question just on the quarter. With this lower demand with the weather and all that, how much benefit did you guys see out of the retail business despite reduced volatilities, is that kind of what helped on some of the earnings gap this quarter? Donny Schneider :  Dan, this is Donny. In the main, what we saw obviously, there wasn\u2019t a volatility issue that we faced in the first quarter. But we took advantage of a lot of the O&M savings. We\u2019ve reduced the workforce and that sort of things, so that's really what flowed through for us in the quarter. Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Paul Fremont of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thank you very much. I guess my first question is, if I look at capacity performance and the potential hatter, how should we think of that relative to your PPA proposal in Ohio? Would you potentially rethink the offer in Ohio? Leila Vespoli : Hi Paul. This is Leila. So we made our filing and we are going to go full with our filing. I think, having the potential for capacity performance proposal by PJM and if it gets eventually approved by FERC, will be even a more enhancement for Ohio customers. But we would not withdraw our ESP commitment. I think overall the proposal by PJM is a positive development. But as I noted, I think there are ways that it could be improved. I think that they should consider with performance persistent pricing mechanism. If you think about it in terms of the generation, the need for revenue and kind of the longer-term horizon, if it were to have a mechanism whereby year-to-year, the downside were kept by 5% generators, where we could get a better sense of what the capacitive pricing might be from year-to-year that would definitely be a positive development. In the transitional years, we think it should be uncapped up to net cone, given that the markets, I think everybody\u2019s account have not produced the revenues that most agreed that they should have. We think that that would be a more appropriate place getting revenue to generators, so they can make the investment in their plans to increase reliability and a better balancing of the penalty structure. I think PJM approved upon it but we still think the penalty structure is a little bit more draconian than it should be at this point in time. Paul Fremont - Jefferies: And when, Jim when you ran through corporate another, I guess corporate another is already benefiting this year from tax, from lower tax what should we think of -- in terms of corporate and other as sort of a better indication for a run rate? Jim Pearson : Okay, Paul. I\u2019d said earlier our effective tax rate would be anywhere between 30% to 31% this year and its going to most likely move back up to the 36% to 38% of our range next year. So that that would be probably about $0.25 a share, Paul, and most of that flows through corporate another. Paul Fremont - Jefferies: So a $0.25 per share increase off of the 17, right? Jim Pearson : That\u2019s correct. No, not all of that will go to corporate but most of that would. Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Okay. And in terms of the nuclear leases. The last nuclear leases if I recall you bought them in the range of like $1500 per KW. Can you -- what type of a price did you pay for the most recent lease purchases? Jim Pearson : We haven\u2019t disclosed that yet Paul. The transaction hasn\u2019t completed yet. I can say I would say both parties are very comfortable with the price we paid. So that\u2019s something we are ready to disclose at this point. Paul Fremont - Jefferies: And the last question in West Virginia, was it a black box settlement or was there some agree to level of ROA? Leila Vespoli : So the parties agreed to the $15 million increase in the other terms. The commission actually asked that we -- in our filing how we got to that. So you will see us part of the settlement. If you go to the exhibits, each of the parties will lay out how it got there. The company has not laid out the ROE associated with it. But there is an ROR number. Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Yeah. Good morning. Sorry, good afternoon guys. Tony Alexander : Hi. Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Just a quick question on as we look at these adjusted EBITDA outlooks for the competitive business, am I right that this is a delta between the commodity margin and the EBITDA number is mainly O&M consistent -- and probably general taxes consistent with the earnings statement? Chuck Jones : That will be correct Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay. So I guess my question is when you look at the 15 to 16 numbers the implied expense number goes down about $100 million between 15 and 16. And if you look at the run rate on 14, its down quite a bit more than that 15 or 14. So can you just talk about how we think the components that bridges that as those numbers just seem quite big? Donny Schneider : Jonathan, this is Donny. Yeah I think if you take a look at the EBITDA from 15, if you\u2019re trying do come up a walk from 15 to 16. In \u201915, we\u2019ve got a midpoint of $950 million. And then if you look at what the capacity revenue does from \u201815 to \u201816, it comes down about $225 million\u2026 Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Yeah but\u2026 Donny Schneider : And then we have improved margins about a dollar megawatt hour so that\u2019s a positive about $80 million. And then other O&M and cost reductions, that\u2019s about $100 million, gets you right to about $900 million for midpoint. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay. That was already my question, is there a $100 million of O&M saving embedded in that forecast, it sounds like the answers is yes. Donny Schneider : Yes. That\u2019s throughout and we have one last nuclear outage in the \u201816 timeframe and that especially helps. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Can you also bridge so that we\u2019re in a $1.5 billion of non-GAAP O&M in a year-to-date through September and it\u2019s been running about $400 million at least last quarter. So how does it got from that number down to the $1.250 billion or so implied in the \u201815 guidance? What are the big drivers there? I\u2019m looking at the delta between\u2026 Jim Pearson : Jon, it\u2019s one or two have high rates, take it get back because there\u2019s probably a lot of components to make that up, so I shall get back to you after the call. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Happy to do that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : Good afternoon. Leila Vespoli : Hello. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : I wanted to explore the capacity performance penalty side of the equation and Leila, you touch briefly on it. Just curious if the ultimate roll ends up quite similar to the proposed penalty rule that PJM has laid out. Would that as you assess kind of the risk reward of your fleet? Do you think that would likely lead you to think about some degree of asset shutdowns, not at all or how do you generally think about that the risk of penalties? Leila Vespoli : So the penalty structure again, I think was mitigated from their prior proposal. But you can\u2019t look at it in isolation, you have to look at the other moving pieces in parts. Right now, the coalition noted in their comments that right now if you had a single 12-hour too bleak, it could cause you to lose the equivalent of 71 days of revenue. So there are both kind of things you need to look at and have a trade-off. If the pricing mechanism will raise in that color and you\u2019re able to recover that level. You might be able to think a little more positively about that kind of penalty. So again, there are a lot of moving pieces in parts and I wouldn\u2019t look at the penalty just in isolation. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Understood. And then just thinking also about carbon regulation and how the different states might look at that, I was particularly interested in Pennsylvania and Ohio, is it your sense that there is some probability to those states who think about joining the regional carbon mechanism such as regi, do you think the states are more likely to resist the proposed regulations? What\u2019s your general sense of those two states and how they are thinking about carbon? Tony Alexander : Stephen, this is Tony. I think at this point it\u2019s a little too early to tell. I still think that each states evaluating and trying to understanding and comprehend the proposed rule and as well as trying to figure out whether or not the alternatives to them moving from to a mass kind of calculation would be easier for them to manage. So, I think, at this point, everybody is trying to understand what\u2019s going on, not clear where they are going to end up yet. And my senses is that until we better understand how this rules going to be applied in the options, it will be hard for any one of the states to otherwise indicate exactly which way they are intending to go. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital : Thank you very much. I have two questions. One is, so I\u2019m clear in the guidance of 2016 the generation capacity that didn\u2019t fear in either the original or incremental auction is assumed not to receive any capacity revenues? Tony Alexander : That\u2019s correct, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital : Okay. And then second, I hope I misheard that one is, okay. So there is a change in the effective tax rate between \u201814 and \u201915, and what is the $0.25 of a swing? Is -- are you suggesting that the parent level drag increases from $0.17 to like $0.40? Jim? Jim Pearson : Yes. That\u2019s right, Angie. That will be the range. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital : Okay. But why is -- I mean, what was then the effective tax rate in \u201913 when we have about $0.27 or $0.26 drag? Jim Pearson : I think the effective tax rate in \u201913 was about 36%. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital : Okay. So it\u2019s a same type of rate that you\u2019re guiding for \u201915 and beyond. So why such a big delta? Jim Pearson : We have some additional debt outstanding and we have some of that debt had variable rates, so those rates could increase on that also Angie. So it\u2019s primarily associated with additional interest costs. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital : Okay. Thank you. Steve Staub : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more call. Operator : Certainly, the next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Tony Alexander : Yes, Paul. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : All right. There is some -- on slide 161 of the investor handbook. There is a large pension and OPEB cash flow item of $750 million to $550 million. And I was wondering that wasn\u2019t their last time and I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s the driver in that and why is there a cash benefit associated with that? Jim Pearson : Paul, this is Jim. What that slides referring to is that we looked at the discount rate at the end of the third quarter, which we traditionally do and we say what would be change to our GAAP earnings be, if that discount rate remain in effect till December 31. So what that\u2019s representing is a discount rate that goes from 5% down to a range of either 4.25% to 4.5%. That also takes into account a change in the mortality tables where the liability increases by 4%. So that\u2019s not a cash flow benefit, its just a change in the liability of our pension plan that we would have to report the impact to GAAP if the discount rates stays where it is today. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Okay. So, I mean, so in the sense, reconciliation of net income GAAP to FFO, this is a non-cash reversal. Jim Pearson : That\u2019s correct. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : So, I guess, okay. I\u2019ll have to follow up offline, I guess. And the deferred taxes in ITC that went down by about $190 million, anything in particular there? Jon Taylor : This is Jon. This is primarily just utilization of some of our NOLs that are making up the difference. So that\u2019s primarily the largest driver. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : I mean, just two back on the CES EBITDA, there seems to be an other income decrease on slide 136 and I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s the driver there in 2016? Jon Taylor : That\u2019s primarily lower earnings from some of the investments we have. We have an equity interest in a couple of different investments and we\u2019re seeing lower earnings in that period, so that\u2019s going to drive that down. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Jim Pearson : Okay. Thanks everybody. Thanks for joining us today. If you didn\u2019t have a chance to ask your questions, please contact our IR Department. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the Annual EEI Financial Conference in Dallas. As you heard today, we\u2019re making solid progress on the initiatives that the designed to deliver predictable and sustainable growth at our regulated distribution and transmission businesses. And you will hear more at EEI of our future transmission investment opportunity. In our competitive business, we\u2019re implementing a sound strategy to reduce risk, while positioning the business for the future. At the same time, we continue to strongly advocate for market reforms that can better support much needed price stability and service reliability and we\u2019re pleased to see growing momentum in support of these changes. We\u2019re building a foundation for long-term value and growth for our investors and we appreciate your continued support. Thanks and look forward to seeing you in Dallas. Tony Alexander : Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Participating in today\u2019s call are; Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets and Chief Legal Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Meghan, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to talk with you today. For today\u2019s call we are deliberately keeping our prepared remarks rather brief, so there will be plenty of time to take your questions at the end. Clearly the topic many of you will be most interested in is our 2015 earnings guidance, which we made public late last evening. But before moving to that discussion, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Tony Alexander for his leadership of FirstEnergy over the past decade. Tony guided our Company through a dramatic expansion and navigated through one of the most challenging periods in the history of the utility industry. As you know, we also announced last night that Tony\u2019s last day will be April 30th and we certainly wish him well as he begins his new chapter in his life and enjoys more time with his family. Since moving into the CEO position on January 1, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to either meet personally or talk with many of you over the telephone. We\u2019ve had some good two way conversation over the past couple of months. And I want you to know that the entire FirstEnergy team is committed to providing frank and open discussion about the challenges and opportunities we are facing as a company, that\u2019s why in light of the recent Pennsylvania rate case settlements we decided to provide you with our earnings guidance range earlier than originally planned, so you would have a clear sense of what we are expecting this year. The 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share is in line with the updated drivers for our utilities business and corporate segment that we provided in November, although some street expectations have not been adjusted to reflect that information. Looking at consensus estimates, we saw a fairly widespread of about $0.50 ranging from $2.60 to over $3.10 and we understand the challenges of modelling FirstEnergy giving all the moving pieces we have right now. Given the disparity between the street consensus and our 2015 base earnings, we believe it\u2019s very critical to ground the investment community on earnings sooner rather than later as we reset our utilities around the new growth strategy. After today, our focus shifts to customer service driven growth across the utility segment. In that light now that we have made our 2015 earnings guidance public, following this call Irene and her investor relations team will be happy to answer your detailed questions about all the disclosures we made yesterday and today including here in our consolidated report and in our updated fact book. In the future once all of the pending rate case proceedings are finalized modelling are going forward earnings power should be far more transparent. And we hope to better articulate that for you later this year during the analyst meeting where we expect to provide a growth target for our utilities as well as in overall strategic update on all three of our business segments. We continue to believe the initiatives that were put in place during 2014 laid the path for our future growth and success. So let\u2019s several minutes to review the key events of the past year. We successfully launched our Energizing the Future of transmission expansion program. Under this program, we will invest billions of dollars with an eye towards serving our customers better. These investments will improve reliability, add resiliency to the bulk electric system and install enhanced physical and cyber security to ensure our assets perform as designed. With our multiple rate proceedings, we have also set the stage for similar investment in our regulated businesses and more timely recovery of those investments. The recent major storm events that have impacted FirstEnergy service territory have highlighted the need for hardening of our distribution systems. And of course in the wake of the polar vortex and other severe weather events last winter we began taking a far more conservative approach in our competitive business to limit risk and -- focus on greater stability. We have made good progress on these efforts. Our West Virginia rate case settlement was approved by the state public service commission earlier this month and we have filed settlements in our Pennsylvania and Ohio rate proceedings that require regulatory approval. We also look forward to closure on the base rate case at JCP&L and remain hopeful that the board of public utilities final decision in that proceeding will appropriately include the $580 million incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms. Once that case is finalized we look forward to working with the BPU to make Jersey Central Power & Light a stronger company going forward. In our ATSI proceeding, we believe FERC\u2019s approval of our request to move to forward looking rates as of January 1 signals support for transmission investments for grid reliability. As we anticipated FERC accepted it subject to refund and also set hearing and settlement procedures and initiated an inquiry into ATSI\u2019s return on equity. We believe that more timely recovery associated with forward looking rates is a major benefit to us which outweighs the impact of a potentially modest ROE adjustment. This rate structure for ATSI will provide a much better co-relation to our cost as we continue to implement our Energizing the Future of transmission investment plan. That plan is comprised primarily of thousands of small, customer focus transmission projects and equipment upgrades that can be implemented relatively quickly across our existing 24,000 miles of transmission assets. These projects are designed to enhance system reliability and resiliency for our customers while providing long term and sustainable growth for FirstEnergy. I strongly believe that the right investments are those that customers value and are willing to pay for and that provide attractive returns for our investors. It\u2019s gratifying to report on the successful first year of that program. We overcame some weather related setbacks early in the year but by December we successfully completed our plan of $1.4 billion in new investments spanning more than 1100 projects. You can see the impact that that investment when you look at our financial disclosures for the transmission segment. The plan for 2015 calls for an additional $970 million investment across 430 projects including 1000 pieces of substation equipment and 300 miles of transmission lines. By the end of this year we expect to be well on track to meet our four year goal of $4.2 billion in investments through 2017. Key projects for 2015 include construction of a new substation and transmission line near Clarksburg, West Virginia to support an existing gas processing plant and reinforce the regional grid. We are also planning construction of a new transmission substation near Burgettstown town, Pennsylvania that will support low growth and improve service reliability for more than 40,000 customers of West Penn Power. At the EEI conference last November, we told you that we have identified about $15 billion in incremental transmission projects in 2018 and beyond providing a path to both improved customer service and a long term and sustainable growth platform for our company. Lets shift gears now and look at our competitive business. The actions we continue to take with regard to our more conservative strategy have been very effective at reducing the overall risk in this business. While our open position is subject to market movement we are structuring the business to be more predictable and self sustaining. Our conservative approach will better protect us in the event of extreme weather or unplanned outages at a major generating facility. We are projecting this business to be cash flow positive each year over the 2015 to 2018 period using conservative assumptions. I\u2019ve been asked numerous times about the possibility of divesting this business, frankly at this point in time it doesn\u2019t make sense while we are at or hopefully near the bottom of the market to sell these assets at the lowest value they will likely ever have. In addition, capacity market reforms and pending changes to the treatment of demand or response are likely to provide near term value for this business. Once these moving pieces play out we should have a much better picture of what we can expect from our competitive business going forward, at this point it remains a core business for FirstEnergy. However, we continue to monitor closely the financial performance of some of our individual generating units, particularly those located in western PJM. While the low market revenues are build into our financial models several of our units continue to struggle to run economically. The strategies we have in place in all three of our business segments are sound. They are the right priorities for our company at this time and in this environment and we will continue to refine them as conditions require or opportunities emerge. Along the way we intend to provide clear communication about our challenges, opportunities, strategies and goals. I\u2019m sure you will have many questions at the end of this call and we have full investor meeting schedule coming up. I will make myself available as often as necessary to ensure we address all of your questions. I also hope to get to know many of you more in the next several months. For those of you who are not yet familiar with my style, I was trained in as an engineer to solve problems. My career FirstEnergy has been focused on customers and looking for sound long term solutions. Our distribution and transmission businesses have been my main focus, although I did have the opportunity to oversee our competitive business for the couple of years as well. As I mentioned earlier, in my mind the best investments like the ones we\u2019re making in our transmission business are those that provide both customers and shareholders with real value. Its our responsibility to provide customer with a safe, reliable, affordable and clean electricity and my philosophy is that a commitment to these principals reflected in both our decision making and our management style is good business. Lastly, I believe very strongly in transparent communications whether to employees, customers, regulators or the financial community that mean saying what we know, when we know it. That\u2019s why we decide to write earnings guidance sooner than originally expected. Looking forward, we will remain focused on long term shareholder value, executing our regulated growth plans and taking a conservative approach to our competitive business. At the same time, we will continue to evolving [ph] to meet the needs of our customers who rely on electricity to power their businesses in everyday lives. It\u2019s my priority to move FirstEnergy to its next period of growth and success benefiting our customers, employees and investors. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a short review of 2014 financial results and additional details on our earnings guidance. Following Jim\u2019s remarks we\u2019ll open the call to your questions and we should have ample time to address whatever you\u2019d like to talk about. Jim Pearson : Thanks, Chuck and good morning everyone. This morning we\u2019ve reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. It was a strong quarter and solid year overall with numerous achievements. In somewhat of a change to past practice I won\u2019t cover the results for the quarter in detail by segment since that information is available in the consolidated report or from our IR team. Instead, I will speak to the major drivers and events while leaving more time for Q&A. For the fourth quarter of 2014 GAAP results were in loss of $0.73 per share. This includes special items of $1.53 per share of which $1.23 is related to our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment and as a non-cash item. This adjustment primarily reflects a 75 basis points decline in the discount rate and revise mortality assumptions used to measure our obligation. Moving now to our fourth quarter operating earnings drivers, consistent with the guidance we provided at EEI November, the FirstEnergy consolidated effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 predominantly reflecting a tax benefit associated with the resolution of state tax position. This drew a quarter-over-quarter benefit of $0.12 per share of which $0.10 was included in the corporate segment. And our regulated utilities overall distribution deliveries decreased fourth quarter earnings $0.01 per share. Total deliveries were down slightly primarily driven by milder weather which drove a 2.5% reduction in residential sales quarter-over-quarter. Industrial sales were up 1.8%, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. On the transmission side we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.14 per share in line with our expectations as we ramped up our Energizing the Future initiative. At our competitive operations results came in slightly better than expected for the quarter. Commodity margin was down $0.08 per share primarily due to lower contract sales that resulted from the change in retail strategy as well as mild weather. These factors were partially offset by higher capacity revenues related to the increase in the auction clearing prices. Let\u2019s move to a short overview of some of the key earnings drivers for 2014 which included a 6% earnings improvement in our transmission segment year-over-year as we launched our Energizing the Future Initiatives. On a competitive side of the business we experienced a year-over-year earnings decline of $0.51 per share due to the extreme weather events early in 2014, partially offset by the actions we put into place to reposition our sales portfolio and effectively hedge our generation by reducing weather sensitive loads. Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million in line with our expectations. At our regulated distribution utilities we\u2019ve reported 2014 operating earnings of $1.93 per share in line with the midpoint of guidance we provided in November. We saw the full benefit of the West Virginia asset transfer but also rising expenses for maintenance, depreciation, general taxes and interest without commensurate recovery in rates. However, as Chuck said, new rates that we expect to be effective in 2015 will reset the base line for a majority of our utilities. Distribution deliveries increased 1% compared to 2013 on both on actual and weather adjusted basis. Industrial sales were up each quarter and ended the year up 2%. At our corporate segment we benefited from multiple tax initiatives and ended the year with an effective income tax rate of 29.3%. As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 37% to 38% in 2015. Let\u2019s now move to a discussion of some of the 2015 operating earnings guidance details. On the regulated utility side which is where we believe most estimates did not fully account for the increases in ongoing expenses such as depreciation, interest and taxes, we expect a midpoint of $1.82 per share. This includes new rigs in West Virginia which will effective this month and our expectation for new rates in Pennsylvania which would be effective in May based on the pending settlement. For New Jersey, we assumed revenues neutral to 2014 levels but included $0.08 per share for amortization of deferred storm cost for both 2011 and 2012 storms. We expect moderate low growth in distribution sales of about 1%. Commodity margin at our competitive operations is expected to increase by $0.44 per share in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher ATSI capacity prices. For 2015, our committed sales currently are 67 million megawatt hours. Our 2015 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business has been revised to $875 million to $950 million, a slight decrease from our previous range given the drop in power prices since November. At our transmission segment, this year we expect an uplift of $0.11 per share related to the implementation of forward-looking formula rates as requested in our FERC filing and high rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. An although FERC has initiated an enquiry related to our ATSI, ROE we anticipate the range for that segment should accommodate the outcome of that process. At corporate a combination of a more normal effective tax rate coupled with increase net financing cost is expected to reduce 2015 operating earnings by $0.42 per share in line with the drivers we provided at the EEI. Last evening, we published detailed information regarding our 2015 guidance on our fact book, which is posted on our website. With that, I\u2019d like open the call for you questions. Operator : Thank you. We would now\u2026 Jim Pearson : Okay. As promised we have 35 minutes left for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] our first question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Neel Mitra : Hi. Good morning. Jim Pearson : Good morning, Neel. Neel Mitra : Jim, I had a question on the O&M expense at the regulated utilities, so it seems to go up $0.08 in 2015 and then in your drivers in 2016, it looks like its flat. Was just wondering what\u2019s causing the increase in 2015 and maybe what\u2019s the normalized run rate on a percentage basis for increases going forward? Jim Pearson : Going forward, Neel, I would say our O&M is going to be pretty much consistent with what we\u2019re reflecting in 2015. In 2015, we\u2019re seeing some additional O&M expenses associated with some of our rate filings and vegetation management mostly. That would be the primary driver. Chuck Jones : And vegetation management are big piece of it, in light of the major storms that we saw, we been spending a lot of money reclaiming our rights of ways and expanding our rights of ways which has been capital expense and we\u2019re going to be shifting more into more typically four year trim cycle which is going to shift some of that back to O&M. Neel Mitra : Right. So in 2016, it looks it shows its kind of neutral, as I mean you expected to be flat or do you expect kind of a consistent percentage increases as 2014 or 2015 between 2015 and 2016? Jim Pearson : No. In 2016 Neel we would expect that O&M to be flat to 2015. Neel Mitra : Okay, great. And then, is there any kind of update on the timing of the higher PPAs as far as when we get a decision and whether that would be before RPM? Leila Vespoli : Hi, Neel, this is Leila. Yes. So the procedural schedule slipped in Ohio little bit. We may have FirstEnergy supplemental testimony being due in March 2 as well as intervener testimony and Staff testimony on March 27 and hearings on April 13. Given that we\u2019ve asked for \u2013 originally asked for an April 8 decision date, obviously that is not going to happen. But from our standpoint I still think we\u2019re in a good place. Originally we had asked for April 8 date to commit two things. If you think about it from an FES perspective, FES needs to know to whether they have this generation and how to hedge it. So we need a reasonable period of time to allow FES to be put in to position to sell it. And also with regard to the RMP auction. I think given the schedule the way it is now we\u2019re FES is going to have to bid those units in along with the rest of the competitive generation and it just kind of a missed opportunity for the utility side to do that. But again I don\u2019t think a critical thing. it just would have been a nice to have kind of thing. So that\u2019s \u2013 it was respect to the schedule for us. As you may AEP has a case dealing with the PPA coming up, I understand decision will probably come out in the next two to three weeks or so and I\u2019m hopeful that will bode well for decision in our case. Neel Mitra : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. the next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Eggers : Hey, good morning guys. Chuck, I think Jim hit it well that you prior lot of us in the industry were surprised by some the expense lines of the utility, if you look at the earned ROEs for the jurisdictions how do you think those ROEs look in 2015 versus what you expect going forward meaning, are you going to see improvement in ROEs beyond this year, or we normalized at this ROE level? Chuck Jones : Well, Dan, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say, obviously I think given fiscal policy in our country there is going to continue to be pressure on ROEs as long as interest rates stay low. But absent regulatory action on our part I don\u2019t see any way that those are going to change. So once we get through Pennsylvania, we\u2019ll figure out where we end up with ATSI and we get through New Jersey. I think we\u2019re going to be in a pretty stable place there and I expect later this year when we do an Analyst Meeting that we\u2019ll be able to give you little more transparency into what those ROEs are company by company other than we kind of did the rate making and kind of a black box type environment. So hopefully we\u2019ll give you more clarity on that later this summer. Dan Eggers : Can I maybe ask that little clumsier than I meant to. From an earned ROE perspective, if you look at the different utilities and particularly with your rate cases having gotten resolved, should the earned realized ROEs kind of level out at where you are expecting in 2015 guidance or do you look at things in 2016 and 2017 that could allow ROEs to improve? Jim Pearson : I would think they\u2019re going to certainly level out at where we\u2019re at in 2015 and I expect overtime there will be some modest improvement. Dan Eggers : Okay, and I guess here Jim on the operating expenses you know being higher on the utilities something that you expected the Pension/OPEB in depreciation expenses seem to stand out from our math, can you just talk about what was underlying in some of those increases year-on-year and how we should think about those going forward? Jim Pearson : Yes let me start with the Pension/OPEB line Dan, that\u2019s primarily driven by the absence of a credit that is expiring over the 2014, 2015 timeframe. And then you have slightly higher pension expense associated with the mortality tables. So that\u2019s what drove the reduction in that line. From a increase in what I would say the depreciation and property taxes when I look at distribution that\u2019s pretty consistent year-over-year and if you look at 2013 to 2014 depreciation property taxes increased about $0.09 were showing about an $0.08 increase 2015 to 2016. And when you think about it, we\u2019re spending about $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion annually at our distribution company and we have about $650 million of depreciation, so we\u2019re spending more in our depreciation there so. I would look for that type of a consistent increase in depreciation and property taxes. From the transmission side, we showed a increase in depreciation property taxes of about $0.03 2013 to 2014 and that was showing the ramp up of our Energizing the future program. We spent $1.4 billion in capital; in 2014 we are expecting to spend just about $1 billion in 2015. So that $0.11 increase in property tax is really associated with that increased capital and essentially the timing of when it goes into service. Dan Eggers : Okay. Just one last question just on the transmission side with the CapEx down this year versus last year, I know that was part of the plan you laid out in the fall but because you have a lot of smaller projects what could motivate you guys that allow the opportunity fee you spend more money in 2015 than you\u2019ve budgeted so far? Chuck Jones : I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to spend more money in 2015 than we budgeted, so wouldn\u2019t want to leave you with that impression. You know one of the critical aspects of that plan quite frankly is getting the workforce to be able to construct these projects and there is a constraint on that across our nation, but we have locked in through a partnership with Quanta workforce that will be available to FirstEnergy well into the future and I think that it makes sense to just approach this in a kind of steady predictable fashion. The drop off from 2014 to 2015 is due to the fact that we had a number of reliability projects that PJM ordered as a result of the late plant closings that were finishing up and putting in service early this year. Dan Eggers : Great. thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Good morning, sorry about that. Can you hear me? Chuck Jones : Yes, we can hear you Paul. Paul Patterson : On the $0.30 per transmission that you guys are projecting for 2015, how much of that is in the [Indiscernible] Forward treatment that you guys are expecting? And just on that for a quarter, as I recall my understanding was that they really hadn\u2019t signed off on the Ford test-years treatment. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I know the settlement discussions must be encouraged and I think they are still going on, can you give us any flavour for that as well in this context of the Forward test-year stuff? Leila Vespoli : This is Leila, I\u2019ll answer the latter part of the question first and then turn it back over to Jim. So you are correct, we are in the settlement of process associate with that, there has been no set procedural schedule although if thing stay inline you might expect that decision in that case maybe late this year or slipping into the first quarter of the following year. With regard to the rate they have not left the forward looking tester, what they did is put the rate into effect subject to refund. So January 1st we started it and I think the refund date was something like the 12th or 13th of January. So that\u2019s where it stands from a procedural schedule standpoint. Jim Pearson : And Paul to your first question that $0.30 uptick in revenues there, the majority of that would be associated with actually in the forward-looking test year. Paul Patterson : Okay. But you guys feels confident I guess I mean with respect to your settlement discussions and what have you about the forward test year treatment is that Leila that fair enough to say? Leila Vespoli : I think if you look at past President at FERC I think the forward-looking test year part of it even though that is an issue that the party is raised is something that you know from my standpoint I feel very comfortable on, I mean some of the other things they are looking at you know \u2013 Interveners allege is you know -- finding the system. They are also looking at the protocols for true up. So from my standpoint officially given how Chuck described what it is we\u2019re doing and the reliability aspects of this I feel very comfortable where we are. The one thing we have always highlighted is the rate of return and the fact that we thought that that would be an issue and not withstanding that we felt that appropriate to go in with the formula rate. If you want to think about it every 100 basis points is about $16 million and so you know if you then look at past President you can do your own calculation with regard to that. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. Jim Pearson : Paul, I just want to point out, I\u2019m sure you understand this, but because the 2014 expenditures were you know lagging rate mechanism and now the 2015 expenditures are in a forward-looking mechanism what you are seeing in terms of the shift in earnings from 2014 to 2015 really is two years worth of expenditures. So that\u2019s not the number that you are going to expect to see going forward. Paul Patterson : Great. Thanks for the clarity guys. And then Chuck you mentioned in your remarks that you wanted I believe the merchant business to be more self sustaining and also that your thoughts of the market was at a very low price and \u2013 power prices and what have you in that it just being the wrong time to divest the business if that were the case. And I guess the question that I have is A, if your market outlook changed would you be willing to perhaps look at breaking off these companies if it were possible? And then just B, what\u2019s your appetite for additional investments perhaps and merchants just and in general how do you see the merchant arm of this business which is clearly very different than the rest of the business, how do you see that strategically going forward, do you see a possibility of a spin off or just in general how should we think about how you are really looking at this business and what you might do strategically to enhance value? Chuck Jones : So here\u2019s how I am thinking about it. And I have told several others who \u2013 asked this question, I wanted to long time ago never say never and never say always. So, things can change, but for now we\u2019re looking at running that business in a mode where we remain cash flow positive where we used those market changes that are coming to take that cash and begin retiring some of the holding company debt that\u2019s associated with that business and overtime put that business into a position where we can have more flexibility and how we look at it. And then if you can tell me what the market\u2019s going to be like in two years, three years, four years, I think I could answer what I would do depending on what that market\u2019s like. But I don\u2019t think anybody can tell us what that\u2019s going to be. So right now we\u2019re hedged down, we\u2019re committed to running a cash flow positive and we are committed to de-risking it so that it doesn\u2019t continue to be the conversation when 80% of our company is regulated and generating absent [ph] today and getting everybody kind of in line with where we are at, generating consistent predictable regulated earnings, so that\u2019s the plan. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thanks so much. Jim Pearson : Hey Manny, before we go move forward, I intended [ph] to know when I was giving Dan an explanation on the increase as of depreciation year-over-year I said it increased 2016 versus 2015 I should have said 2015 versus 2014. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I wanted to go back again to the distribution earnings, I mean we are clearly missing a piece here, so you\u2019ve just gone to rate cases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and West Virginia. You know what if your cost structure going into these rate cases, you showed us what is the pre-tax impact of the rate case settlement or decisions and yet we have all of this $0.25 plus drag from higher cost on the distribution side, shouldn\u2019t that have been already reflected in the rate cases that you have gone through and also is this just an attempt to basically reset the base for future growth of this business and have fetched us just incremental on them [ph] spending that basically is not recurring? Jim Pearson : Angie, yes this is Jim. Some of the expenses that we had incurred was to prepare us for these rate filings that we had. As I said earlier we would expect that our O&M is going to held flat going into next year and we will be realizing the full impact of all of those rate filings next year. As Chuck said earlier, I would look at 2015 as our base line that we are going to start growing those distribution earnings from that point and you know we\u2019ll be said that provide more clarity on that at the analyst day meeting that we have. Angie Storozynski : Okay, but can you please give us a sense of this growth that other regulated utilities can offer. I mean is this a meaningful step up starting in 2016 for distribution? Jim Pearson : For this point we are not giving any type of 2016 guidance but you know this is the base line that we would expect to start showing growth at our distribution utilities. I don\u2019t think we are going to put a percent out there yet until we fully understand what\u2019s reflected in all of the regulatory outcomes and that we\u2019re comfortable and confident that we\u2019ll be able to deliver on that. Chuck Jones : We\u2019re got some work to do here, we have a settlement but it hasn\u2019t been approved by the PA regulators, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for us to assume that we still got work to do in New Jersey and obviously we have a big case pending in Ohio. Once all that settles out then I think we are in a better position to decide what\u2019s our investment strategy going forward, what\u2019s our plan for each of those states going forward and that\u2019s what we plan to tell you later this year once we get all those answers. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to just follow up I think really on Paul\u2019s question on the sort of market outlook, you all are fairly physically close to a lot of the shale gas activity and we\u2019re seeing a lot of development of shale gas. I was \u2013 just have a high level interested in your market take in terms of what the growth in shale gas really means longer term for power prices, what\u2019s your expectations, it sounds like from Chuck\u2019s earlier comments that you are relatively bullish on power prices relative to the four, I was just curious how you think about the dynamics from the shale gas that we are seeing being developed right around in your territory? Jim Pearson : Well first of all I\u2019m not sure what I said to make you think I was bullish on forward curve power freight [ph], because that\u2019s quite to the contrary. I think as we look at the shale gas issue we have to look at it in a couple of different ways. The first way is on those forward price curves and we actually had IHS in yesterday to talk to us about their views. And I think you know for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re not expecting any significant uptick in those forward price curves, so we are structuring our competitive business around those forwards as we know. The other side of that coin is it\u2019s the economic development engine that\u2019s driving growth in our territory and over the next few years we expect to connect over a 1000 megawatts of new load directly attributed to the midstream part of that business, you know there are discussions underway about upto three cracker plants in our region, if any or all of those come to fruition I think those are the foundation for an industrial revolution in the part of the country that we serve. So that\u2019s the upside long term, the reality in short term is we expect gas prices to stay fairly low. There is some congestion in the gas markets that\u2019s going on right now, but there is also roughly $20 billion worth of gas transmission projects that are under construction and expected to go in service over the next few years that will release some of that congestion and eliminate some of the basis difference between our zone and the rest of the country. And that might have a modest change but all in all we are planning to run our regulated business around the market forward as we see them today. Stephen Byrd : Okay, great. And just wanted to touch base on your hedging strategy given that they are repaying [ph] your seen in the market any changes in terms of your thinking in terms of the volume that you\u2019d like to hedge or given what you said about sort of your market outlook, any changes we should expect in terms of how you all think about hedging your generation fleet going forward? Chuck Jones : I would say no. And what I said my prepared remarks was, we\u2019ve structured that business in a way where we are trying to expose risks to volatility as associated to weather and to kind of protect ourselves against an unplanned generator outage, so we have the ability to generate 80 to 85 million megawatts hours a year. We\u2019re going to sell something less than that, so that as the load fluctuates with weather our committed load fluctuates with weather and/or we have issues that any of our plants we have the ability to cover ourselves. That will \u2013 I understand were likely giving up some earnings potential from that business by taking risk out of it, but as I said earlier I\u2019d rather make it more predictable, more stable and get it out of the conversation as much as I can so we can talk about the type of company FirstEnergy really is which is a large regulated utility with 6 million customers. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s very clear. And just lastly very briefly the \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some relatively extreme weather through the winter time, in general how has the fleet performed through this sort of this winter period that you are seeing, have you been satisfied with the performance of the fleet and anything compared to sort of prior years in terms of performance trends. Chuck Jones : I would say our fleet has performed very well, the markets have not. So had two units at the Bruce Mansfield plant that didn\u2019t run for six days in the last two weeks because the LMP at those plants we couldn\u2019t make money, so we didn\u2019t run out. So but the plants are available, they are running well, our generation team has done an amazing job between last year and this year getting ready for this winter. Stephen Byrd : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi Julien Jim Pearson : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations again. I really wanted to focus on the transmission side of the business, specifically the guidance. What are you guys assuming in terms of an earned ROE, I know that may be awkward in the context of your pending case for ATSI, but can you give us a sense of how much lag is embedded in that number and as you turn towards the forward test year and implementing that in kind of a run rate for 2016 what kind of improvement should we be thinking about there and what\u2019s ultimately reflected in 2015 specifically? Chuck Jones : All right. So I\u2019m not sure if I got all of those, I\u2019m going to answer the first quesztin and then you can answer or ask them one at a time, it will be easier for me to follow. So, but the first question on you know, we get that question a lot of what are we assuming about ATSI\u2019s rate of return going forward and here\u2019s how I view this. We just got first approval January 1st to move forward. There are \u2013 there\u2019s a case now that going to be had and there\u2019s a settlement process that\u2019s going to be had and my view is we\u2019re going to go into those arguing like 12.38%, it makes sense going forward and it\u2019s stimulating the type of investment and reliability that I believe folks should want. And that\u2019s our going in position, anything from there I give you a number then we are going to be negotiating from that number. So we\u2019re not going to give you a number, we are going to go into those settlement that settlement process and we\u2019re going to make the best case we can to make sure that we get the right return for our investors so that we can continue making these investments in the way that we are. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But from a regulatory lag perspective, what are you assuming if you can talk to that. Chuck Jones : Regulatory lay we are assuming forward-looking rights. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. So there\u2019s not necessarily improvement next year as you have a full year or have you? Chuck Jones : No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got you. And then in terms of the outlook for transmission CapEx how are you feeling about flowing dollars in the transmission versus distribution. Can you kind of elaborate a little bit on where you see capital going in the future and then subsequently I know we\u2019ve discussed this before, on the distribution side, what kinds of future investments do you see now that you\u2019ve gone or about to go through all of the state utility rate case? Chuck Jones : So lets take transmission first. We\u2019ve told you about 4.2 billion over a four year period that was in the second year of it was 1.4 billion the first year, it\u2019s 900 and some million in the second year. After two years we\u2019ll be right on track to be halfway through that and for 2016 and 2017 that will be the number. We have $15 billion worth of projects in addition to those that are in the four year plan that we can\u2019t execute. That hopefully albeit in a position that when we talk to you later this year to articulate kind of more of a long term strategy for transmission and what we are planning to do there. But for the foreseeable future the numbers we\u2019ve given you is what my plans are and I think one of the things that I have to start doing is saying what we are going to do and then doing what we say. So I don\u2019t expect any change in that over the next couple of years. On the distribution front, the rate cases in Pennsylvania are a huge step. It rebases those utilities and it was a necessary step if we decide to make reliability improvement investments in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has a methodology that\u2019s available to us called the disc that we can make investments, but as I told you when you came in, we got to get through these rate cases first and then we\u2019ll make decisions there. And in my prepared remarks I said once we get through the base rate case in New Jersey then I look forward to the certain amount of BTU and working together to figure out how we make JCP&L stronger going forward. In Ohio we have a DCR mechanism that we have been using to invest in those utilities. So later this year I know you want numbers, I\u2019m not prepared to give you numbers today, but later this year, I think we can lay out a strategy of how much and where we plan to invest to start using our distribution utilities to improve service to customers and improve the picture for shareholders at the same time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got you. And you are interested in using the disc mechanism to be clear in terms of\u2026 Chuck Jones : I think we will definitely look at it once we are done and then decide is that the best way and does it allow the right investments because more importantly to me is making the right investments that truly benefit customers. And if that makes more sense to make them and just have traditional rate cases then we\u2019ll go that way. But to me we have to lay out what the plan is for customers first and make the right investments. If that can be done under the disc then the disc would be a smart way to do it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey good morning. More of like I guess a long term view question or I guess earlier in your remarks you had said that you are not interested in selling the generation assets and I maybe paraphrasing just you thought that was kind of a departmental market, but as I think three to five years if you are locking up the assets now in terms of the regulatory agreement, aren\u2019t you locking that in at these depressed prices and don\u2019t \u2013 three to five years will not be able to benefit if there is a power price recovery? Chuck Jones : Well, so let me opine a little bit on what\u2019s going on in Ohio, and you know I am of the belief that long term those states that remained fully regulated when you have the opted\u2014the ability to optimize between generation transmission and distribution you are going to serve customers best. Some of our states chose to go to competitive markets. This whole discussion in Ohio is around whether or not we trust regulators better to look out for the long term interest of customers or whether we trust markets better to look out for the long term interest of the customers. Those states that are net importers of generation end up with the highest cost and don\u2019t have the ability to optimize between those three segments, so if the PPA is successful we\u2019re basically taking those plants and turning it over to the regulators to regulate them again. They will have a chance to look at how we run them, to look at the prudency of our expenses, but we are saying I think we trust the regulator to look out for a future Ohio more than we do the markets today. Anthony Crowdell : Great. thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead. Ashar Khan : Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to thank Tony for his leadership during the very very hard period and I wanted to congratulate you on your taking over the responsibility of the new position. Thank you. Chuck Jones : Well thank you. And I\u2019m sure Tony does too, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s listening. We don\u2019t have a microphone in front of him, but I\u2019m sure he is listening this morning. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Paul Ridzon of Keybanc. Please go ahead. Paul Ridzon : Just I think you made a comment about 100 basis point of ROE at actually was it $16 million of net income? Leila Vespoli : That was a comment I made and pre-tax, yes. Paul Ridzon : Pre-tax, okay. And then I know you are not going to give a growth rate, but given the moving pieces we have with the timing of Pennsylvania rates coming in and New Jersey, do you think 2016 will be a step up from 2015 at the on the regulated side obviously competitive is going to be very well\u2026 Chuck Jones : Well 2015 only includes seven twelfths of what Pennsylvania is worth, so in 2016 it will be a full years worth of treatment and then beyond that we need to see where we land in New Jersey and Ohio. Paul Ridzon : And what was your assumption as far as New Jersey in guidance? Jim Pearson : Yes what we assumed in the guidance Paul was that it would be revenue neutral and that there would be $0.08 of storm caused amortization associated with the 2011 and 2012 storms. Paul Ridzon : Effective one, is that going to bleed into 2016 as well? Jim Pearson : That would be effective March 1st , so you might have just slightly higher amortization year-over-year. Paul Ridzon : Any sense of when you are going to hold your Analyst Day? Chuck Jones : Not yet. Paul Ridzon : Okay, thank you very much\u2026 Chuck Jones : It will be after we have a decision in Ohio, a decision in New Jersey, a decision hopefully on ATSI and then we\u2019ll go from there. Paul Ridzon : Okay thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Chin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Brian Chin : Hi good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning, Brian. Brian Chin : About a year ago the management team had expressed a possible interest in looking at the REIT structure for transmission growth opportunities and given now that there is an entity out there that\u2019s you can see what the cost of capital is like, just wanted to see if you could give us an updated sense of that and Chuck also any comments you have there on your perspective? Chuck Jones : I\u2019m not sure. We are always looking at any option that\u2019s out there, but I\u2019m not sure that we saw at that time or see today any real benefit to a REIT for our company. Our company is a little complex in terms of we\u2019ve got transmission that\u2019s inside utilities, transmission that\u2019s inside the ATSI, transmission that\u2019s inside TrAILCo the transmission that\u2019s inside ATSI, the real estate is owned by the utilities and I just think it\u2019s a distraction that would take a lot of time and effort of the management team to figure out that we don\u2019t need to be looking at right now because it doesn\u2019t provide any significant long term financial advantage for us. Brian Chin : That\u2019s very clear. And then just one additional question you had mentioned in your prepared comments PJM West plant, plant box and some plants appear to be a little bit more struggling here. Is the primary criteria that you are thinking about cash flow accretion it seemed to be that you are leaning towards trying to get the merchant generation business to be cash flow positive so is that really the criteria that we should be thinking from a plant perspective here? Chuck Jones : So we have the merchant generation business cash flow positive for the next four years at market forwards as we know them and with capacity as we know it. So that\u2019s not our goal, that\u2019s where we are at. As we see the changes that are happening with the capacity market reforms, that\u2019s going to be additive. We\u2019ve put ourselves in a position with our generating fleet that we\u2019re not forced to generate because we have load committements. We\u2019ve got a significant amount of our generation that\u2019s going to be market driven generation. That gives us the ability like I said two weeks ago to say if Mansfield is not in the money we\u2019re not going to run it and loose money. So we\u2019re going to optimize it and that optimization is something that we\u2019re going to do day in day out. We\u2019re going to do day in kind of more as we look at any options on the retail side as new customer opportunities present themselves, but the goal is, is cash flow positive and were there. And then beyond that we want to obviously drive it more cash flow positive so that we can start getting additional flexibility in that part of our business down the road. Brian Chin : Thank you very much. Meghan Beringer : Manny we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. The final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thanks guys for taking my call this late in the hour. Just thinking about the balance sheet and capital structure, you guys did a really good job year and a half or so ago of reducing the debt levels at the competitive business. You narrow in a position where you\u2019ve got a lot of debt at the holding company level and a lot of it is short term or floating rate, many economist would argue that short term debt is probably at its all time lows and that directionally short term debt is likely heading high up. Do you have any thoughts in terms of how you can deal with the significant amount of short term debt that\u2019s on the balance sheet, meaning whether you would turn [ph] it out and therefore kind of lock in a long term interest rate for that and kind of give yourself some multiyear certainty of that or would you potentially pay it off and if so where \u2013 how would you where would you receive the proceeds or how would you generate the proceeds to pay down some debt? Jim Pearson : Michael, at this point I think we need to see how a number of these initiatives play out. If you think about the PPA in Ohio finalizing the rate cases, the potential for the capacity performance product I think that will give us a much clear sense of what our cash projections will be going forward. At this point we have no plans to term out any of the long term debt that\u2019s sitting at the Holdco. I do agree with you that we are carrying more debt at that level than either Chuck and I are comfortable with, but as we lay out our long term plan going forward, it will be our intention to strengthen the balance sheet and with that reducing some of that debt at the holding company, but at this point I cannot give you a specific plan to do that until we know some of the outcomes of these major initiatives. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thanks Jim and Chuck, congratulations. Chuck Jones : Thanks Mike. Chuck Jones : Okay, well I\u2019d like to thank you all for your continued support of FirstEnergy and I think you know our goal today was to give you a clear and transparent view of our company and to build the foundation for our growth strategy that we will lay out in more detail this year at the analyst meeting. I\u2019m proud to have the opportunity to take over for Tony. I am proud of our employees at FirstEnergy because I truly believe that\u2019s what makes our company strong and I\u2019m thankful for our six million customers and obviously all of our investors. Take care everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Meghan, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today. We had a good quarter and we are off to a great start for the year. Since our last call in February, we have continued our work to position FirstEnergy for solid, predictable and customer service driven regulated growth. This morning we will talk about our progress on those strategies. We will also discuss other key initiatives, including an important effort that is underway to reduce our cost structure and drive improvements to our balance sheet and of course, we will review our first quarter financial results and operational performance. Similar to our last call, we intend to keep these prepared remarks brief to allow ample time for your questions before the end of the hour. Our first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share are slightly above the top end of our guidance range and give us a solid foundation to start the year. We benefited from the growth in our transmission business and solid distribution performance that was assisted by a second year of unusually cold weather. Our year-over-year results also reflect the actions we began taking in the second quarter of 2014 to reposition the retail sales portfolio in our competitive business. For the past year we have talked about the extreme weather events of 2014 first quarter and the impact those conditions had on our competitive business and our strategy. The first quarter 2015 was even colder with heating degree days totaling 21% above normal and 2% higher than 2014. The PJM market also set a new winter peak of 144,000 megawatts, exceeding the previous winter peak, which was set in January of 2014. In our competitive business, however, the difference in our results between this winter and last is striking. This improvement speaks to the benefits of our more conservative strategy, which includes three major components. First, selling no more than we produce in order to maintain an open position of at least 10 million to 20 million megawatt hours annually to protect against extreme weather, unplanned outages or a combination of both. As a result of our actions to strategically reduce load obligations, our 2015 retail and polar obligations are expected to be about 68 million megawatt hours, compared to 99 million megawatt hours in 2014. Second, reducing exposure to weather sensitive load, from January of 2014 through March of 2015, our overall retail obligations are down nearly 35% on an annualized basis, with much of that coming from serving fewer of the most weather sensitive residential and small commercial customers, and finally, a more rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. This strategy together with improved plant operations helped to mitigate the potential downside from this year\u2019s severe first quarter weather and demand conditions, even though our region experienced four more below zero days this February than last January. As contracts continued to roll-off, we expect a further decrease in our annualized retail load obligations through the end of this year, a much of that decline will be associated with the most weather sensitive load. As I\u2019ve mentioned to many of you previously, we recognize that reducing risk in the business also means that we are likely giving up some earnings potential, but as we have said, our objective is to make the competitive business more stable as we focus our efforts on growth in the regulated businesses. In that regard, the last few months have been a busy period for our energizing the future transmission investment program. We are nearing completion of projects that are designed to maintain service reliability in the wake of plant deactivations in Northern Ohio. Those plants ceased operations for good on April 15th. These projects included the Bruce Mansfield-Glenwillow project, a 195,345 kilovolt transmission line extending on 119 miles from Western Pennsylvania to Suburban Cleveland, scheduled to go in service by June 1. In addition, we are preparing to energize new 345 kilovolt substation and associated transmission upgrades in Wood, Trumbull and Stark counties, which are designed to maintain service rollout reliability in Northern Ohio after the plants are closed. We also continued our work to strengthen the grid to help protect it from storms and make network and physical security upgrades. Finally, we're on track with our planned investments on projects that will support the midstream gas operations with about 365 million in the pipeline through 2019. On the regulatory front, our rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have concluded. In Pennsylvania, we were pleased that the PUC accepted our rate plan settlements for each of our four utilities in the state. The new rates which will be effective on Sunday will help our operating companies continue to enhance reliability and service to our Pennsylvania customers. We are looking at further options for customer focus investments going forward, including the option to possibly request a distribution system improvement charge to recover the cost of those investments. In New Jersey, we received recovery of approximately $580 million in costs incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms and we're glad to have a long process and uncertainty behind us. Now we look forward to working with the BPU as we set a course for future infrastructure and reliability investments at JCP&L. We've had a good and productive start to the year, and we are making solid progress toward our long-term goals. Looking forward, there are still three major initiatives underway that will ultimately help shape our company and our strategies going forward. First, in Ohio, the hearing on our electric security plan has been delayed by 60 days and is scheduled to begin on June 15th. As you know, in its recent decision on the AEP and Duke cases, the PUC ruled that stability writers related to purchase power agreements similar to our proposal are legal in Ohio. This was an extremely significant outcome. We believe that our filing includes a robust case for how our proposal benefits utility customers and supports economic development in the state. On May 4th, we expect to file supplemental testimony to further demonstrate how our plan meets the factors outlined in the AEP and Duke cases. While we're comfortable with the new schedule set by the PUCO, this schedule will affect the timing of our analyst meeting, which we had hoped to have this summer. We believe that it makes sense to host this meeting after we receive a decision in Ohio, which pushes us to sometime late this year. The second open [merit] [ph] t could have a significant impact on our business is the PJM capacity performance proposal. PJM has addressed FERC\u2019s question into the structure of the product. Pending its final decision, FERC granted PJM's requested waiver to delay the May capacity auction to no later than the week of August 10th. We appreciate the care and long-term perspective that FERC is taking in its review of this important mechanism and expected both PJM and FERC are interested in reaching a resolution as soon as possible. In both of these matters, we look forward to a final outcome that produces better clarity for our company and produces benefits for electric consumers in our region. On a related item, as you know we had delayed our decision to construct a new dewatering facility for our 2400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield plant in Pennsylvania while we evaluated the plant\u2019s future, particularly with respect to the results of the next capacity auction. We will continue to monitor market conditions but given the current environment including the auction delay, we think it makes sense to move forward with some early aspects of this project. This work is designed to preserve our ability to continue operations of the plant after December 31, 2016. All costs associated with this project are in our current business plan. We, of course, intend to remain sharply focused on those things we can control, including our own spending on goods and services, operating expenses and other corporate spending as well as capital expenditures. Last month, we launched a cash flow improvement project intending to capture both a mediate and long-term savings opportunities that are meaningful and sustainable. A team led by FES President, Donny Schneider, is working to identify savings and process improvements across the company with a particular emphasis on our generation business. The team is focused on expense reductions, capital expenditures and inventory. We are also working with an outside consultant to examine the significant savings potential in our supply chain. With more than $2.5 billion in annual spending in the project scope, we believe that significant cost savings opportunities are available while continuing to successfully serve the needs of our organization, customers and employees. I will note that workforce and benefit reductions are not included in the scope of the project. In all, we are targeting $50 million in savings this year and an additional $150 million in 2016, reaching a run rate of $200 million by 2017. We expect that the savings will be split about evenly between O&M expenses and capital expenditures and help us create sustainable levels for the future. By appropriately addressing our cost structure, we can help direct our future and move FirstEnergy to a point that our fundamental operations make the company stronger while improving the balance sheet over time. We\u2019re off to a solid start in 2015. Our early financial results together with our progress on our strategic initiatives are building a solid foundation for the year and for the future of our company. These results in our outlook for the remainder of the year continue to support 2015 operating guidance in the range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Consistent with the leadership philosophy, I have shared with many of you, I would like to narrow the gap between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. While some differences are expected, we are diligently focused on earnings quality. Now we will turn the call over to Jim for brief review of our first quarter financial results then we\u2019ll open the call to your question. Jim Pearson : Thanks Chuck and good morning everyone. Consistent with our approach in the last call, I will use my time today to speak to the major drivers and events of the first quarter. This information is detailed in our consolidated report which is posted to our website and we would be happy to address any specific questions in the Q&A or after the call. As Chuck said, this morning we reported strong 2015 first quarter operating earnings of $0.62 per share which compares to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, basic and diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.53 per share, compared to 2014 first quarter basic earnings of $0.50 per share, or $0.49 per share on a diluted basis. We\u2019re off to a good start for the year. First quarter 2015 operating earnings were fairly plain and simple. As expected, we benefited from improvements in our competitive business, as well as increased transmission revenue, which were partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate in our corporate segment. From the standpoint of our first quarter guidance, we came in above the range we provided largely due to the impact on our distribution business of extremely cold weather in late February and March. Compared to the normal weather that we include in our guidance, first quarter wires revenue benefited by $0.06 per share as a result of heating degree days that were 21% above normal during the period. This was offset by about $0.03 per share related to weather impacts at our competitive business. First quarter operating earnings also benefited by a net $0.03 per share, compared to guidance primarily as a result of the New Jersey storm amortization delay and incremental revenue from a TrAIL transmission investment. Overall distribution deliveries increased slightly compared to last year, reflecting weather as well as modest growth in our customer base, offset by the impact of lower average customer use associated with energy efficiency. Residential sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2014 but down 1.7% on a weather adjusted basis while both actual and weather adjusted commercial sales increased slightly. Industrial sales were also up slightly marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in that sector. While soft natural gas prices are deterring some new entrants into the shale gas fields, our conservative estimates continue to support more than 1000 megawatts of new load for midstream businesses through 2019. The shale slowdown contributed the softer first quarter demand from the steel sector, however, most of the other key sectors on our region remains solid. In our transmission business, first quarter operating earnings were $0.17 per share, reflecting incremental rate base growth at both ATSI and TrAIL and forward looking rates at ATSI beginning January 1st this year, partially offset by higher depreciation taxes and interest expense. As Chuck described, our competitive business was able to more effectively navigate this year's extreme weather conditions due to the changes we began putting in place during the second quarter of last year. Our 2015 first quarter operating results in this business reflect the benefits of this repositioning and improved plant availability as well as higher capacity revenues. For 2015, our committed sales currently are about 70 million megawatt-hours. Essentially having sold everything, we anticipated on a retail and forward wholesale basis with over 8 million megawatt-hours available for spot wholesale sales over the remainder of the year. For 2015, we are also reducing our generation production estimate from about 79 million megawatt-hours, down to about 72 million megawatt-hours due to the economic and market conditions we experienced during the first quarter and the market price outlook for the balance of 2015. If it is more economic for us to purchase power from the market to serve low when needed, we will do so. But we have the benefit of our own generating resources if and when we need to call on them. Ultimately, market conditions will determine how much we generate from the fleet and how much we purchase. Essentially, we will source the power to meet our retail load obligations as economically as possible. For 2016, approximately 70% of our projected sales are committed. Based on our results for the first quarter, we are reaffirming our 2015 adjusted EBITDA arrange for the competitive business of $875 million to $950 million, as well as our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range of $750 million to $850 million. Consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year, the corporate consolidated effective tax rate was 38.8% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This change drove an $0.08 per share decrease in the corporate segment compared to last year and reflects the elimination of certain future tax liabilities associated with basis differences in the first quarter of 2014. This year is off to a solid start and we are executing our plans to improve our company's fundamentals and drive long-term shareholder value through customer focus, regulated growth. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share and are also providing a second quarter operating earnings range of $0.42 to $0.50 per share. With that, I'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Dan Eggers : Good morning, guys. Chuck Jones : Good morning, Dan. Dan Eggers : Good morning. Just following up on the cost cutting plan, thanks to the additional detail. But could we, maybe dig a little bit more into where you are seeing those buckets of savings maybe between regulated, non-regulated and kind of the scaling of those opportunities as you get further into the plan? Chuck Jones : Well. Dan, let me say it this way. I think, I said in my remarks that we are going to be focused primarily on the generation business. We are going to look at everything. The reason that the scope is excited about $2.5 billion dollars is because there are certain buckets of expenditures that would be counterproductive to our regulated growth strategy to go and try to address those. For example, our transmission expansion plan. So we're focusing primarily on generation. We are very cognizant of the fact that we don't want to do anything to take the growth strategy in our regulated companies off-track. Dan Eggers : And if we were to think about what that does to inflation, are these -- what is the underlying O&M inflation going to be your net of these savings? Is that the right way to think about kind of forward? Chuck Jones : I'm not sure I understand your question. Dan Eggers : So, I guess if you think about, are these savings going to be net reductions in O&M year-by-year or is there a level of inflation that will eat up some of the savings as we think about \u201916, \u201917, \u201818 numbers? Chuck Jones : Well, I think that initially, this is going to be a step down in our cost structure. And like any business over time, there are incremental adjustments that are made, as we offer our employee wage increases as there are inflationary things that go on in the economy. But one thing to keep in mind is we have not included staffing in this phase of what we're doing. We will have annually about a thousand employee attritions each year. And going forward, we expect to make adjustments in the structure of our organization such that those attritions should pretty much offset any inflationary pressures that are on where we are at when this project\u2019s done. Dan Eggers : Okay. And I guess one other topic. With the Supreme Court hopefully addressing the 745 case on Monday, can you just talk about what the process would be from a legal perspective for you guys if the Supreme Court takes the case or if they choose not to take the case? Chuck Jones : Leila can. Leila Vespoli : Okay. So if they choose to take the case, then I would expect folks to continue to drive capacity performance. They've already rejected its premature PJM\u2019s attempt to modify the DR process. So it would continue as a supply product as it has in the past and wait for some final determination from the Supreme Court, substantive determination with regard to demand response. If they decide to not take the case, I can speak to what in theory should happen. In theory what should happen, demand response should come out of the capacity auction as a supply product. From our standpoint, we believe there is a place for a demand response. We believe that that is on the side of state implementation plans and we think going forward that would be a useful product and can still be maintained. With regard to how PJM views it, we know they view that as a very valuable product. So I would imagine at a practical level, PJM will be seeking to somehow reinclude demand response within the capacity auction. Dan Eggers : Is it going to be practical, if they don\u2019t take the case and they have to go to this removal of DR? A, is a practical that it can be reasonably well addressed for this upcoming auction and then what is your view on whether retroactively prior auctions need to be adjusted? Leila Vespoli : So we still have our case out there that had challenged the prior base residual auction. Work has been -- has put them on the backburner, has not addressed that. I would anticipate they are going to need to do something with regard to that too. So with regard to that auction anyway, there is some question as to what would happen and whether it would be appropriate in our view to take demand response out, take out the price suppression effects associated with demand response and not rerun the auction but just remove the effects of demand response. Dan Eggers : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Brian Chin : Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Brian. Brian Chin : With the cost cut commentary today, does that preclude now the need to issue equity for the foreseeable future, particularly given some of the FFO to debt metrics that some of the credit rating agencies are looking at? Chuck Jones : Here's what I've said on that topic. All along I believe that it's incumbent on us to find a way to fundamentally operate our company in a way to where we don't have to use equity to strengthen our balance sheet. I think these cost cutting initiatives will get us to a place where we can be successful in not having to do. Then going forward, I think where equity should be used is words intended to be used in our business and that is to generate growth in our business. So we may look at equity down the road to use for growth either an additional transmission investment or potentially even investment inside the distribution companies. But I believe we can get ourselves to a position where the cost cutting puts us at the bottom end of the range that we need to be. And from a credit metrics perspective and then these costs over time, we will continue to improve the balance sheet. Brian Chin : Great. And also of the cost cuts and cash flow improvements, I think you said a $100 million of this was expenses and the remainder is cash flow improvements. Can you talk about on the cash flow side how much of that is just timing related as opposed to permanent reductions or permanent improvements in cash flow I should say? Chuck Jones : I don't think we can even talk about that right now. We just kicked this team off a few weeks back. We were in the early stages of it. I think when we get to this point at the end of the second quarter, I think I will be in a good position to tell you more concretely what we've identified and what the ongoing impact on our company is going to be. Brian Chin : Okay. And then last point, then I'll jump back. The cost cuts that you\u2019ve got there embedded in the current EBITDA guidance, I thought I heard you say that, but I just want to confirm. Chuck Jones : No, they are not. Brian Chin : They are not. Chuck Jones : They are targets at this point. Once we know what they are, then we will embed them in our going forward forecast that we give you. Brian Chin : Very good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning. First the question on, you mentioned the supplemental testimony you\u2019re going to file on Monday I guess. Could you just give us a little sense, more color on what areas you might be focusing on with that? Leila Vespoli : Hi, Steve. This is Leila. We will be addressing the factors that the Commission laid out in the APKs, while we think our underlying case actually did cover all of those. Since the Commission gave us an opportunity to supplement our testimony, we are availing ourselves of that. So just if you think about them, they were financials, need, supply diversity, comply with environmental regulations, jobs, economic development, and then kind of going down the lift. So we will be supplementing our testimony in all those regards. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thanks. Separate question, just to clarify something on the equity issuance question before. So to degree that you would look at equity funds for growth investment, would that only be for investment that goes beyond your current capital plan or could it be fund investment that\u2019s already in your current capital plan? Chuck Jones : Well, Steve, I think we need to see where we end up with this initiative first and foremost and where that leaves us in terms of free cash flow once that\u2019s done. But I would say my goal is to use equity for new growth on top of the growth that we've already communicated to you. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Good. And then last question just in terms of the transmission, my recollection is that you\u2019re going to be reserving for kind of -- some kind of ROE adjustment in transmission. And I don\u2019t know if there is anything color you can give on what you\u2019re assuming there after something in your Q or something on that? Chuck Jones : So here is what I would say on that, we have been approved for a forward-looking formula rate at 12.38%. We are doing what we believe is prudent to go forward, but I think we\u2019re approaching those negotiations in the settlement process from that perspective. And for me to give you anything else, I think we\u2019re negotiating against ourselves at this point and I'm not prepared to do that. So we'll see where this process unfolds, but I think FERC approved us at 12.38% and we\u2019re going to negotiate from there. Steve Fleishman : Okay, but you\u2019re reserving something? Chuck Jones : No. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Neel Mitra from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Neel Mitra : Hi, good morning. Leila Vespoli : Hi, Neel. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Neel Mitra : First question on JCP&L, now that you have the rate case resolved, obviously it was off of a 2011 test year. So you\u2019re not getting up to that authorized ROE, how soon could you refile to try to get the liabilities between authorized and earned? Leila Vespoli : Hi, Neel. Actually from the rate order, we are required to file the rate case by April 2017, but as we always do we continue to look at that and I might expect to filing even sooner than that timeframe. Chuck Jones : But one of the things we want to do here is we haven\u2019t really been able to sit down and talk with the BPU commissioners for almost three years now. And the President and I have talked and we are going to get together and talk about the future of JCP&L together before we get to a point where then we can\u2019t talk again. So that\u2019s the game plan. Neel Mitra : Great. And then Jim, I wanted to go back to your comments about possibly reducing the amount of terawatt hours that comes out of the fleet in 2015 and I'm not sure if it was 2016 as well. In 2015, would it be a margin benefit just because you\u2019re purchasing power at cheaper cost and generating or the actual kilowatt hours coming down for stuff that you haven\u2019t hedged and does that also affect 2016 as well? Jim Pearson : Neel, what we\u2019re looking at is, it would be a margin benefit, because we would be looking at buying power cheaper than what we would produce it at. Neel Mitra : So, would be for the hedge portion, I guess, in 2015, what about 2016? Jim Pearson : Yes. Neel Mitra : Have you commented on kilowatt hours generation for that. Jim Pearson : Yeah. We have that broken out in the fact book, Neel. I don\u2019t have the exact number right of the top of my head. But, yeah, we would have it out there. But in 2016, we\u2019re going to look at running in and dispatching the plans no differently than we are right now, if it\u2019s cheaper to buy from the market that\u2019s what we will do. Neel Mitra : Great. And then, just generally speaking, as far as some investment for the super supercritical to be CP compliance. Is there any general color you can give us as to how your fleet is positioned going into the auction in hopefully August? Chuck Jones : Well, I think, we need to see first where FERC and PJM land in terms of a capacity performance product being in the auction. Then we need to sit down and take a look at how are we going to approach that auction from a bidding strategy. Then we need to see what units clear and at what price they clear and then from there we\u2019ll decide what the appropriate investment in our unit is to make sure that they\u2019re available when they need to be. So there are a lot of unanswered questions and there\u2019s a lot of competitive implications around how we\u2019re going to approach to that I prefer not to get into the details. So but we understand that there is the potential that we may want to do some additional investment in our fleet, but that all depends on where these rules shake out and where the market ultimately clears that. Neel Mitra : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Chuck Jones : Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, so just following-up with little clarity on New Jersey. Does it necessarily need to be a rate case for say in the medium term? Specifically, what I\u2019m curious about is, is there any potential for like a stimulus like program like we\u2019ve seen at some of the peers in New Jersey versus or in conjunction with the rate case? Chuck Jones : Well, as I said, we haven\u2019t had a chance to really have meaningful dialogue with the BPU for three years. We\u2019re going to go over there and have meaningful dialogue. Once we have that, I\u2019ll be able to answer that question a little better. It's an option that we would obviously be willing to consider it, if they willing to consider it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then with regard to the disk in Pennsylvania, you\u2019ve been parting with the idea for a while. What do you need to see happen there or what\u2019s the ambiguity or [ambigulance] [ph] in pursuing that structure? Chuck Jones : Well, I wouldn\u2019t say, we\u2019ve been flirting with it. We had a major hurdle we had to get through, which is the base rate cases for all of those companies, which we are now through. And now what I've done is I've asked our energy delivery team to look at what investments make sense for customers inside those operating companies. And I\u2019ve pretty consistently said, I\u2019m going to go invest money where it make sense for customers. So until we see exactly company by company what the needs are to drive reliability improvement and improve customer service, I can\u2019t answer that. I think, I've said that we could spend up to about $440 million in Pennsylvania and stay under the 5% cap. I don't see it\u2019s going anywhere near that number in the first disk filing that we would make, if we make one. But we\u2019re putting that business case together right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then finally on the GenCo real quickly. In light of the latest trend of cost cuts, are you still generally targeting a cash flow breakeven outlook for that company? Is that kind of the right way to think about it at a high level? Chuck Jones : Well, that business\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: \u2026cost cut to get you there. Chuck Jones : That business is cash flow positive for the next four years without any of these cash flow improvements. So anything that we accomplish is going to make it more cash flow positive and its going to make FirstEnergy more -- improve FirstEnergy's overall cash flow and that what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. So we\u2019re already cash flow positive for that business for the next four years. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Just looking -- just going over a few of these questions. I\u2019m afraid I was a little bit but completely clear on. When I look at the fact book and we talked about it, it was Neel\u2019s question on the generation output. I don\u2019t see any significant change post 2015 in terms of you guy\u2019s expectation. And I just wanted to make sure I understood this correctly. I mean, do you guys because of what\u2019s happened with the power prices and the forward groups, do you see any change in what your output might be? I just want to, just make sure I understand. Donny Schneider : Yeah. Paul, this is Donny. Yeah. From 2016 with the forwards that are out there, we\u2019re still projecting no change to what we\u2019ve shown in previous fact books. The fact of the matter is, at today\u2019s forwards we\u2019re kind of right on the edge. And so almost literally a dollar change in the forwards would move, whether we dispatch a unit or we don\u2019t dispatch a unit. But for now what we\u2019re seeing in \u201816 is that our units will run as we\u2019ve forecasted previously. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. Thanks for clarity. And then also on I think, Dan\u2019s question on as for the FERC. Leila, you said that if Supreme Court did take up the auction, I think you said that -- take up the case, excuse me, that you wouldn\u2019t seek to rerun the auction but you would want to take out the effects. Could you elaborate a little bit more on that? Are you seeing that you just have the auction reprised or what do you actually mean by that? Leila Vespoli : No. I don\u2019t think they misunderstood what I said. What FERC has done, PJM came to FERC and asked to consider DR on the demand side of the equation and FERC told them they were pretty mature in that. So the Supreme Court takes up the case. The chance exist that demand response might still be under FERC jurisdiction. And I think that what FERC was looking at. So right now the way it would I think play out is demand response would be in the BRA auction when it\u2019s held presumably in the middle of August. And would be a supply side item as it has been in the past. Paul Patterson : Okay. But if it wasn\u2019t in the -- if the Supreme Court did not take it out, would you seek to have the previous auction? I think you suggested that the previous auction you want to \u2026 Chuck Jones : Boomerang. Paul Patterson : What do you mean by not having the auctions rerun but having them the effect taken out it think it\u2019s the way I understand it to be? Leila Vespoli : Right. So flashing back to last year when we held the BRA and we filed the complaint with FERC, what we suggested was if demand response is not under FERC jurisdiction than what the remedy should be is just to remove demand or response from the supply side and then you can still stack up from how the auction was. What would\u2019ve happened if demand was not been taken but other generators would\u2019ve been taken. So you take out price suppression effect but you don\u2019t have to -- nobody has to rebid everything back into the auction. Paul Patterson : Okay. I see. Okay. Thanks so much for that. And then on JCP&L there is this review that's going on, that I think they are trying to do some audit or something which is little unusual since you just had your proceedings. But they themselves are seeking to review you guys. Could you talk about that and how that relates to the potential for? I mean, could you just address that, I guess, and what you think about that in this whole idea about the lag and everything else that you talked about? Chuck Jones : Well, first of all, I would say this we are not afraid of any audit of JCP&L\u2019s operations I'm confident that that when they do this review, they are going to see a JCP&L that is much different than the JCP&L they saw the last time that they did a review. The reason for it is as a result of the 2011 and 2012 storms. There were reliability issues that kind of crept in to the rate case and there was no adequate mechanism within the rate case to deal with the reliability issues. So coming out of the rate case, this is a way that kind of put those reliability issues behind us and position us as I said where we can now work with the BPU to move forward together. Paul Patterson : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman : Good morning. Your had a great quarter with respect to transmission. I just wonder appreciating that you don't want to negotiate with yourself during the settlement proceedings but I believe this was the first quarter you got forward rate making mechanism at TrAIL, TrAILCo. Can you separate that out the $0.09? I mean how much was due to the forward mechanism and how much was due to fact that you\u2019ve been very busy with CapEx the past year? Chuck Jones : First off, it\u2019s ATSI that we filed further, not TrAIL. Charles Fishman : Okay. Chuck Jones : And as a result of those filing, what you are essentially seeing is the investments that we made in 2014 were made in a kind of the old formula rate. So for the first quarter of this year, you are seeing kind of a compound impact of everything that we invested in \u201814 because the rate went into effect as well as the first quarter investments that we\u2019ve made. So in those overall results, the difference between a 12.38% return in any other subsequent return that we might end up at is minimal and that's why we say we reserved a small amount but we are moving forward with a 12.38% return until somebody tells that it\u2019s a different return. And I believe there is a very strong case to be made that if there is a different return, it should be different going forward from the point where there\u2019s a settlement not reverse, so. Charles Fishman : Okay. So the settlement negotiations are really over the ROE not over the forward rate making mechanism, correct? Leila Vespoli : This is Leila. We really can\u2019t comment on what\u2019s being discussed in the settlement. But I think, given the position of ROE in the grand scheme of things, you can derive your own conclusions with regard to that. Charles Fishman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashar Khan from Visium. Please proceed with your question. Ashar Khan : First of all, great results and my questions have been answered. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Real quick and this one maybe more for Jim. Just looking at the short-term debt balances, seem that those went up a little bit. What\u2019s your plan in terms of whether you\u2019ll maintain that short-term debt balance outstanding for a good while or whether you have the capability to pay it down or will you think about either terming it out or doing something else with it to reduce long-term interest rate exposure? Jim Pearson : We wait to see where we come out on these initiatives as Chuck talked about, Michael. We have some significant opportunity in the cash flow improvement project that Chuck talked and then a couple of the other big items that we are still looking at the capacity performance and the PPA. We don't have any plans right now to term any of that debt out. We will continue to look at it. The first quarter\u2019s a little bit unusual from cash flow output. We generally prepay our Pennsylvania gross receipts tax. That's about a $177 million. We had a pension contribution that we made in the first quarter. Ohio property taxes are due in the first and third quarter and generally, our benefit plans perhaps are in the first quarter. So it\u2019s a bit of an abnormal. I would expect that over the rest of the year we would not see that balance to grow. In fact, we may reduce that somewhat. But we will continue to look at whether it makes sense to terminate it out. I would prefer as time goes on, to push that further down into the business units, have the debt closer to the asset. But I think we\u2019ve got to wait to see where we come out on some of these initiatives before we make that final decision. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hugh Wynne from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Hugh Wynne : Hi. I just wanted to congratulate you and encourage you on this effort to improve quality of earnings. And I wanted to ask question regarding that. One of the distinct aspects of your operating earnings presentation as I understand it, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, is that unlike your GAAP earnings where the difference between expected returns on pension assets and realized returns on pension assets is recognized every year in the fourth quarter. In operating earnings, there\u2019s actually no recognition of that difference. And I estimate that over the last five years that difference of expected returns over actual returns on pension assets has been something like $570 million, which works out to an average of about a $115 million a year or $0.27 a share. So, I was -- my question then is, are you thinking of ways in which you could perhaps reflect more accurately in operating earnings the outcome of your pension investments? Charles Jones : Hugh, we made that decision a number of years ago to record any changes in actuarial assumptions on a mark-to-market basis. In our ongoing operating results, we have all of the service costs in there and then just any changes in the actuarial assumptions. And the biggest piece of that is generally the change in the discount rate, which has fallen over the last few years. So, we have no intention of changing the way we report our pension and our operating earnings going forward. But we fully break that out and much you know what the discount rate and the actual return on the assets. Hugh Wynne : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thanks you. Our next question today is coming from with [Paul Fremont from Nexus] [ph]. Please proceed with your question. Paul Fremont : Thank you very much. Really two things. One, can you give us any type of update on potential discussion that you are having in Ohio. I think at one point, you had mentioned that some other parties have expressed an interest in talking to you subsequent to the AP decision? Charles Jones : Well, I would say that we\u2019re always in discussions with the parties that are intervening. And we\u2019re not in discussions with the commission because we can't be. And when we have something to tell you, we\u2019ll tell you. Paul Fremont : And then I guess the other question is half of the $2.6 billion, I think represented fuel which I think is more unique to the generation side. But the other half looks like it could be potential savings that when applied to other segments within the company. You sort of ruled out transmission, but any possible application of that saving to the distribution side? Chuck Jones : Well, what I ruled out is anything that would have a negative impact on our regulated growth strategy. So we just had rate cases in a number of our operations. It would be counterproductive there, if we\u2019re looking at going forward to make additional an investments inside those utilities. So what I ruled out is anything -- used transmission as an example, but what I ruled out is anything that impacts our regulated growth strategy. Paul Fremont : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Hi. All my questions had been answered. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Stephen. Leila Vespoli : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : In your initial remarks you had mentioned, one of the contributors to 1Q performance was -- I think it was more rigorous economic dispatch of the generation unit. I wonder if you could just expand in terms of how you approached this year versus prior period. Chuck Jones : Why don\u2019t I let Donny take it, but as I\u2019ve told you, our goal is to run the competitive business overall little more conservatively so that we can have predictable results and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to achieve. And obviously, what I talked about is effective last year there was a polar vortex this year in February. There was what they term the Siberian Express which was actually more severe weather and a higher PGM peak load. And I think that we were able to capitalize on some of that weather improvement that we get on the utility side by doing what I said. And that is our operating our generating business much more conservatively and part of that is we\u2019re not going to dispatch units into a price that they don't make money, if we can avoid doing that. So Donny, you want to fill in any details or? Donny Schneider : Yes. Stephen, I\u2019d just to say, we\u2019ve had a long history of this kind of thing. If you recall back in 2009 timeframe when the market first collapsed, we took our Lake plants offline, we took that workforce out of the Lake plants, and we moved them into the regulated side of business. Summer of 2012 we took Sammis Plant offline to get offline for about three to four months and then ultimately brought it back online. What we have now that's different than what we\u2019ve had in the past. There is a lot more freeboard. When you have that open position into the spot market, you're able to take advantage of the market much more readily than what we have had in the past, because we have a cushion there from a risk perspective. So when you look back at this previous quarter, we had our Mansfield Plant completely offline for about a straight week when the price was below our marginal cost. Stephen Byrd : Okay. Understood. That makes sense. And then just touching on the performance during the winter, it sounds like this winter you all have a much better operational performance. We talked a little bit in the past about this, but just curious how can you -- can you talk about the sort of changes you\u2019ve had year-over-year and how you physically manage the fleet for weather risk and how that positions you going forward? Chuck Jones : Well, the biggest difference between January 14 and this year was we had a generator step-up transformer failure at Beaver Valley 1. And that is a -- it was not a weather related event even though the temperature outside might have been 17 below zero. The temperature inside that transformer is around 75 degree to 90 degree C, so it was a random failure that just happened to occur at the worst time that it could possibly occur. So that was the biggest impact on 2014. Beyond that, we took some steps to harden if you will some of the equipment that is outdoors, and subject to weather our power plants that could lead to a disruption in unit performance. But there wasn't a whole lot of significant work and expenditures necessary to do that. And I'll just tell you that the teamwork between our Commodity Group and our generation fleet was exceptional this winter and that also led to the type of results that we were able to accomplish. Stephen Byrd : Thank you very much. Chuck Jones : Okay. Well, I think that was the last question. So we want to thank you all for your support. Obviously, I think we had a pretty good quarter, it was influenced by the weather and I\u2019m not going to take credit for the weather, because we've got July and August come in. And if it goes the other way, I\u2019m not going to take blame for the weather either. But it was a good start to the year. If you dig down below that, our operational performance was right on schedule with what we're trying to accomplish. And I know one quarter doesn't make a trend, but you have to start with one before you can get to 10 or 12. So that's our game plan and we thank you all for your support. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

And welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp.\u2019s Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy. Thank you. You may now begin. Meghan Beringer : Thanks, Brandon, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from this indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website. Participating in today\u2019s call are Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets and Chief Legal Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Don Moul, Vice President, Commodity Operations; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share an update on what has been a very busy and productive period for FirstEnergy. We're continuing to make steady progress on our strategic initiatives, we are achieving closure on several of the industry issues that impact our company and we reported very strong financial results for the second quarter. Our efforts to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service driven growth remained on track and I'm optimistic about our future. During my remarks today, I will review a number of recent developments and give you a sense of what we are expects for the rest of the year. Following my comments and Jim's review of our financial and operating results, we will have plenty of time for your questions. Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.53 per share, which is $0.03 above the top of the range we provided in May. These results were higher -- these results were driven by higher earnings and Transmission business and the benefits of our more conservative strategy in our Competitive business. We continue to make solid progress on energizing the future Transmission initiative, which as you know is expected to be the primary driver of our growth over the next several years. During the second quarter we completed the project design to support service reliability following the plant deactivations in Northern Ohio and we continue our work to upgrade and strengthen the grid in the ATSI region and support midstream gas operations. We remained on pace to invest $970 million in our Transmission business during 2015 with about 60% of this investment already complete. This year, we have also put into place the framework to ensure more timely recovery for our Transmission investments. In January, we moved to a forward-looking formula rates structure for ATSI and on July 20th we filed FERC a settlement agreement that maintained at ATSI\u2019s ROE at 12.38% for the first six months of this year. Under this settlement, which remains subject to FERC approval the rate adjust to 11.06% for the second half of this year and then the 10.38% beginning January 1, 2016, until at least January 1, 2018. The average ROE for the three-year period would be 10.83%. We're pleased to reach this settlement as it reflects the current Transmission ROE environment and allows us to move forward with our energizing the future Transmission investment plan for customers, while ensuring timely recovery for the company. We expect approval from FERC later this year. In June we filed requests for authorization to transfer Transmission assets owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L into a new Transmission affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. These assets represent approximately $900 million in rate based as of the end of 2014. If approved by FERC, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, MAIT will operate similarly to our two existing Transmission subsidiaries ATSI and TrAILCo. We expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for customers of our Eastern utility companies, similar to what we're doing for customers connected to our ATSI Transmission system. We're seeking approval from FERC in six months and from the State Commissions by mid-2016, prior to closing the transaction MAIT will file for new Transmission rates with FERC. In May, I outlined three key initiatives that will shape our company going forward. These are the cash flow improvement project, PJM capacity market reforms and our Ohio ESP. Let's start with the results of our cash flow improvement project. I'm pleased to report that we expect this project to result in cash flow improvement of $58 million in 2015, $155 million in 2016 and $240 million in 2017, exceeding the original targets for all three years. We launched this project in April with the goal of capturing both immediate and long-term savings that are meaningful and sustainable. We have completed a thorough analysis of savings and process improvements that do not compromise our ability to serve the needs of our organization, our customers and our employees, and we are now moving forward to implement these plans. These improvements come primarily from our competitive and corporate functions. The largest categories include reducing expenses and capital at our competitive fleet, particularly at our sub-critical fossil units, reducing fossil fuel and fuel-related commodity expenses, and taking advantage of attrition across the company and implemented a selective hiring program. There are also nearly 100 smaller items that collectively make a strong impact. About 65% of this savings are expected from operating expenses and 35% are from capital and nuclear fuel improvements over the three-year period. On page 170 of our FactBook, which was posted on our website last evening, we include more details on the cash flow initiative. We've already begun the implementation process, in fact, the majority of the fuel savings that we identified have already been locked in and the new contract pricing will begin in September. We have also establish a project management office to ensure we capture these savings and are fully committed to successfully executing this plan and establishing a new foundation for FirstEnergy going forward. We believe it will result in a stronger and more flexible company with an improve balance sheet overtime. Turning to capacity market reforms, during the quarter FERC approved PJM\u2019s new capacity performance rules and as you know FERC issued an order last week allowing demand response and energy efficiency resources into the transitional auctions. Importantly, the base residual auction remains on track and is still scheduled to begin August 10th. The 2016-17 and 2017-18 transitional auctions were delayed slightly and are now scheduled to begin on August 26th and September 3rd, respectively. Before I move from general -- generation, let's quickly touch on the Supreme Court decision regarding MATS. While the EPA regulations remain in effect pending further judicial proceedings before the DC Circuit Court, I want to be clear that FirstEnergy is not contemplating reopening any of the units representing 4,769 megawatts of generation that were closed due to cost of compliance with the MATS regulations. For our remaining fleet we have already spent a significant portion of the $370 million in capital expenditures for equipment upgrades that were required under MATS and many projects are complete or underway. In our competitive generation fleet, we identified a total cost of $178 million to comply with the regulations, of which $62 million had been spent through June 30th of this year. At our regulated fleet, the cost estimate was $192 million, with $105 million of that spent through June 30th. I will also mention that we are moving forward with all aspects of the construction of the new dewatering facility for our 2400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield Plant in Pennsylvania. While the plant is still pressured by current market conditions, we believe moving forward with constructions as prudent to ensure that these megawatts remain available to serve customers in 2017 after our disposal rights at Little Blue Run expire. As we've previously mentioned, all costs associated with this project are in our current capital plan. Finally, let's move to our Ohio and our Electric Security Plan. Based on the current procedural schedule, staff testimony is due August 14, with hearings to begin at the end of the month. As you would expect, we remain very engaged in this process. We filed supplemental testimony in early May to further emphasize the factors that the Ohio commission outlined in the AEP and Duke cases. It is telling that the public utilities that serve the majority of customers in the state agree conceptually on an appropriate transition plan for the future that ensure safe, reliable, clean and affordable power for all Ohio customers from industrial facilities to homeowners. Given the plan\u2019s benefits, including the economic development support, we believe our filing meets the criteria outlined by the commission and will remain optimistic that this plan will result in sound state energy policy for our customers. We had a solid first half since the start of the year. We have made tremendous progress toward our goals of investing in customer focus growth supporting sound energy policy and strengthening our company from within. We know there is still work to be done to position FirstEnergy for the future. At this point, we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 a share to $2.70 a share, with all three of our operating segments turning favorably versus their midpoints. We\u2019re comfortable guiding to the top of this range. We expect to refine guidance on the third quarter call, once we have seen the full effects of the summer weather. Collectively, the cash flow improvement initiative, upcoming capacity auction results and Ohio ESP decision will drive the near-term financial strategy of our company and give us a much clearer view of the next three years, including earnings and cash flow and a determination on additional equity, if any, to drive growth in our regulated businesses. In addition, we have already begun our robust annual planning process, which includes updating projections for all of our utilities, especially now that we have the three major rate cases behind us. This effort will help us further refine our distribution utility earnings profile going forward. Many of you have asked about the status of our analyst meeting. At this time, we still intend to hold it after the outcome of the Ohio ESP, which may push the meeting into early 2016. We look forward to providing you a comprehensive view of our future planning at that time. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our second quarter financial results. Jim Pearson : Thanks, Chuck and good morning, everyone. My prepared remarks will focus on the major drivers and events in the quarter. As you know, more details are available in the consolidated report that was posted on our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions either in the Q&A or following the call. Today we reported strong second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.53 per share, which compares to $0.49 per share last year. On a GAAP basis, basic earnings were $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP earnings were $0.16 per basic share during the same period last year. As Chuck mentioned, our operating earnings were above our targeted range for the quarter. Let\u2019s look at the results from each of our segments starting with the distribution business. Residential sales decreased seven-tenths of a percent overall compared to the second quarter of 2014 while commercial sales increased 1%. Adjusting for weather, residential deliveries were down 2.4% and commercial sales were flat. We are examining the residential usage trend, which has been down over the last four quarters on a weather-adjusted basis. We believe this is attributable to energy efficiency as average customer usage has also declined quarter-over-quarter. In the industrial sector, sales decreased 1.1% in the quarter, handing a seven quarter run of increased demand from the customer class, primarily due to lower usage from the steel industry. The current rate of shale growth continues to be impacted by soft natural gas prices. While we still see support for more than 1000 megawatts of new load for midstream activities through 2019, our forecast reflects greater confidence in the 2015 and 2016 project, which represents about half of that load growth. Turning to our transmission business second quarter operating earnings increased $0.06 to-$0.21 per share as a result of revenue increases from a higher rate base at ATSI and a forward-looking rate structure that began in January. In our competitive business, operating earnings $0.01 per share compared to the same period last year, reflecting higher commodity margin associated with higher capacity revenues, a modest increase in wholesale sales and lower contract sales. Additionally, operating cost decreased year-over-year largely due to improved planned performance. As we said last quarter, we had essentially sold everything we anticipated for 2015 on a retail and forward wholesale basis, with a reserve of 5 million megawatt hours available for spot wholesales through the end of the year. For 2016, about 70% of our expected generation resources are committed and we are currently about 40% committed for 2017. Based on our results for the first half of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement initiative, we are reaffirming 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the comparative business of $875 million to $950 million and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range to $825 million to $925 million from $750 million to $850 million. It was another solid quarter for our company and this is shaping up to be a good year. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance and the trends we see so far this year, make us confident at the top end of that range at this point. We are committed to achieving the cash savings we have identified and to building long-term shareholder value through our customer focused regulated growth strategy. Now, with that, I\u2019d like to open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Dan Eggers : Hey, good morning guys. Chuck Jones : Hi Dan. Dan Eggers : Hey Chuck, thanks for the additional detail on the cash flow improvement slides. I guess, in sense of being greedy, two questions, one, what do you see for opportunities, going forward. Can those numbers grow as you kind of get further into the process of evaluation? And then, two, can you talk a little bit of how you really get searched big flow savings out of suppliers, who seem to be pretty in financial dire straits at this point? Chuck Jones : Well, I\u2019ll take the first question and then I\u2019ll hand the second part of it off to Don Moul to answer. And on the first one, I do think there are some opportunities for us to add to this over time, particularly in the supply chain area, we set a 12-week timeframe to complete this study. We can operate it at that speed but our suppliers don\u2019t unnecessarily operate at that speed. So we\u2019ve got a number of items in the queue that we\u2019re still working on to try to get it across the finish line. So I think there is some opportunity to improve this over time. And I\u2019ll let Don to tackle your fuel question. Don Moul : Yeah. Thanks Chuck. And so when you take a look at the CFIP savings as you noted, Dan. One of the most significant savings in the initiative comes from reduction in the fossil fuel cost. And that sort of savings is about $151 million, that kind of breaks out as follows, about half or $75 million of the savings is really a result of working with our coal suppliers to get reduced rates. And then we got about $50 million associated with the refined coal process, where we partnered with several third parties to produce the coal that reduces emissions. We have a contractual relationship, where we paid for every kind of coal that\u2019s treated and the third party receives a tax credit under Sector 45 of the tax code. These contracts are now in place with Sammis and Mansfield Field through 2021, and we are in the final steps of negotiating for Pleasants. The balance, which is about $25 million, is driven from several smaller writing items, including reagent and waste disposal costs. And as Chuck said, these are already under contract. So that\u2019s part of the write-down of the savings and clearly the coal suppliers are in tight market times as well as we are. We found opportunities to build on our relationships. We\u2019ve got good relationships with our coal suppliers and our transportation suppliers. We meet with them twice a year to work through these market challenges and try to find ways that we can partner in a win-win kind of an approach. So we have been successful so far. We look forward to working with them in the future. Chuck Jones : I will just follow on the second there, because I know I am going to get this question later. The savings we were able to achieve in the fuel supply, particularly related to the Bruce Mansfield Plant, were a big factor in our decision to move forward with the dewatering facility, makes that plant more competitive starting September 1. Dan Eggers : Okay. Got it. I guess, can we turn to the Ohio PPA structure and kind of it keeps getting pushed out from a time perspective? Should we read anything to maybe some change in tone at the governor level or at the commission level, if they are interested in doing this? And then do you see any risk to may be interest changing once EPA comes to the carbon rules or once RPM gets out there? Chuck Jones : I will let Leila to take it and then I may follow on. Leila Vespoli : Okay. Thanks, Chuck. Hi, Dan. I think the delay in the hearing was in response to the commission desire to get additional data points with regard to what\u2019s happening with the EPA, but I think more precisely what\u2019s happening with the capacity performance. I don\u2019t think that that should be the be-all end-all, I think those are data points, but I also think they are mindful of the fact that our current ESP ends the middle of next year. So there is not a lot of additional delays that could be tolerated within the schedule we need to meet. So I think we are in a good space right now with regard to the timing of it with hearing starting, August 31. One thing I would like to point out it was after the last call that we continue to be in negotiations. And since our last call, we were able to add [IU] [ph] with the non-opposing party and Kroger as a signed party. So I think what is presented to the commission is a very robust settlement. I am still very hopeful that we will be able to move forward in a very positive way. And as always, we continue to try and bring additional parties on board. Chuck Jones : So to your question on how does it tie into the clean power plant and other things that are on, I don\u2019t think we have time to wait to see how all of those shake out. There is a sense of urgency here I think around these two facilities in particular that we\u2019ve got to get a decision made about them. So obviously, we are anxious to keep it moving forward. Dan Eggers : And just to clarify the timeline is, the hearings are August 31, can you just walk through the -- Leila maybe the steps in there to where final resolution should play out if it goes through litigators without a settlement? Leila Vespoli : So at this point, I would like to say we would get it done by the end of the year, but I am thinking it might slip into the very first part of next year, so early 2016 for a final decision. Dan Eggers : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead with your questions. Neel Mitra : Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Neel. Neel Mitra : The transmission business seems to be doing well. And I think in the past, you mentioned that maybe about a $1 billion is the maximum you can spend a year. Is that number still right? Or could you deploy additional capital beyond that $1 billion if the process goes well and the Pennsylvania utilities are included in the transfers? Chuck Jones : Well, I think there are several factors. We\u2019ve communicated our plans for the next several years and they amount to about a $1 billion a year. Meg will provide additional opportunities if we\u2019re successful in getting it done. Our transmission infrastructure has aged, and we\u2019ve talked about a queue of projects that could potentially go on for a long time at the rate of a $1 billion a year. So I think at that point in time, we would look at it, but I think a determining factor is the ability to resource additional construction. There is a shortage of transmission alignment around our country and that would be a factor in terms of expanding it to any significant amount I think. Neel Mitra : Got it. And then the second question on Davis-Besse and Sammis, obviously you need both the capacity auction and the PPA for the plants to be successful. How do you philosophically think about the strategy around bidding in the PJM without a PPA resolution in hand? Chuck Jones : Our attack is to bid those units as competitive units. That\u2019s what they are today. And I would just correct one thing you said, I don\u2019t think we need both. I think we need the PPAs. If we\u2019re successful there what happens in the capacity options, even though they are bid as competitive units that value will flow to customers once the PPA is approved. Neel Mitra : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions. Greg Orrill : Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on the appeals to the Supreme Court of Ohio of the AEP, PPA proposal whether that\u2019s relevant to -- whether you think that\u2019s relevant to your case at all and if you care to comment on whether you think the Supreme Court will take the case? Leila Vespoli : Greg, this is Leila. I think right now that those appeals are premature. There is still absolute hearing associated with that case in Ohio, I don\u2019t see how you get the Supreme Court to take those up when absolute hearing are pending. So I fully expect those cases, those appeals to be dismissed. Does it mean they can\u2019t refile them at a later date? But again I think they are prematured. So I don\u2019t think they are going to have any affect on our case. And with regard, I read some conjecture that if they went forward somehow things would be stayed in Ohio as the case is going before the Ohio Supreme Court, the decision goes forward, the commission decision goes forward and is not stayed unless a specific statutory provision is met. And under that provision, the party that is requesting the stay needs to provide and post the bond. So that\u2019s a very high hurdle to assume within the context of this type of cases. So again bottomline, no effect. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : A quick question on the transmission. Again you booked -- you are up I guess $0.11 in the first half of the year. Is there anything in those numbers for the settlements like, have you taken some kind of a charge against the lower ROE this quarter, or is that all to come in H2 when the things finalized? Chuck Jones : There wasn\u2019t a lower ROE this quarter. We got 12.3% in place for the first six months of 2015, which was a partial contributor to the better performance in the transmission segment. Jonathan Arnold : Just curious Chuck, whether you might have had to recognize the lower return that will come in the second half of the year ahead of time, but it sounds like none? Chuck Jones : No, we won\u2019t Jonathan. We will recognize those during the periods that they occur. Jonathan Arnold : So the moving part, as we think about the second half the transmission is higher rate base having the forward looking test year for the second half of the year and tempered somewhat by ROE? Chuck Jones : Yes. I would say Jonathan for the second half of year you won\u2019t see the robust growth that we saw in the first quarter. We were up $0.11 year-over-year. For the second quarter or for the second half of the year, you are going to have a much higher rate base that you\u2019re going to compare to in '15 compared to '14. In the first half of 2014 that rate base was based on December 2012 rate base and that carried through for the first five months and that was $683 million. When I look at the comparisons in the second half of 2014, that rate base was going to be about $922 million compared to $1.8 billion. And you are right. The ROE that was used for the second half of last year was 12.38%, and we will recognize 11.06% in the second half of 2015. With that said, I would expect that transmission will trend to the upper end of the range as we said most of our segments are. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. But still the mass, sort more of that, let\u2019s get to that when you add all those parts together. Chuck Jones : That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. So, thank you. Jim Pearson : Sorry. I just want to add. We are very happy with this settlement. We wouldn\u2019t have settled if we weren\u2019t and if you think about what we are doing $500 million of investment in our transmission business, the difference between 10.38% and 12.38%, adds to maybe $10 million, maybe a penny a half a share overall. But as we talked earlier, the forward-looking rate returns, cash in earnings back to the business faster and more timely given the way we are investing in smaller project to get done quickly. Chuck Jones : So, we can catch and we think they are getting the clarity on ROE is a big help too. So, I just wanted to understand the mass of bridging the second half. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Fleishman : Hi. Good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi, Chuck. Two questions. First, is there any schedule that\u2019s been said so far on the filing on the MAIT approvals, I guess particularly in the states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey? Leila Vespoli : So, right now interventions were due by July 10th. And right now, I don't see any further procedural schedules that with regard to that although we would expect a decision by December \u201915. Steve Fleishman : And that\u2019s in which state? Leila Vespoli : That will occur this year. I\u2019m sorry? Chuck Jones : Which state? Steve Fleishman : Where? Leila Vespoli : So that\u2019s with respect to FERC and then\u2026 Steve Fleishman : Got it, FERC. Okay. Leila Vespoli : \u2026to Pennsylvania, interventions on August 3rd. Pre-hearing conferences in -- sometime, August, September date and then a decision mid 2016. And with respect to New Jersey, there are no deadline interventions and we would expect an order again with regard to that by mid 2016. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Leila Vespoli : So, no specific hearing dates. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then is there a precedence in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for others that have been able to get kind of existing transmission, kind of separated out. Leila Vespoli : Yes. Part of our ATSI assets in Pennsylvania. And I believe there are others although they are not on top of mind right now. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Leila Vespoli : There is rail. Chuck Jones : And power operating company is part of ATSI. Steve Fleishman : Great. And then just the clarification on the comment on equity. I think you again said that you only would consider equity to a degree that there would be additional growth beyond your current capital plans. Is that correct? Chuck Jones : What I said in my remarks is once we have -- we've got the cash flow improvements. Once we have the results of capacity performance and once we know where we are at with the ATSI, then we'll look at whether there's an application for equity to stimulate growth both in transmission and distribution if any. So all along, I do not want to have to use equity to repair our credit metrics and strengthen the balance sheet. That's why we implemented the CFIT project. I think we made substantial progress there as that starts to flow through to strengthening our balance sheet, strengthening our cash flow, strengthening our FFO because about two thirds of it is O&M. And then we'll see where the other two land and then we are going to go from there. And when we have the Analyst Meeting, hopefully, early next year then we will tell you where we are at with that a little more definitively. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your questions. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Shaw. Shar Pourreza : Just one quick question on the delay of the ESP. Obviously, we just get a little bit of the sense on the status of the upcoming polar auctions and sort of, if there is a potential impact on your hedging profile and obviously you\u2019ve been lowering your weather sensitive hedges. But kind of curious on sort of how we should think about that? Chuck Jones : So let me answer the first piece of that with regard to the schedule. I do believe that the delay in the schedule was in part a desire and the part of the new administration under the new chair, Andre Porter, to get additional data points before having to make a decision. I think those -- even though the transitional options have been pushed back by the time we complete hearings of those data points will also be known. So, I don't anticipate further delays. Again, because if for no other reason, we need to secure additional polar auctions for flow to deliver, to be delivered by mid-next year, so I think we are at that point where, hopefully, we are actually going to go-forward at the end of August with hearing. And I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don with regard to the hedging part of the question. Don Schneider : As similarly with other market participants, we are going to have to adjust based on what that polar auction schedule is. Obviously, we try to build our planned ratably hedged through the year. If we need to, we will adjust to other channels, including our wholesale channels if we have to sell forward to lock in some of that that volume and eliminate price risk from a portfolio. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. That was it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning. Chuck Jones : Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, first question here. In terms of the timing, you obviously talked about at the Analyst Day early next year, but EEI this year in the back half the year in terms of the capital budgeting process and updating us on the outlook for the T&D wires, if you will side of the house holistically. Would you expect to give us an update on the CapEx and perhaps in tandem with that, I suppose balance sheet and cash flow considerations coming out of that? Chuck Jones : I think at EEI in November, we will give you what we\u2019ve typically given you at the EEI, which is our best look at the future across all of those. Yeah. And we are not going to hold anything back there. But I don't think we can talk about the long-term plan beyond the next couple years until we have the answers to those other two questions that I talked about. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And when you talk about long-term plan, let me just be a little bit clearer if you can or perhaps maybe the Analyst Day a little bit. Are we alluding to the future of the generation business here and how that fits within the context to your business or is the long-term plan more strictly defined within where the long-term trajectory of spend is in the context of your wires business? Chuck Jones : Julien, since I took over this job, January 1, I bet I've had the questions 500 times, what\u2019s the long-term growth strategy, what's the long-term vision and I think I've answered at the same way 500 times is, I will tell you that once we get a few of these short-term issues out of the way. So, I think it applies to all of that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Well, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Chin : Hi. Thanks and good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Brian. Brian Chin : When FERC made the decision about demand response in the transitional auctions, I was wondering to what extent, does that affect your thoughts with regards to the company's ability to not have to issue equity with regards to the competitiveness if at all. Chuck Jones : I don't think I've sat here ever thinking about issuing equity for the competitive business. And I think once the results of the cash flow improvement process, which substantial part was a result of the competitive business stepping up. Their particular credit metrics are going to look very strong. It\u2019s going to make a big impact on that part of the company. It makes an impact on the overall First Energy credit metrics too, but a substantial impact inside the competitive business. So, I think we are going to be fine there for the foreseeable future. We already had that business in a position where it was cash flow positive for the next four years. This makes it substantially more cash flow positive, which was the second factor in the decision to go forward with demand still dewatering. All the CapEx for that project was already in the four-year plan and already in a plan that was cash flow positive but we now got some margin there. And as I\u2019ve said along, the game plan with that business is to keep it cash flow positive and take that positive cash flow and eventually use it to start paying back the holding company for some of the loans that we made to that business a few years ago, so that\u2019s the long-term plan there. Brian Chin : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your questions. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Paul Patterson : First question, so you guys have been -- Chuck, you\u2019ve been making the grounds of the editorial boards. And there have been some interesting quotes and what have you. And I know that sometimes when you're being reported on -- meaning not coming out exactly as you intended it out. But just wondered if you could sort of elaborate a little bit more on your comments about re-regulation, trying to save the company, statements like that? And just how that fits in with this ESP proposal that you have -- the PPA proposal and just sort of comment a little bit more on that? Chuck Jones : Let\u2019s first talk a little bit about how our newspapers run. We went and met with the editorial board and we had what I thought was a good conversation over an hour and 50 minutes. But then it gets drilled down into an article. Once that articles written then there's a headline writer who goes and writes a headline to try to draw attention to that article. The headlines that was written for that article was completely inaccurate as to anything we discussed during that interview. In the interview, I was asked a specific question of, are we in anyway working to get the legislature of the state to consider re-regulating and my answer was no. In the context of the discussion about the PPAs, here's my view. We are talking about trying to find ways to preserve major generating assets that have plenty of useful life left in them and keep them from closing prematurely. Exelon is looking at doing that in Illinois and New York. Ohio utilities are looking at doing it in Ohio. You don't ever hear any conversation about needing to do that in states that are regulated. Regulated states have plenty of generation. They have integrated resource plans and if they need more generation, they either buy or build it, so they are assured they have adequate generation to serve their customers. So these PPAs, I see as a bridge to keep these plants alive, long enough to allow whatever happens. If our state wants to look at that issue over time, great, but its not going to happen fast enough for these two plants. If we are ultimately able to make significant corrections in the market to make sure they provide for the long-term security of baseload generating facility is great but I don\u2019t think we have time to wait on that either. And yesterday, the Senate Energy Committee put forth the bill that talks about asking the markets to try to come up with the process to make sure they ensure diversity of both, fuel and types of generating capacity across the markets. We don\u2019t have time to wait on that either. These plants are at risk today and we need to get a decision made as to whether we\u2019re going to look at ways to protect them, so we let all of those debates and legislation in Washington DC and everything else play out. Paul Patterson : Okay. I appreciate the clarity. Just thought I would hear straight from you. So then the second question I have for you is the fuel saving that you guys have been talking about, how sustainable is that? And do you see potential other opportunities? Or just in other words, it sounds that these steps are one-off? Do you follow what I\u2019m trying to say is, in other words I mean, how should we think about your ability to recognize fuel savings going forward? Chuck Jones : Well, I\u2019ll let Don ask -- answer it, but my view is they are sustainable. And I met with our fuel team yesterday about how we can get more. So under that context, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don. Don Moul : Yeah. Thanks, Chuck. And so, I touched on it briefly earlier, but we spent some time working with our key fuel suppliers and really looking for ways that can make us more competitive in the marketplace, while still keeping them viable in a tough marketplace for coal suppliers as well. Are there more opportunities, as Chuck mentioned? We\u2019re looking for those opportunities. But it\u2019s going to probably take some innovative approaches and working with our suppliers to get there, given the economics that we see right now. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. I appreciated. Thanks a lot. Chuck Jones : I mean, obvious context is that, the competitive generating fleets, both nuclear and fossil are under duress as a result of current market conditions. The second industry that\u2019s under equal or maybe the more duress is the coal industry. And I think, what we\u2019re trying to do is work together, partner together for the survival of both. Paul Patterson : Okay. But the nuclear fuel was in the free cash flow, seems to have come down your projection for that in 2015? Is that part of the savings or is that something else? Chuck Jones : There are some savings in there for nuclear fuel. And essentially, what we did there is we were looking at procuring additional nuclear fuel to take advantage of the very low prices of uranium that there are in the market today, way ahead of when we needed it. We don't need it for a number of years yet. We decided not to do that mainly on the basis that -- as we assess that uranium market, we think the pricing is going to stay where it\u2019s at for a long time and so, there was no urgency to try to need to capitalize on that this year. Paul Patterson : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from lines of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Most of the all my questions have been answered already. I\u2019m just wondering in the context of your guide, telling us that you\u2019re trending toward the high-end of the guidance range for \u201915, is that you\u2019re trending toward the high-end of the guidance range in all three segments\u2026 Chuck Jones : Yes. Greg Gordon : .. or you\u2019re doing better than expected in some in towards the midpoint of this? Chuck Jones : We are above the midpoint in all three segments through six months. And that combined with the CFIP results that we talked about that we\u2019re going to get in the second half of the year, are what cause us to say we can point you to the high-end of the guidance. So if you follow-on questions, well, why don't you just kind of change your guidance. The answer is we got $1.15 in the bank through six months. Our midpoint of our original guidance was $2.55, that means we got a $1.40 that we've got to capture the second half of the year just to get to the midpoint and the $1.55, we\u2019ve got to capture to get to the high-end of the range and we\u2019ve got a lot of very volatile weather months in the third quarter and a big third quarter. So, we just decided we\u2019re going to wait, see what happens in July and August in particular and then at the end of the third quarter, when we do this call at the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ll tell you where we expect to be more definitively at that time. Greg Gordon : Okay. So if whether normal or better for the rest of the year than you\u2019re comfortable that you\u2019re going to be at the high-end? Chuck Jones : Yes. Greg Gordon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. I have a capacity performance related question for you. Can you talk a little bit about given your largely coal and nuclear, what you physically done at the plants to prepare yourself to where you wouldn\u2019t -- you would be able to reduce the risk of having to pay penalties for failure to perform when called an emergency hours. What have you done different physically at the plant to prepare for this relative or compare to what you did in prior years? Chuck Jones : Well, I would say this, we did a number of things to prepare our plants for the winner of 2014, \u201815 and order to insure they operated reliably for this winner even in an environment were they weren\u2019t any penalties. As far as how we look at that going forward, we\u2019re going to make that determination in terms of how much you\u2019re willing to spend on reliability improvement versus where the capacity performance market clears. And in terms of the specific numbers, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to talk about those at this time. We need to see where both the base residual auction and then we\u2019re in particular the transaction auctions clear, because those are the more eminent. For the base residual, you got three years to figure how to get your units reliable for that one. The transition auctions are a little more pressing in terms of time. So we\u2019ll make those determinations once we see where the auction results come out. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciate it. Chuck Jones : Okay. Michael. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Paul Ridzon : Good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Paul Ridzon : Can you just talk about how you beat your guidance, kind of what the areas of strength were? And then I have a follow-up question after that. Chuck Jones : Jim. Jim Pearson : You are talking about our guidance for the third quarter, Paul? Paul Ridzon : Second quarter. Jim Pearson : Okay. For the second quarter, we looked at where we though we would be based on our plan. We did come about above the high end of our guidance. We defer some of our plant outages to later in the year. So we picked up a couple cents there. Distribution, they performed a little bit better, slightly lower O&M, and then we had slightly better results from our transmission business that we\u2019ve already talked about. So that\u2019s really what drove us above the top end of the guidance in the second quarter. Paul Ridzon : And are you still with your charges at the competitive business to reposition the portfolio? Jim Pearson : They will be substantially finished by the end of 2015 with only a minor amount carrying over the '16. Paul Ridzon : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions. Anthony Crowdell : Hey. Good morning, Chuck. Just I guess a PPA type question. Since the last call, you\u2019ve had the governor of Ohio announced his intention of obtaining the Republican nomination. Does that complicate the PPA process because sometimes you have campaigns that are more interested in what\u2019s better for a national audience and maybe not focused on what would be beneficial to like Ohio customers or Ohio rate bears in this case? Chuck Jones : My view would be I think it's a non-factor. I think the governor's decision to run for a President is a political decision and it affects things that might happen politically. I think he's made it clear all along that he expects that you\u2019ll have Public Utilities Commission to look at this issue and make an informed decision on this issue. So I don't think that would change as a result of this decision. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck Jones : Okay. I don\u2019t see any more questions in the queue. So we\u2019re going to actually end few minutes earlier here. I want to thank everybody for your support and obviously we feel good about where we are at for -- Philson just popped in there. So I\u2019m going to stop and let Philson ask his question. Operator : Thank you. Philson Yim with Luminus, please go ahead with your question. Philson Yim : Just talk about that the $1.55 to capture high end for the rest of the year? On LTM, transmission is basically R&D at a midpoint is basically what I see. Is that right? Chuck Jones : Yeah. That\u2019s correct, Philson. Philson Yim : And do you expect transmission to only grow kind of $0.04 for the balance of the year to get to the high end or are there offsets there? Jim Pearson : No. I won\u2019t say there is any offset. I talked a little bit earlier. I don't think you'll see the growth in the revenues that you did see in the first half. You saw $0.20 there in the first half. We\u2019ve guided to the $0.30 for the year. I think we\u2019re going to be slightly above that. Some of the offsets that you saw during the first half were depreciation general taxes and interest. They will probably be about in line the second half of the year as they were at the first half of the year. So I think we will trend as Chuck said to the upper end of the range on transmission, but it's not going to be same $0.11 that you saw in the first half. Philson Yim : Okay. Thank you. And distribution, to the midpoint there is a $0.10 drop year-over-year expected? But year-to-date, you guys are tracking at, are there offsets expected in the second half of the year? Jim Pearson : Yeah. Right now, Philson, we are tracking about $0.01 behind where we\u2019re last year, and we guided you to about $0.11 behind. There is a few offsets. We had some improvement in distribution. We\u2019ve been helped somewhat by weather and the earlier part of the year. So I would not expect based on normal weather going throughout the rest of the year that we would drop down to the $0.11 that we guided you to. Philson Yim : Got it. Thank you. Jim Pearson : That will be at upper end also. Philson Yim : Thank you very much. Sorry to everyone for extending the call. Chuck Jones : We had a bet when I was going out and you cost me a lunch. Now, thanks to everybody as I said. I think we are off to a great start this year. We feel good about the results. I will tell you, I am constantly impressed with our team here and whatever we asked them to deliver they find a way. Under Donny's leadership, this cash flow improvement team exceeded my expectations. I don't know what your expectations were when I told you we were going to get to $200 million but they exceeded my expectations. And we are working hard to and we\u2019ll capture those savings over the next couple years. So thanks for your support and we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter call and probably many of you in between. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website. Participating in today\u2019s call are Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Meghan. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to report another solid quarter for FirstEnergy. Last night we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share, which is $0.06 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. As Jim will discuss in greater detail, these results reflect a solid performance across all three of our business segments. Based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we\u2019re raising and narrowing our full year 2015 operating earnings guidance to a range of 267 to 275 per share from our previous range of 240 to 270 per share. This is shaping up to be a great year for FirstEnergy and as we look forward to 2016, our employees can be proud of what they\u2019ve achieved. In addition to strong earnings, we have made tremendous progress on key initiatives that can provide us with greater strength and flexibility as we work to achieve our future goals. So far this year we have clarity on the results from two of these initiatives. The cash flow improvement project and PJM capacity market reforms and we continue to make progress on the third initiative, the Ohio ESP. As we discussed in July, our cash flow improvement project exceeded our initial target and should generate at least 240 million in cash flow improvements by 2017. That project would solicit cost savings ideas from across the company is rolling out as we expected and we remain fully on track to capture the 58 million in cash flow improvements identified for 2015. Overall, this effort is not only establishing a new cost structure for the company. It has also helped us to initiate a culture change around spending. Employees continue to provide suggestions for meaningful and sustainable ways to reduce our cost structure, which could drive modes incremental savings going forward on top of what we have already communicated. We\u2019re also cautiously optimistic capacity market reforms that are now in place at PJM. Results from the base residual and transitional auctions held in August and September were in line with our expectations. With the pay for performance model resulting and clearing prices that come closer to reflecting the true operating costs of our generating plans. You\u2019ll recall that we raised our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for our competitive business in September as a result of the higher capacity and all of our uncommitted generation clearing the transitional auction for the 2016, 2017 delivery years. And we are reaffirming that range. We\u2019re also raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance based on our year-to-date results and the impact of our cash flow initiative. While Jim will provide more of the details about adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business in a few minutes, I wanted to take a moment to address our current thinking about 2017. All of our uncommitted generation cleared the 2017, 2018 transitional auction as well. But as you know our proposed purchase power agreement Ohio would impact generation sales for seven months in 2016 and the full year of 2017. So while we consider providing an adjusted EBITDA range for 2017 on this call, we ultimately decided that we do not have enough information yet to offer a constructive view. We remain committed to being transparent and we intend to provide you with this outlook once there is more clarity. With that said, we\u2019re pleased that the combination of our cash flow initiative and PJM capacity revenues from recent auctions will further strengthen the overall cash flow position for our competitive business. And you\u2019ll recall that we already expected that business to be cash flow positive through at least 2018, prior to the incremental benefits of these two initiatives. Many of you have asked if we intend to shut down additional shut down additional plants. I tell our employees, we\u2019re working hard to ensure all remaining generation remains viable. The results of the Ohio ESP and future auctions will give us a better understanding of the longer term outlook on our at risk space [ph] little power plants and we continue to consider fuel and transportation contracts as well as environmental matters such as the EPAs Clean Power Plan, which was finalized in August. We are particularly interested and that rolls treatment of existing nuclear generation, state specific emission reduction targets, the compliance time line and state flexibility. While we are advocating for an interpretation that allows for a thoughtful engineering based approach to ensure reliable energy resources for our customers, we will not have full clarity on the rules impact until state implementation plans are submitted, which could be as late as 2018 and then approved by the EPA. To ensure that our critical base little power plants continue operating and to help safeguard our customers against price increases and volatility, we remain committed to our Ohio Electric Security Plan. The evidence you\u2019re already hearing for the ESP began August and rebuttal testimony was filed last week. We currently expect a decision by early 2016 and we continue our discussions with the PUCO staff and other parties to reach a positive outcome for our Ohio customers. In fact you may have noticed that Leila is not on the call today. She is in Columbus, working on the ESP as we speak and I think that\u2019s where we would all rather have her. Once we have an outcome in Ohio, we have the information necessary to more fully assess FirstEnergy\u2019s earning for 2016, regulated growth in future years as well as our cash flow over the next several years. As we\u2019ve talked about previously, at that point we will determine future equity needs, if any to help support our regulated growth initiatives. We\u2019re also laying the ground work for sustainable reliability investments in Pennsylvania. Last week, our four utilities in the state filed long-term infrastructure improvement plans with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In total these plans call for a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over the next five years to strengthen, upgrade and modernize our distribution systems. We\u2019re anticipating that PUCs approval of the LTA [ph] proposals by mid-February. Once we have approval to the plan, we will use the distribution system improvement charge at each company to recover the appropriate fixed costs that are the part of the plans. In New Jersey, we\u2019re further enhancing our current service reliability program with an additional 25 million spending in 2015. These expenditures which are expected to have a $0.04 per share impact on fourth quarter of 2015 earnings, will not only enhance our current service reliability program, but also demonstrate our commitment to make JCP&L a stronger company. Of course a significant part of our growth plan includes our growth plan includes our Energizing the Future transmission initiative which remains on pace to invest $970 million this year with about 80% of that amount spent year-to-date. Recent projects include final planning and preliminary site work for a new substation near Smithfield West Virginia that will support the shale gas industry and enhance service reliability in Mon Power. We are also nearing completion on a transmission reinforcement project including a substation and 6 mile, 138 kV line in Harrison County West Virginia that will enhance service reliability for more than 14,000 Mon Power customers in Harrison, Louis and Gilmer counties. We expect the substation to be energized in December. We are pleased to report that late yesterday afternoon FERC approved our settlement agreement for ATSI\u2019s forward-looking formula rate structure. In addition, our proposal to move our Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L transmission assets into a new affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT is moving through the FERC and state approval processes. We continue to seek final state approval for MAIT by mid-2016. If approved we expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. Lastly we remain committed to holding an analyst meeting after we have results from our Ohio case. Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. As always we will reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour. Jim Pearson : Thanks Chuck and good morning everyone. Before I get started I will remind you that more detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions in the Q&A or following the call. Our strong third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share compares to $0.89 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis earnings were $0.94 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.79 per share during the same period last year. Our operating earnings primarily reflect higher distribution sales and the net impact of previously resolved rate cases. Higher transmission revenues that resulted from our Energizing the Future initiative and ATSI\u2019s forward-looking rate structure and higher commodity margin in our competitive business partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate. In our distribution business residential sales increased 9% and commercial sales increased 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from cooling degree days that were 36% higher than last year and 13% above normal. Adjusting for weather however, residential deliveries decreased nearly 1% and commercials sales were down 2.4% reflecting the impact of energy efficiency mandates. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we are examining the usage trend in all three customer classes particularly the impact of energy efficiency on residential usage and we will be prepared to discuss our load forecast in more detail during our analyst meeting. However, we do believe we are seeing the effects of energy efficient lightings sooner and with a larger impact than previous estimates. In the industrial sector, sales decreased 3.2% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, coal mining and electrical equipment and manufacturing customers partially offset by increased usage from shale gas and automotive sectors. In our transmission business third quarter operating earnings increased $0.04 to $0.17 per share as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI\u2019s forward-looking rate structure which began in January. In our competitive business operating earnings increased $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014. Commodity margin increased $0.15 per share due to favorable summer weather that was warm, but not extreme coupled with lower commodity costs. Contract sales volume decreased in line with our expectation, while wholesale sales volume increased slightly. Variable margin benefited from higher capacity revenues, lower purchase power costs and fuel expense and lower transmission charges. Operating cost increased compared to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to greater expense related to a nuclear refueling outage this quarter at Beaver Valley 2. We remain committed to our ongoing strategy of mitigating risk by reducing sales to weather sensitive channels and have reduced the size of our residential retail book by approximately 38% since the third quarter of 2014 and also reduced the size of our weather sensitive commercial industrial book over the same period. Looking at our sales position, for 2016 we have about 59 million megawatt hours or about 75% of our expected generation resources committed and we are currently about 45% committed for 2017 with about 36 million megawatt hours sold. As Chuck discussed earlier, we are raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business to 945 million to 975 million from 875 million to 950 million based on our results through the first nine months of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement project. We are also reaffirming the 2016 adjusted EBITDA range that we provided in September of 950 million to 1.5 billion and as Chuck mentioned we intend to provide 2017 adjusted EBITDA after the Ohio ESP is resolved. Moving to other financial matters, during the September investor conferences, we received questions about our pension funding plan. So we wanted to spend a moment clarifying this topic. As we do each year, we disclosed our estimated pension funding requirements for the next several years as of December 31, 2014 in the Form 10-K that was filed in February and as always we include those future funding estimates in our internal long-term planning process. You\u2019ll recall we contributed $143 million to our pension fund earlier this year. Consistent with our normal process we will provide an update for estimated funding requirement for future years when we file our 2015 Form 10-K this coming February. I will also note that we have essentially completed our financing plans for 2015 and our expected financing plans for 2016 do not include any issuance of long term debt until the middle of next year. As Chuck said earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a strong and important year for FirstEnergy as we create a new frame work for our future. We have raised our operating earnings guidance based on the success of our strategies and we are making solid progress towards our goals of building long-term value for shareholders through predictable customer focused regulated growth. Now I would like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Just a quick question I guess on Ohio PPA I am sure it will be a trend for the call, but I believe the record closes today in Columbus does the closing of the record complicate the chances of a settlement since nothing new could be introduced. Chuck Jones : I don\u2019t think it complicates the opportunity for a settlement at all. I think we have the opportunity to settle the case all the way through any final outcome actually. So it closes the record as far as anything new being introduced into the record as far as testimony and rebuttal testimony, but it doesn\u2019t prohibit ongoing discussions. Anthony Crowdell : Great, thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question is from Greg Orrill with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question. Greg Orrill : Yeah, thank you. May be a follow up there on generally how you are feeling about the process of negotiating the PPAs and whether you feel you have better likelihood of nuclear versus coal. Chuck Jones : Well as I\u2019ve said all along, I think that the plan that we filed is the best plan for the customers in Ohio and we continue to work to educate the commission staff as best we can on why we believe that is the case. I think, we are continuing to discuss certain parameters around the filing, but I would expect that as we go forward we are going to continue to talk about the PPA in somewhat the fashion that we filed it. Now, having said that there is always some room for negotiation, but I think the whole idea here is, we filed a plan that\u2019s good for customers, protects them over the long haul and at the end of the day as I\u2019ve told - I\u2019ve gone through the example of what happens when plants closed in the past, it creates spending and transmission that customers pay for so I think this plan kind of is neutral to what the transmission spending would be and I still think that something that we can get through across goal line with. Greg Orrill : And maybe just a question around the pension mark-to- market and kind of your treatment there and that doesn\u2019t show up in the earnings guidance, how are you thinking about that? Jim Pearson : Yeah, Greg this is Jim. It will not show up in our operating earnings guidance. We have historically treated that as a mark-to-market, in fact if you look at our consolidated report we have put a disclosure in there of what the range of potential impact or GAAP earnings would be if we would have marked that pension plan. Effective September 30, our plan had a loss on our return on assets of about 3.5% and discount range was 4.25%, so we put a range in there assuming that our assets return will remain at that level and the discount rate would be anywhere between 4.25% and 4.5%. As you know October has been a very good month in the equity markets, in fact it\u2019s been probably one of the strongest months in history, so the return on our assets has improved somewhat and if we had to mark that today our discount range would be in the 4.5% range. So my expectation, all things being equal, if they don\u2019t change from today that range that we gave of $0.30 to $0.67, it would be the lower end and in fact it may be less than $0.37 and may be less than 250 million that we disclosed. From a funding stand point, we have disclosed in the 10-K last year that it would be above 1.7 billion for the period \u201815 through \u201819. We did contribute a 143 million this year. From a funding standpoint we will have to see where the discount rate is and where the return on the assets are at the end of the year, but I don\u2019t expect anything to be materially different than what we disclosed in our 10-K in 2014. Greg Orrill : Great, thanks Chuck Jones : I would just follow on a little bit though Jim\u2019s answered it. I think we have been very open in disclosing what our pension funding obligations might be and the impact on our GAAP earnings, but from the very beginning of me coming into this position, one of the things we talked about was earnings quality and I think this quarter $0.94 and $0.98 GAAP versus non-GAAP. We have really reduced that gap between GAAP and non-GAAP as I told you I would and I think our earnings quality for all three quarters is substantially improved and that\u2019s the way we expect to operate going forward. Greg Orrill : Thank you, congratulations on the quarter Chuck Jones : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Zimbardo with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Paul Zimbardo : Good morning, another Ohio question if you will. We have seen few data points on potential new bill in Ohio recently now just hoping you could comment on how if at all you see these developments impacting the discussion the Ohio mission that\u2019s starting, yeah. Chuck Jones : I wouldn\u2019t expect that they should have any impact on the discussion we are having with Ohio and there\u2019s - conversely I don\u2019t think the discussions we are having with Ohio should have any impact on any decisions for new builds because the construct of our energy security plan it has no impact on the competitive markets, so I don\u2019t think the two are linked at all. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, great and then unrelated question, I noticed the revolver borrowing fund about a billion quarter-over-quarter ,could you comment on if this represents kind of change in how you see the financial structure? Jim Pearson : Yeah, I am not sure that revolver borrowings increased a billion dollars quarter-over-quarter, in fact if you look at our entire financing plan for the entire year we expect to increase debt just by above $350 million dollars year-over-year and most of that will be new long-term debt associated with the distribution and transmission business. In fact our revolver borrowings at the end of the 2014 were about 1.8 billion and my expectation is that they are going to be right in that range maybe slightly less than that the by the end of the year. So there is no real impact on our financing plans there. Paul Zimbardo : Okay I just looked at the short-term borrowing declined a billion, I know you\u2019d mentioned in the past your trying to or considering terming - Jim Pearson : I thought you said that they were up and that was what was confusing me, right. Now they would be down. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Sorry to clarify, is that indication that you are trying to term more out or that\u2019s just kind of normal fluctuation for the quarter. A That\u2019s normal fluctuation. It\u2019s not that we are terming any of that out. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Turnure with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Chris Turnure : Good morning guys, I wanted to get a little bit more clarity on transmission CapEx going forward basically versus the current CapEx that you have laid out in your slides. If you are successful with the, I guess the innovation [ph] of the assets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania how can we think about directional potential changes there in magnitude? Chuck Jones : Well you\u2019re going to have to wait for the analyst meeting. We\u2019ve talked about 4.2 billion of transmission spend, four year period from \u201814 through \u201817 and at this point in time I am not prepared to say where we expect that number to be \u201818 and beyond, but I think as we get through the Ohio ESP and then we see the company that we have a base to build upon after that. I think when we have our Analyst Meeting we\u2019ll talk to you more about what we expect to do in the future. Chris Turnure : Okay. And then on cost cutting, you indicated that there is a potential to increase the numbers as you\u2019ve laid them out right now, the numbers are pretty meaningful over the next several years, but they do mostly come from the unregulated side of the business. Could you talk a little bit more in detail maybe about what you\u2019re looking at that\u2019s incremental to this and any opportunities more specifically on the regulated side of the business there? Chuck Jones : Well, first off, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be substantial and what I\u2019ve kind of challenged the team to do is we need to continue to find efficiencies in this business that will offset any inflationary forces on our cost structure, specific to the utility side of things in an environment where we\u2019re investing in reliability improvements now pretty much across our footprint. Taking cost out of the utilities doesn\u2019t make sense right now. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of it come out of the utilities. We\u2019re taking any incremental. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not focusing on efficient spending in the utilities, but as we create the efficiencies where recycling that back into more investment and more improved service for our customers rather than pulling it out and ultimately reducing the cost structure for the utilities. Chris Turnure : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mr. Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Dan Eggers : Hi, good morning, guys. First question for you just on the transmission guidance increase, CapEx has been in line basically with plan, but the earnings power from transmissions were 10% higher than you had budgeted for the year. What are you ascribing that improvement to? And how should we think about capitalizing the new base line for \u201816 and beyond? Jim Pearson : Yeah, this is Jim. The way I would look at that, Dan, is that when we went into the year, we had some relatively conservative assumptions because of the uncertainty with the forward-looking rates within ATSI, not only the ROE but potential refunding in that. So I would say our initial estimate was somewhat conservative. And we also have a little higher rate base associated with in servicing some of the projects sooner than we had anticipated. When I would compare, say, \u201816 to \u201815, clearly we\u2019ll give you more guidance at our Analyst Meeting. But I would say the headwinds we are going to face next year is, we are going to have a lower ROE in ATSI. So that\u2019s going to impact our earnings somewhat and some of our transmission spend will be directed towards the former GPU companies where they\u2019re still on standard rates and I would not look for me like rate recovery until beginning in 2017. So I would consider probably \u201815 and \u201816 years to be somewhat flattish and then we will move on in \u201817 once we have the MAIT completed in investments going towards the GPU companies. Dan Eggers : That was helpful. Thank you. On the demand response case, the Supreme Court\u2019s heard it now, you guys are very vested in the process. What was your read on what happened in this Supreme Court and then your expectations for when we\u2019ll get a decision and then whatever adoptions that the PJM will have to make. Chuck Jones : So I should have preempted all of these Q&A by stating this. I said earlier, Leila is not here and I don\u2019t think you want any of us other than Leila judging what\u2019s happening at the Supreme Court. So here is what I\u2019ll do, Dan, Irene will talk with Leila and we\u2019ll get back to you on that one, but I just don\u2019t feel comfortable asking - answering technical legal questions. Dan Eggers : Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And then, Jim, looking back at the 10-K on the pension, I know this is kind of still bubbling out there. You guys had said out about $880 million for pension funding in \u201816 and \u201817 and then 646 in \u201818, \u201819, are those still realistic or is there a weighted shift some of the timing of that money being put to work? Jim Pearson : No, those are still pretty much realistic and those are based on requirements. Dan, it\u2019s not that we can shift money. We could fund more earlier, but you look at what your funding has to be over a seven-year period and so you have to fund at least that amount. I don\u2019t expect when we update that \u201816 and \u201817 will be much different than what we disclosed in our 10-K for 2014. But we will just update some of the years based on where the return on the assets are and where the discount rate is. The Senate had just passed the, I guess, I got the five partisan budget bill. We had extended the funding or the smoothing requirements three additional years through 2020, so that will give some type of relief, because you will be able to use your historical discount rate during those funding periods. So that will lessen all things being equal our funding requirements over that period of time. Dan Eggers : So your assumptions in the 10-K are reflective of the extension of the smoothing or would that lower that number? Jim Pearson : No, the 10-K that we filed in 2014 did not take into account any of the changes to the smoothing and primarily that smoothing doesn\u2019t impact our funding until year 2019. Dan Eggers : Okay and then I guess just on the financing side of it, you guys have been keen not to talk about equity needs and that sort of thing, but should we expect more comprehensive planning update at the Analyst and would that then include whatever you would have to fund for the pension perspective? Chuck Jones : Yeah, I think that\u2019s the whole game plan, Dan. Let\u2019s get Ohio behind us one way or another, find out where that leaves us. We know pretty much where capacity performance landed and we know we\u2019ve done internally to strengthen our cash flows. I think at that point in time we are going to give you more of a view towards the future. Two thousand and fifteen has been all about kind of strengthening the base that we want to build from. Dan Eggers : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Can you hear me? Chuck Jones : Good morning. Yeah. Paul Patterson : Okay. Just as a follow-up on Ohio for a second, if you guys were to get a settlement, what would the process be in terms of after that? I mean would there be - I assume comments there would be and stuff on that and how much time before after a settlement, do you think it would take for approval of that settlement to take place? Chuck Jones : Yes, there would be an opportunity for comment. I expect we are going to end up at the same place here regardless of a settlement which is an outcome that\u2019s finalized early next year. Paul Patterson : Okay and by early you mean first couple of months. Chuck Jones : I would think so, yeah. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then in terms of the pension funding, could you remind me how much the breakdown is between regulated and non-regulated with that obligation? Chuck Jones : I would say that probably about 60% of the unfunded would reside in the regulated companies. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then you mentioned some intriguing step about the energy efficiency in lighting and the deployment of that\u2019s been a little bit more aggressive than what you previously have thought. I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what sectors you are seeing that in and what customer classes? Chuck Jones : From my standpoint, the biggest impact has been in the residential sector. We\u2019ve seen somewhat in commercial, typically commercial customers will move towards more energy efficient products sooner than residential. But when you think about the lighting, the Federal Energy Efficiency Lighting standards kicked in 2015. You can\u2019t buy an incandescent bulb right now and we\u2019ve always expected that we would see some impact to our residential usage associated with that. It\u2019s just happening a little bit faster than we had originally planned on our original load forecast. Paul Patterson : How much - I guess why is that do you think? And because like you said, all the stuff is sort of known. I mean what do you - can you give us a little bit more flavors to how much more that you are seeing and why you think you are seeing it? Chuck Jones : It\u2019s hard for me to talk about customer behavior especially this early on, but my suspicion is that the cost of these bulbs are coming down and they are being offered in a number of stores and consumers are just switching those bulbs sooner than we thought they would be. And as we said, we are looking at this pretty closely right now and we should have a better view on that when we come to the Analyst Meeting. But as we said, we automatically knew that this was going to happen. It\u2019s just maybe happening a little sooner than we expected. Paul Patterson : Okay. And we\u2019ll find out obviously in the Analyst Meeting what it means for energy - for the energy efficiency, but I would suggest that you guys are expecting to see more sooner than previously thought. Is that --? Chuck Jones : Yeah, we\u2019ll have that build into the load forecast we have. Paul Patterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Ridzon : Thank you. I just had a real quick question about CES fourth quarter drivers. I think I\u2019ve done math right, recalling looking for a flattish quarter versus 4Q last year after you had a nice pickup in the third quarter here? Chuck Jones : Yeah, I would say during the fourth quarter we would expect that the earnings would be pretty much flat quarter-over-quarter. Paul Ridzon : We\u2019re getting a big capacity pick-up, aren\u2019t we? Chuck Jones : Yeah, we are, but we have Beaver Valley that\u2019s out essentially in an entire month of October. Paul Ridzon : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman : Thank you. I just have one left. On the LTIP that was filed in Pennsylvania a couple of weeks ago, it implies from the release that\u2019s a quarterly rate rider. Is that a done deal? I mean is that legislation or is that - you took commission [indiscernible] another utility that\u2019s done that? You are pretty confident you will get that quarterly rider? Chuck Jones : Well, the way the process works in Pennsylvania as you file a long-term infrastructure improvement plan, which pretty much details the types of investments and the impact for customers that you expect to achieve. The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission reviews the LTIP, Once they review and approve the plan, then recovery under the distribution system, plus recovery rider is essentially, it\u2019s a legislative recovery and it\u2019s essentially very certain [ph] after that. So as long as we spend what we say we were going to spend and do what we say we\u2019re going to do. Charles Fishman : Okay. That was the only question I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question. Ashar Khan : Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Chuck, just going back to the expectations of getting this case done by early next year, is it fair to assume that - are you able to reach a settlement it should come in the next month or so? Chuck Jones : I\u2019m not going to handicap it, Ashar. I mean we\u2019re working every day, talking on the phone, Leila is down there meeting with the staff today, working through a lot of complex issues and it\u2019s a very complex case. So I don\u2019t want to put pressure on Leila nor on the Commission staff or any other parties that we are talking with. We just keep working through the process. And I believe that there is an opportunity for an ultimate settlement, because I think that we are getting to the point where everybody is starting to really understand why it\u2019s good for customers. Ashar Khan : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick questions, one on CS, when we look at 2017 fact book and we look at the breakdown of the hedges and the contracted revenues that you have, it looks like there is a significant proportion that\u2019s clearly open right now, 36 terawatt hours that\u2019s committed sales and the rest is open. Do you expect more committed sales to happen in the buckets of the MM, MCI, OCI, GA [indiscernible] those structures? Do you expect more contracting or committed sales to happen in 2017 for that? Or is it generally all going to flow into the wholesale bucket? Chuck Jones : The first item is it does not contemplate PPA scenario at all. So we are successful in getting the PPAs done. That will reduce by about half. Donny Schneider : Yeah. Chuck Jones : Donny, go ahead. Donny Schneider : Yeah, yeah, Chuck is absolutely right. With the PPA, we only have about 3 terawatt hours open in the front half of \u201817 and about 16 terawatt hours in the back half and to answer your question, with the PPA we would move that into our sales channels regardless of the PPA, we would move it into the sales channels, we wouldn\u2019t take it all to the wholesale market. Without the PPA, you\u2019ve got a 41 terawatt hours again more heavily weighted on the back half of \u201817. Unidentified Analyst : Got you and that 41 terawatt hours, if there is no PPA would be moving into the wholesale bucket? Donny Schneider : No, no. We would move it into our LCI or [indiscernible] channels. Wholesale is kind of our last resort if you will, because we don\u2019t make much margin on that. Unidentified Analyst : So of the 80 or so terawatt hours in total approximately 40 would be committed in the non-PPA scenario? Donny Schneider : No, we would still hold some back for the spot market. We would hold back by about 15 to 20 terawatt hours in the spot market. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. So what is the total committed sales you would expect in the non-PPA scenario for 2017? Donny Schneider : So it would be about 75 minus 15 or 20 so about 55 terawatt hours. Unidentified Analyst : I got you. Okay, got it. Chuck Jones : What Donny is describing is we are going to run that business kind of like a utility. We are going to sell forward two-thirds to three-fourths of our available generation. We are going to keep, as he said, 15 to 20 megawatt hours opened to use as what I refer to as reserve margin to ensure ourselves against weather days, cold weather days to ensure ourselves against a unit. It doesn\u2019t perform as expected and essentially be able to deliver more consistent earnings out of that sector than what we have been able to do in the past because we were exposed to volatility and we were exposed to poor performance by our generating fleet. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. Sorry, go ahead. Donny Schneider : As you said, if you look at our fact book on slide 98, page 49, it lays out those sales channels and our ranges around it. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, now got it exactly. I\u2019m just saying that I looked at the fact book for 2017 that 36 terawatt hours of committed sales and I was just trying to bridge to what would it look like in naturally 2017 if you had no PPA and that was helpful color that you gave me. Donny Schneider : Sure. Unidentified Analyst : If I would have bridged to that number that you just said, as you exit certain [indiscernible] contracts, how did that shape like the 2017 committed sales? I\u2019m just trying to understand what would be the proportions of the different buckets as you kind of think about in a non-PPA scenario, what it would look like with the committed sales? Donny Schneider : Yeah, so I would say in a non-PPA scenario if you look at our 2016 EBITDA slide, that\u2019s going to give you the pretty good proportions and we are not intending to change those proportions. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. Got you. Okay, thank you and then finally just a quick question on NOLs. I know that NOLs clearly help from a deferred tax perspective right now. Do you still kind of see them as a 2017-18 timeframe kind of full utilization of NOLs? Chuck Jones : Yeah, our expectation is that, well, first bonus depreciation, we think it\u2019s likely to be extended through the \u201815 and \u201816 timeframe. That\u2019s not part of the budget bill, but it\u2019s typically done usually at the end of the year in an extender. If the bonus depreciation is not extended, then we\u2019ll likely expire our NOLs around the end of 2018 or into 2019. Assuming bonus depreciation is extended, then we could go out further into the 2020 timeframe. Again that would be impacted by the resolution of the Ohio ESP. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Ryan Caylor with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Caylor : Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Morning. Ryan Caylor : Just back to the Ohio PPA real quick, just a quick question on timing AP [ph] on their Q3 2015 earnings call they gave I guess a year end 2015 expectations for a final order for their PPA. I guess it\u2019s our understanding that you guys are further long in the process right? So I mean is that difference in timing a matter of AP just being you know I guess a little more aggressive relative to your kind of early Q1 2016 timeline or any color there relative to AP would be helpful? Thanks. Chuck Jones : Well, I would say that I think we are all just kind of trying to speculate about what could happen. We are being a little more conservative maybe then the AP in there traditionally there is not going to get a lot done in December after Thanks Giving for our RKs to get settled by the end of this calendar year they have to work pretty hard pretty much the whole month of December I think to meet the time tables so we are just expecting likely to get done after the first three year. Ryan Caylor : Got it. That\u2019s helpful thanks. Chuck Jones : Okay, well I don\u2019t see any more questions on our call so I want to thank you all very much for your support and just say look forward to you in a week from Monday at EEI and I am sure we will go through all these questions again. Thank you. Jim Pearson : Thanks everybody. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you're able to join us. I'm excited to share the results from an important and productive year for FirstEnergy. In 2015 we made tremendous progress on major initiatives across our company. We put a number of obstacles behind us and completed critical work necessary to implement our regulated growth strategy going forward. At the same time, we consistently met our financial commitments to you. Last night we reported operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.71 per share for the year. These results, which reflect improved operations at our Competitive business, as well as growth in our Transmission business are above our initial guidance range for 2015, and in line with the revised estimates that we provided during our third quarter call despite the mild weather we experienced in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2016, we have provided operating earnings guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. As we will discuss later, we intend to provide additional guidance once we have an outcome in our Ohio Electric Security Plan. Before we move to Jim's financial review, I'll take a few minutes to discuss the key events from 2015. First, we removed regulatory uncertainty and important steps to position our regulated utilities for growth with the conclusion of rate cases in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Resolving these cases allows us to plan for additional infrastructure and reliability investments at those utilities. In Pennsylvania, we took that next step by filing Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plans for each of our four operating companies in October. These plans, which were approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission last week, outline a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over five years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. Yesterday, we filed for approval to implement a distribution system improvement charge at each of the four operating companies, which will allow us to recover quarterly costs associated with the capital projects approved in the LTIIPs. In Ohio, we achieved an important milestone for our latest Electric Security Plan by reaching a settlement agreement with the staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and 16 other parties, including EnerNOC, an energy management solutions provider, Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, a low income customer advocacy group, and IGS Energy, an independent energy supplier. The agreement outlines the ambitious steps to safeguard Ohio customers against retail price increases and volatility in future years, deploy new energy efficiency programs, and provide a clear path to a cleaner energy future by reducing carbon emissions. Our settlement includes an eight-year retail rate stability rider associated with the proposed Purchased Power Agreement. This provision will help protect customers against rising retail prices and market volatility while helping preserve vital base load power plants that serve Ohio customers and provide thousands of jobs in the state. The PPA includes the Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in Oak Harbor, Ohio, which recently received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license extension, and a portion of the output of two OVEC plants. The procedural schedule for our Ohio case is nearly complete, with hearings concluded, initial briefs filed, and reply briefs due next Friday. A decision from the PUCO is expected in March. Clearly, there is a lot of talk about the PPA as all interested parties seek to have their voices heard. We firmly believe that our plan serves the best interests of Ohio customers and Ohio communities while supporting competitive markets in the state and PJM. This generation will continue to be offered into PJM's energy and capacity markets, and the PPA will have no impact on our standard service offer or customers' ability to shop for their retail electric supply. In fact, we expect that the output from these plants will be treated no differently than the 20% of regulated generation that currently clears in the PJM markets, and that 20% does not include imports into PJM, which from MISO would be primarily regulated generation. I'm sure you'll have lots of questions about the legal and regulatory process, and Leila's standing by to share our perspective during the Q&A. We believe our plan is the right one for Ohio, and we remain very optimistic in the outcome, both in Ohio and at FERC. Let's turn to our Transmission business. We just passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future, transmission investment initiative to meet the reliability needs of our customers and communities. We remain on track to meet our target of $4.2 billion in spending during the 2014 through 2017 timeframe. Consistent with our plan, we spent $2.4 billion in 2014 and 2015, including $986 million last year, on projects to address service reliability, grid modernization and growth. We completed major initiatives to address last year's Northeast Ohio plant deactivations, and brought online critical new infrastructure to support midstream gas operations in our region. Work in 2016 is expected to include $1 billion in investments on projects such as synchronous condensers at our Eastlake Plant, new line construction projects in West Virginia and New Jersey, Static Var Compensator projects in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia, and several new substations, line rebuilds and reconductoring projects. While expansion in the shale markets has cooled, we expect investments over the next several years of about $150 million for work that is already in the pipeline. We also addressed several matters in 2015 that support future investment in this important long-term growth platform. During the fourth quarter, FERC approved our settlement for a forward-looking formula rate structure at our ATSI subsidiary which permits more timely recovery of our investments. In addition, in June we filed to create a new subsidiary named Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission, or MAIT. This subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for those customers. Our proposal is on FERC's agenda for tomorrow and we are seeking approval from both the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities by the middle of the year. These structural changes are important steps to ensure timely recovery of our investments and set the stage for continued growth through our Energizing the Future transmission initiative. Turning to our Competitive operations, the PJM capacity market reforms approved by FERC have already begun to have a positive impact on the capacity auction process, although the markets continue to fall well short of being compensatory for long-lived capital assets like base load generation units. Our revised competitive strategy, focusing on stabilizing the business by reducing risk, also produced positive results. In 2015, we sold 75 million megawatt-hours while significantly reducing our exposure to weather-sensitive load and executing a rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. As a result, we mitigated the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2015 and achieved adjusted EBITDA of $949 million. This is in line with the revised guidance that we provided in October and reflects solid operational results as well as the impact of our Cash Flow Improvement Project. We are holding off on providing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 and 2018 until our Analyst Meeting following the PUCO decision in Ohio. However, we are reaffirming both our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the Competitive business of $950 million to $1.05 billion, and our expectation that the business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018. Before I move from our Competitive segment, I'll mention that given the significant decline in the global coal market, we impaired our investment in the Signal Peak mine, resulting in a $362 million pre-tax noncash charge, which Jim will cover in more detail. Finally, I'll spend a few moments discussing our Cash Flow Improvement Plan and other financial matters. We took a very important step to improve our financial metrics and balance sheet in 2015 through the launch of the Cash Flow Improvement Project. This initiative began in the spring, with a goal to capture meaningful and sustainable savings opportunities and process improvements across the company while continuing to fully meet the needs of our customers, our organization and our employees. I'm very pleased with the results of this effort to-date. We are on track to capture $155 million in savings this year and $240 million annually by 2017, up from our initial goal of $200 million over the timeframe. The results from this initiative will allow us to essentially hold our O&M flat through 2017. We put a lot of risk behind us in 2015, including key initiatives that provide our company with greater strength and flexibility as we pursue our regulated growth plans. I'm also gratified by the response from the rating agencies. In December, citing our shift in strategy and more credit friendly business risk profile, Fitch revised its outlook from stable to positive. Days later, Moody's affirmed its Baa3 rating with a stable outlook for FirstEnergy Corp., FES and Allegheny Energy Supply, citing our Ohio ESP settlement. Over the past year, I've gotten to know many of you and I've shared my leadership philosophy, including my commitment to make our company more transparent. I hope you've seen that in action over the past year. I've told you one of our primary objectives is to improve the quality of our earnings. This year, two significant noncash adjustments got in the way. The annual mark-to-market for pension and OPEB will remain an annual adjustment, either up or down, and the impairment of the Signal Peak coal mine is required, given the current market for coal and the fact that this isn't a core asset for us. Outside of these two items, earnings quality in 2015 was very solid, and is supported with operational cash flows that showed a $700 million improvement over 2014. We are making solid progress, and once we have an outcome in our Ohio ESP, we should be in a position to provide 2016 full-year earnings expectations and shed more light on the next couple of years, including our regulated growth projections and any future equity needs to support our growth initiatives. It remains our priority to continue strengthening our balance sheet and further de-risk our Competitive business. These steps will help ensure we are well positioned to pursue the next period of regulated growth and success, benefiting our 6 million customers and the local economies we serve, our investors and our employees. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter. As always, we reserved plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. Our fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.58 per share compares to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a loss of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.73 per share during the same period last year. 2015 fourth quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $1.11 per share. I'll spend a few moments on two of those items before moving to the review of operating results. The first of these is the impairment charge related to our investment in the Signal Peak mine. As Chuck mentioned earlier on the call, given the weak market for coal globally, in the fourth quarter we wrote off our investment in Global Holding, the parent company of Signal Peak, resulting in a noncash pre-tax charge of $362 million or $0.56 per share, which reduced the value of this investment to zero. As some of you may remember, back in 2011, FirstEnergy sold a portion of its ownership interest in Signal Peak, receiving $258 million in cash proceeds and recognizing a $370 million after-tax gain which included a sizeable step-up in the one-third interest we retained. Presently, the mine remains operational and FirstEnergy continues to provide a full guarantee on Global Holding's $300 million term loan. Since this investment is no longer a strategic fit for FirstEnergy, we have moved the earnings associated with Signal Peak from our Competitive segment to Corporate/Other for all periods. The second special item is the $0.35 per share annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, another noncash item. As discussed in our third quarter call, we anticipated this charge given the plan's investment performance, which was partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate. I will note that for 2016 we have $381 million in required minimum pension funding, with $160 million already contributed to the plan last month. Let's spend some time walking through the fourth quarter drivers by business units, followed by a brief review of the full year. In our Distribution business total deliveries decreased 6% in the quarter or 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. Residential sales decreased 10.6% and commercial sales decreased 3.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our region saw the mildest fourth quarter temperatures in at least 35 years, with heating degree days that were nearly 30% below both last year and normal. The decrease in customer use also reflects the adoption of energy efficient lighting and the impact of other energy efficiency measures. We continue to analyze these efficiency trends and we plan to discuss the expected impact on our load forecast over the next few years when we hold our Analyst Meeting. Sales to industrial customers decreased 3.9% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, mining, chemical, electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. Distribution results were also impacted by higher operating expenses, which included planned reliability spend in the quarter, primarily at JCP&L. In our Transmission business fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which became effective in January 2015, partially offset by a lower return on equity at ATSI as part of its comprehensive settlement that was approved by FERC in October. In our Competitive business, we recorded strong fourth quarter operating earnings as higher commodity margin was offset with higher operating expenses. The impact of lower contract sales was offset by higher capacity revenues, lower purchased power, fuel and transmission expenses, and increased sales to the wholesale market, reflecting our more open position. Operating costs for the Competitive business were higher in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to expenses related to the nuclear refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2. Finally, at Corporate, a higher effective income tax rate and higher interest and operating expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.08, in line with our expectations. Now I'll take a couple of minutes to discuss full year results and review the key earnings drivers for 2015. Operating earnings were $2.71 per share compared to $2.56 in 2014. GAAP earnings were $1.37 per share in 2015 compared to $0.71 in the prior year. At our Regulated Distribution utilities, 2015 operating earnings were in line with our guidance. The net benefit of resolved rate cases and generally favorable weather was offset primarily by higher operating expenses associated with planned reliability maintenance. Total distribution deliveries decreased about 1% compared to 2014. In the Industrial segment sales declined primarily due to decreased steel and mining production. Sales to residential and commercial customers were essentially flat compared to the prior year. In the Regulated Transmission segment, operating earnings increased primarily as a result of a higher rate base and a forward-looking rate structure at ATSI in the company's Regulated Transmission business. In our Competitive business, operating earnings increased significantly, primarily due to improved commodity margin related to higher capacity prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $949 million in line with our expectations. You'll recall that we began the effort to reposition our sales portfolio in the second quarter of 2014. Our total retail customer count at the end of 2015 was 1.6 million, a decrease of 445,000 customers from December 31, 2014. We sold about 75 million megawatt hours in 2015, including 68 million megawatt hours of contract sales and an additional 7 million megawatt hours of wholesale. We currently have about 61 million megawatt hours committed for 2016 and for 2017 about 38 million megawatt hours are committed, or about half of our expected generation resources. The Ohio PPA would add approximately 23 million megawatt hours on an annual basis, which would essentially close our sales positions through the first half of 2017. In the Corporate segment, 2015 operating earnings were consistent with our guidance, reflecting higher interest and operating expenses as well as a more normal effective income tax rate. 2015 should be recognized as a pivotal year for our company. We were able to raise the operating earnings guidance that we provided, reduce risk and build a solid platform for regulated growth. We're confident that our efforts will help us reach our goal of creating long-term value for FirstEnergy shareholders. Now I'd like to open the call up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to discuss transmission spending opportunities. In your fact book I think it's slide 45, you talk about a review of the reliability in your ATSI system. And maybe that should be phrased more broadly, but just wanted to check-in in terms of as you assess transmission needs, replacement of 69-kV lines, 138-kV lines, what is your sense in terms of the potential for additional spending to enhance reliability in transmission in particular? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Stephen, we've talked about this a little bit in the past. Our team has identified in excess of $15 billion worth of projects that we could execute, all on our existing 24,000 miles of transmission lines. And that's our focus. And what we do with those projects is we prioritize them in the best way to drive benefits for customers. And my view is the best investments we can make are the ones that customers are willing to pay for and that you all are willing to invest in. So the opportunity is there for us to make these kind of investments for a long time; the ability to add on an annual basis to that is a little bit challenged by the availability of a transmission construction work force in our country. So I wouldn't expect that you would see a huge increase on an annual basis, but you could extrapolate out quite a bit into the future how long we can continue to execute this program. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. That makes sense. And wanted to shift over to the Ohio PPA discussions. I'm sure there will be many questions on this. At the FERC level, I guess comments are due February 23 or thereabouts, and I know this is obviously not your preferred outcome, but if the FERC case were to go in opposition to the PPAs, could you talk a little bit about what the implications might be, understanding again that that's not your preferred outcome? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Oh hi, Stephen. This is Leila. So I don't think it would be the likely outcome either, but \u2013 so let me spend a couple of seconds just kind of recount for the group what that would have actually entailed to get to that place. So right now we have an affiliate waiver and the basis upon which it was granted, those items have not changed. If you think about it, Ohio still, the customers are not captive. They can shop. There hasn't been a law change. That means that the Ohio Commission is still in order to approve the PPA would have to find that the ESP is better than the MRO. They would still be protecting customers. So if you look at those kind of things, again I don't think that it's something that the FERC should rescind, if you would. But if they were to do that, what would happen \u2013 they would likely apply the Edgar rule. So you could look at the different provisions of how they look at that. There's several ways to comply with the Edgar rule and one of them looks at non-price terms and conditions. So we would be looking at a hearing dealing with our PPA, and I think there are a lot of things that could be said around the non-term price and conditions that would allow the pricing to stand as well. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill from Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Two questions. The first one is regarding the Competitive business guidance for 2016. And I guess it was the same as it was in the third quarter look, despite the fact that wholesale power prices are down. Could you talk about what the drivers there were? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Sure, Gregg. This is Donnie. If you take a look at our slide 104 of the fact book you can see the EBITDA guidance. And as you clearly indicated, the fall-off in prices, we reflected that in our open position. We're down about $3 there. But we've also lowered our costs, especially our fossil fuel. We went back and took another hard look at some of the things we'd done in CFIP. We were able to lower that. Net of those two things, the lower revenue from the decline in the open position, net of what we've been able to do on the cost side, our commodity margin's only down about $15 million, which is well in the range of our EBITDA. Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then regarding the equity needs, can you talk about your thoughts there in light of some of the write-offs and funding needs that you have? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I've said pretty consistently that we have set a goal of strengthening our balance sheet and getting to where we need to get with the rating agencies without having to use any equity to do that. And I just don't believe that that is the intent of shareholder equity. We've worked very hard this past year. I talked about the results of CFIP. We've also made improvements in other parts of our operation, and then we've got the entire Ohio ESP to get a resolution on before I think we're in any position to talk about what future equity needs might be. We talked about $245 million of incremental investment in Pennsylvania distribution. Under the Ohio ESP there's an extension of the DCR rider plus potential opportunities to invest in increasing the smart distribution network in Ohio. Along with transmission with ATSI, transmission with MAIT, what we need to do and what we plan to do is communicate to you what type of regulated growth rate we're going to strive for going forward, once we have these last remaining questions done. And then any equity needs are going to be driven off of that. They are not going to be driven off of a need for equity to deal with any of the financial issues that we've been trying to wrestle to the ground this last year. They will only be used for growth, and that's our intent. Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: What's your current thinking around when the Ohio Commission will rule, and kind of what's your outlook for potential that \u2013 that schedule getting delayed? And if it were delayed beyond the PJM auction, how would it impact your bidding behavior? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as I said in my comments, we're expecting an answer from the Ohio Commission in March. And so I don't think it's going to affect our bidding behavior one way or another. Our Competitive generating business bids in our Competitive fleet. We have regulated generation in West Virginia already that is bid by a regulated generation group. The two do not talk, as required by FERC's Standards of Conduct. This generation will get bid in by one of those two groups, depending on which side of the fence it's on. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can you remind us what the original investment in Signal Peak was? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : We made an original cash contribution, about $150 million. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And you sold a piece for what, you said $230 million? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. That's \u2013 we sold 50% of our interest and we had a cash proceeds of about $234 million. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. I'm good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Dan. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): First question just on \u2013 a couple of cash flow questions for you guys, first off. How should we think about bonus depreciation affecting kind of the cash flows coming back in? And how does that get treated at the different utilities/transmission assets as far as adjusting rate base? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Dan, this is Jim. Bonus depreciation, we were already in a large NOL position through the 2018 and 2019 period, so this is just going to extend that beyond 2021. Obviously these years will change somewhat with the approval of the PPA scenario. On the earnings side, it's really a modest impact from a rate base reduction. We'll see a little bit on the transmission side and certain of our other jurisdictions that have formula like rate recovery such as the DCR in Ohio. But I would say the impact to our earnings rate base is going to be minimal. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So should we assume \u2013 what kind of cash tax rate are you guys assuming through 2021? Are you at an AMT or sub-AMT level then? K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller: Hey, Dan. This is Jon Taylor. We're at the AMT level. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then I guess on the pension side, did I read it correctly from the last quarter slides, this quarter slides, that your pension expenses are up about $55 million in 2016 versus 2015 on a pre-tax basis? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Dan. Two things that are driving that; first is we had a 25 basis point decrease in the return on assets. So we took that down from 7.75% to 7.5%. And then we also saw a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, which would increase our interest costs. So the two of those was about $50 million. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. And I guess if we look at the kind of, from the K, the five-year funding plans or obligations for pension are up about $600 million through the five-year running period from last K to this K. Do you guys see any funding obligations around that? Or is it \u2013 because this is kind of beyond 2016 we'll wait and see what happens in the interest rate environment between here and there? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Dan, what we have out there, and you're right, our five-year required contributions are about $500 million higher than what the five-year required contributions were in the 2014 10-K. Our actuary Aon, they recalibrate that annually. And at this point these are fundings that we would be required to make. As we said, we have a $381 million contribution required in 2016. We've already made $160 million in January. 2017, we have a $439 million pension contribution. That's down somewhat from where we were in the 2014 10-K where we had $555 million, but again that's associated with our actuary recalibrating when our payments are required and some of those payments were moved out to a future year. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. And I guess just last one on the ESP side in Ohio. Does it become a friction point where you have to have a decision in order to implement rates before ESP3 goes away? And how much time or how much cushion do you guys need between PUCO making a decision and you guys being ready to implement? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : So, yes. So it does become that point, but I think it's going to be a moot question because I fully expect the Commission to act in March. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So a decision in March gives you plenty of time. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Correct. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Yeah. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We can here you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. So let me just follow up on what Dan was asking there. First, on the bonus depreciation point, can you elaborate a little bit more on the earnings impact rather than the cash flow? And think about what it does separately to the Transmission and the Distribution side as you think about perhaps the next round of rate case and/or FERC filing? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : At this point, Julien, I would say that the impact on each of the segments would just be pennies. It would not be material at all. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Could you elaborate why that would be, just be clear, just as you think about? Is that principally because you haven't filed, or you don't necessary have a meaningful distribution case contemplated? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. At this point on the Distribution side, it would only impact the utilities that we have formula-like rates considering the DCR in Ohio. We have rates that are in effect in all of our other jurisdictions will likely be looking to go in for rates in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but that will not be \u2013 we won't see changes to our rates probably until the 2017 timeframe at this point, but we'll give you more clarification on that when we have our Analyst Day Meeting. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : And just to clarify Analyst Day expectations, if there is indeed an issue at FERC, I suppose a, you would expect to host your Analyst Day would be in terms of providing guidance, should we continue to expect EBITDA guidance kind of status quo as you laid out? If the 206 is successful. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, I think here's where we're at. We're going to wait till we get the outcome in Ohio. Once we have that then we're going to give you a little clearer guidelines on what we're expecting in terms of our Analyst Meeting. One way or another we're going to be giving you guidance for 2016 that includes the ESP or doesn't include the ESP based on where we're at, at that point in time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then lastly on the Signal Peak assets, what's the situation in terms of the servicing the debt, just the guarantee there? If you can just elaborate in terms of the assets itself? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Okay, Julien. This is Jim. From servicing the debt, the mine continues to service that debt. The only time that we would have a change there is if we become more of a full-time owner of the mine if we would have control of over 50% of that. The first step we would have to do is likely consolidate that debt on to our balance sheet. Right now it's not consolidated because we're only a 33% owner. And then ultimately if there was a capital call that the other owners were not able to fulfill that would also likely require us to make that capital call. At the end, of that $300 million, $100 million is purely ours because we own a 33% interest in that and once we understand fully what happens to the mine, if it would happen to shut down then we would be responsible to fill that obligation to the banks. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : The balance of the obligation. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. How are you? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just on, a quick question here. In terms of the PPA associated generation, how much of that if you could remind me, cleared in the 2018/2019 auction? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: This is Donny, Paul. So Sammis and Beaver Valley it all cleared in the 2018/2019 auction. I'm sorry, Sammis and Davis-Besse, it all cleared in the 2018/2019 auction. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then you guys brought up sort of an interesting issue here in terms of how your generation in the PPA would be similar to regulated generation, et cetera. And I don't recall when the Harrison Plant acquisition by the regulated affiliate in Virginia was \u2013 or West Virginia, excuse me, was being purchased, this much of an issue in terms of opposition, et cetera, from generators, et cetera. Why do you think in this case it's being so much more of an issue than it would be in the Harrison case when it sounds to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, the economics would kind of be similar in terms of the impact on the market? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I am at a complete loss for why it is such a big issue for others, because I do think it is financially the same as what happened with Harrison. These units will no longer supply retail load. They will no longer supply polar load. They are not going to influence the competitive market in any way. So I'm at a complete loss for why it has generated such adamant opposition other than potentially misery loves company. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : And if I could add on just a little bit to that. So if you think about the parade of horribles that EPSA and others highlighted in their complaint to FERC, they talked about if you let these generating units look regulated, have in effect what they called an out of market subsidy, that would crash the marketplace. Well, if you think about PJM, as Chuck alluded to earlier, 20% of PJM is already regulated. And that doesn't even include the FRR entities. And if you think about what they were talking about, the bidding aspect of this, it's public information that prior to capacity performance three-quarters, so 75% of the megawatts in the PJM capacity auctions bid at zero. So they bid at price takers. And after CP it was about roughly half. But if you think about it with the new penalty, that what you associated with that penalty should kind of be your new zero. So I would suggest that the new price takers is actually even higher than 50%. So what that would suggest is some of the generators who actually filed this and complained so loudly saying that it was going to crash the market, they themselves actually bid into the capacity market at zero. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the... James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Paul, and just to be clear on the capacity, I said it all cleared. In actuality when you look at our fact book on slide 119, you'd see that there were 525-megawatts in ATSI that did not clear. And... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I'm sorry. Go ahead. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : A slice of that may be at Sammis and Davis-Besse, but essentially it all cleared. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : What do you \u2013 why would a slice of it not (44:20), I guess? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Well, to the degree we bid all of our units on a curve, there could be a slice that didn't clear. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. That would be Sammis and Davis-Besse? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, generally we bid all of our units on a curve, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. But I mean I guess what I'm wondering, though, is that of the PPA-affiliated plants, some of it may have cleared and some of it may not have cleared. Is that correct? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : It would not look any different than the rest of our unregulated plants, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Just to get back to Julien's question on the \u2013 just to make sure I understand on the Global Holding guarantee, the $300 million. It wasn't clear to me exactly how much on the hook you guys are if the Signal Peak mine becomes uneconomic or unable to \u2013 and you don't get the capital calls from third parties. How much would be the total risk that you guys may or may not have? I'm just \u2013 it wasn't clear completely. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : The total amount would be $300 million, less any types of proceeds that we could get from the sale of the mine. So if we cannot sell the mine for anything, the maximum would be $300 million. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Assuming that there is some value to the mine, we would be able to use those proceeds to reduce that amount of exposure. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning. Just two quick questions I guess on the PPA is first, do you think FERC rules before the May PJM auction? And second, you had mentioned the waiver earlier, that you have a waiver between your utility and competitive generation. Is the waiver unique to a particular PPA or is it I guess for any PPA that goes between your utility and competitive businesses? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : This is Leila. So it covers all the transactions between the utilities and the affiliates. And again, the basis upon which it was granted, the circumstances haven't changed. The Commission still retains the ability to protect customers. And I apologize, I forgot your first question? Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just do you think FERC rules before the auction in May? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Oh, whether it will rule, I'm sorry. Yes. Nothing's carved in stone and they don't have to. EPSA asked for expedited treatment, but most people believe that they will act before the auction and probably act on the filed paper as opposed to holding a hearing. That would be my best guess. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just quickly then, has FERC ever reversed policy and revoked a waiver? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : I don't know the entire history, but I could tell you what FERC has done with regard to captive customers and shopping. FERC on several occasions has been asked to kind of look behind the curtain and opine whether a state's particular flavor of retail choice is what they would agree with or not. And FERC has consistently said no, as long as they're not captive customers, as long as they can shop, then we're not going to try and second guess what commissions do. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Hi, guys. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Sorry to go on the PPA question again, but I'm just trying to understand the other side. And I know this is clearly not the preferred path, but if the PPA does get cancelled for whichever partner or how it gets cancelled, I'm just trying to paint a picture first from an equity needs perspective and also from a strategic fit perspective. As in, if you do see the PPA getting cancelled, is there any view on how the equity need requirement changes, especially to support the credit? And secondly, strategically do you see this business as still a fit within FE? Or do you look to do an exit in some form at some point? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first off we have not communicated any earnings guidance for full year 2016, whether the PPA gets done or not, and I'm not going to do that here this morning. What I've said is we will deal with that outcome when we have it, and we will communicate at that time what our earnings guidance for 2016 is, what our future growth plans for the utilities are, what our future equity needs might be, if anything, to support that growth. So I think you're just going to have to be patient and wait for the outcome, and then we'll tell you where we're at at that point in time. And beyond that I've consistently said I think that Generation, Transmission and Distribution are all critical assets in terms of serving customers. And right now I don't see any strategic change there for us. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. And on the second question, if I look at the generation of the Competitive business and I look at the... Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I would remind you that in my remarks I told you that this business is generating positive EBITDA, positive cash flow through 2018 without any benefit from the Energy Security Plan. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Gotcha. And that's a great lead-in actually to my second question which is, as I think about that positive free cash flow, I guess an important part of that is just the different channels that you sell your generation through. And LCI looks like an important piece of that puzzle. The range that you generally provide for LCI is in the zero to 20-terawatt hours of sales in that LCI direct. 2017 looks like it's just at 5 terawatt hours right now. And clearly it's early days and you're waiting for the PPA. But is there \u2013 the reason why I'm focused on it is, the LCI price versus the spot price, there's like almost a $20 per megawatt hour difference. So I'm just trying to put a lower bound on that LCI sale, as in, at a minimum what level do you see achieving at LCI or LCI channel sales in the 2016/2017 timeframe? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: So this is Donny. I think actually if you look at slide 104 in the fact book it shows LCI, MCI and mass market we've got 16.4 terawatt hours closed already for 2016 delivery. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): No, I'm looking at 2017 and LCI for 2017 is 5 terawatt hours which is what I'm looking at. Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Oh, yeah sure. Yeah. We've got a ways to go there. LCI customers generally are shorter terms contracts compared to government aggregation for example. So it would not be unusual to be able to close 10 terawatt hours or 15 terawatt hours in a year prior to the delivery year. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. And do you expect those prices to be at similar levels to where you currently cleared which is around $54 per megawatt hour, $55 per megawatt hour? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: That's more difficult to say, because what you got to keep in mind embedded in that price is the price of capacity. So a customer in ATSI in the 2015/2016 timeframe is going to look different than a RTO customer and that's going to look different than a customer in the 2017/2018 timeframe. So it's very hard for us to say kind of what price we would end up locking those in at. What I would tell you is we would have consistent margins. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research : Good morning. This will be quick I think. In comparing the fact sheets, it looks like the transmission spend you're projecting a little up for 2016, lower in 2017. But nothing has changed with respect to Energizing the Future. I mean the overall project is pretty much on track from the way you initially set it up a couple of years ago, correct? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct. Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research : That's the only question I had. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, well there are no more questions in the queue. I'd just like to thank you all for your continued support. I look forward to getting our answer from Ohio here in a few weeks and then look forward to meeting you all face to face at the Analyst Meeting following that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Meghan. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016 and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.78 per share. While Jim will review our financial results in more detail, I want to quickly mention that we produced quality results and met our operating earnings guidance, despite the impact of an unseasonably mild winter and low power prices. The successful implementation of our economic dispatch strategy was key to that outcome because the fuel savings that resulted from idling some units when market prices did not support them, helped to offset the other impacts of mild temperatures across the company, particularly in our Distribution business. In addition to meeting our financial commitments to you, we continue to implement our regulated growth strategies. We have several positive developments on that front, and we will provide more detail today on our next steps to ensure continued service reliability for our customers with appropriate recovery of our investments. Let's start in Ohio, where the Public Utilities Commission completed a comprehensive nearly two-year review of our Powering Ohio's Progress Electric Security Plan and unanimously approved the plan with certain modifications. The PUCO concluded that the approved plan promotes rate stability and retail competition and adds value for Ohio customers, communities and the environment. I would both like to compliment and thank our Public Utilities Commissioners and staff for their leadership and handling a very complex regulatory matter. I am proud of this ESP and of the entire team that worked on it. The plan helped to safeguard customers against rising energy prices in future years while preserving key power plants that serve Ohio customers ensuring fuel diversity and maintaining Ohio jobs. In addition, it outlined steps to support low income customers, reinstate energy efficiency programs, evaluate smart grid technologies, and includes a goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It truly fulfills the principles that the Ohio legislature outlined for the Electric Security Plans when they moved the state toward retail competition. Currently, it's been a long and conscientious process to get to this point and while PUCO approval is a critical milestone, there are still challenges at FERC. Our opponents have also expressed their intent to bring court challenges. I will quickly review our position on these issues and Leila can address your additional questions during the Q&A. First, we believe FERC should affirm the waiver that is already in place. You'll recall that FES was granted authorization from FERC to conduct certain transactions with our Ohio utilities in 2008. Our Purchase Power Agreement is one of those transactions. It was carefully constructed from the beginning to comply with existing FERC rules that promote customer shopping for retail energy supply and it will not hinder the PJM markets ability to function and foster competition. A separate complaint asked FERC to impose a price for on the PPA units for the May 2016 PJM, RPM capacity auction. We don't believe there's any reason for our PPA units to be treated differently than any of the other regulated generation in PJM. It's no secret that a significant amount of generation, both regulated and merchant has been offered into prior PJM options with price taking behavior. Some of these complaints are likely in that group of suppliers. What they are asking FERC to do is essentially have FirstEnergy protect them from themselves. We have filed a strong answer demonstrating that a price floor is not needed and challenging the economic theory behind the opposition's price floor methodology. And we do not expect that FERC will impose a price floor on the PPA units for the upcoming auction. With regards to the other potential challenges, we believe that the PUCOs decision is well within the Commission's authority and we expect it will withstand subsequent challenges. Furthermore, the notion of non-bypassable charges on Ohio utility bills is not new, as charges for programs such as energy efficiency, economic development and low income support, as well as cost to support the bulk Transmission System have been in place for years. Given that FERC could make an announcement on the issues before them very soon, we are holding off on providing a second quarter operating earnings guidance. Once we do have additional clarity from FERC, we expect to have a better picture of our full-year 2016 outlook, and we will offer you further details and guidance. I know this decision may seem inconsistent with our stated objective to improve transparency and disclosures. We remain committed to giving you the information you need to evaluate our company when we know it. DSP is simply too significant to speculate on its outcome. While we do anticipate filing for a rehearing on the ESP IV by May 2, to address a few items of clarification, we're moving forward to implement the PPA that was entered into on April 1. As you know, our Regulated Generation Group has experienced selling the output for Mon Powers regulated units at Fort Martin and Harrison into PJM. They're using that experience and have retained a leading industry consultant to help prepare strategies and offer formation for the Davis-Besse and Sammis Plants in advance of the May, PJM capacity auction. The regulated team plans to sell the output from Davis-Besse and Sammis into PJM as of June 1. We're also laying the groundwork to meet the provisions outlined in the terms of the ESP IV. In late February, we submitted our grid modernization business plan, which outlined the menu of options for the PUCO. We also filed our Energy Efficiency Plan with the Commission earlier this month and by November 1, we will file a carbon reduction report that outlines our fuel diversification and carbon reduction strategies. In the ESP, we proposed a CO2 reduction goal of at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045, building on the 25% reduction in CO2 emissions already achieved across our footprint. This goal represents a potential reduction of more than 80 million tons of CO2 emissions and is among the most aggressive targets in the utility industry. In support of our commitment to a cleaner energy future, we launched a branding campaign in February called The Switch is On. This campaign highlights our environmental achievements, transition to a cleaner energy sources, and our Green electricity options. Earlier this month, we entered into a unique Green energy pact with the Cleveland Indians to provide Progressive Field with 100% Green-e certified wind energy from FirstEnergy Solutions. We also introduced an Earth Day promotion inviting Ohio and Pennsylvania residents to sign up for 100% wind energy at the same price as the standard energy offer. Turning to other regulatory matters, our proposed Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary known as MAIT, received FERC approval in late February. As we have discussed, this subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L, and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for these customers. Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania ALJs issued an initial decision approving a settlement filed by the parties resolving all issues in this case. We anticipate final approval from the Pennsylvania PUC by mid-year. And last week, we made a supplemental filing in New Jersey seeking to transfer certain JCP&L distribution assets into MAIT, which we believe should satisfy the concerns regarding public utility status that were addressed by the BPU in February. We will continue to work with the BPU because we believe transferring these assets to MAIT is the right thing to do for our New Jersey customers. As we mentioned in February, we have passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment program with $2.4 billion invested through 2015 on projects designed to make our system more robust, secure, and resistant to extreme weather events. This program remains on track, and we continue to view the Transmission business as our primary growth platform for many years to come. Over the past two years, we have been focused on removing regulatory uncertainty and positioning our regulated businesses for growth. Tomorrow, we plan to file rate cases for JCP&L and our four Pennsylvania utilities that are consistent with our goals of enhancing customer service and reliability, strengthening the distribution system, improving security, and adding resiliency and operating flexibility to our infrastructure, while providing stability and growth for the company. In Pennsylvania, our four utilities will file rate plans with the Public Utilities Commission aimed at extending the service reliability improvement efforts that have yielded significant results for more than 2 million customers. Since 2011, the number of power outage impacting our Pennsylvania customers has decreased by an average of about 27%, while restoration times have improved by an average of about 14% in that same period. In total, our request would result in an expected revenue increase totaling $430 million across four Pennsylvania utilities, and we've broken down the impact by operating company in the Appendix of our slide presentation. These changes would bring the average monthly bills in line with the typical residential bills for the other three major electric utilities in the state, while benefiting customers by modernizing the grid with smart technologies, increased vegetation management activities and continuing customer service enhancements. Pending PUC approval, we anticipate that the new rates will take effect in January of 2017. The new base rates at the Pennsylvania utilities would also include recovery of costs associated with our long term infrastructure improvement plans, which include a projected increase in capital investments of $245 million over five years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. We expect to begin recovering the cost of those programs in July through the distribution system improvement charges that are currently pending Pennsylvania PUC approval. We also plan to file a rate plan with the New Jersey BPU that supports and builds on the significant service reliability improvements made by JCP&L in recent years. The planned $142-million rate request seeks to improve service and benefit customers by supporting equipment maintenance, vegetation management and inspections of lines, poles and substations, while also compensating for other business and operating expenses. The JCP&L plan is designed to extend the service reliability improvements and helped the utility achieve its best service reliability record in more than a decade last year. While JCP&L's rates have remained stable and even declined over the past decade, our operating expenses have continued to increase. Since July 2012, JCP&L has invested $612 million in service-related enhancement projects. And even with the proposed 6% overall rate increase for the average residential customer, JCP&L would continue to offer the lowest residential electric rates among the four regulated electric distribution companies in New Jersey. You will remember that our last rate case in New Jersey, which was based on a 2011 test year, was complicated due to storm recovery expense issues and other items. In the upcoming proceeding, which satisfies the BPU requirement that we file a new rate case by April of 2017, we hope for a reasonable timeline in recognition of the significant investments we have made. Allowing for a thorough review of our filing, we will request the new rates to go into effect in January of 2017. We remain focused on continuing to position our company for growth and success to best serve our customers, communities, investors and employees. Now, I would turn the call over to Jim for his review of the quarter. And as always, we will have plenty of time for your questions at the end of his remarks. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. I'm sure you have also noticed that we did not publish a full FactBook this quarter. We hope to have greater clarity to regarding the PPA shortly, which would hopefully allow us to have an analyst meeting and provide full guidance for 2016. In place of the FactBook, we have included an Appendix to the slides for today's call with certain regulatory and financial updates we would normally publish each quarter. Our first-quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share compares to $0.62 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, we recorded earnings of $0.78 per share for the first quarter of 2016, compared to $0.53 per basic share during the same period last year. 2016 first quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $0.02 per share, which includes regulatory charges primarily related to economic development and energy efficiency programs associated with the Ohio ESP commitments, offset by mark-to-market gains on commodity contracts. A full listing of the special items can be found on page two of the consolidated report. In our Distribution business, results were impacted primarily by mild temperatures on distribution deliveries and lower rates in New Jersey that went into effect in 2015, partially offset by the benefit of Pennsylvania rates that were also implemented last year. Total distribution deliveries decreased 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2015 with a 13.4% decrease in residential sales and a 5.1% decrease in commercial sales, reflecting heating degree days that were 25% below last year and 11% below normal. On a weather adjusted basis, residential deliveries were essentially flat while commercial deliveries decreased 1.6%. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.8%. We do continue to see growth in shale gas sector but the rate has slowed dramatically in the past two years and is not enough to offset lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. First-quarter Industrial load was off nearly 110 gigawatt hours as a result of reduced operations at Republic Steel, which then announced an indefinite shutdown on April 1 and a permanent closure of Warren Steel. Overall, our sales are following the national trend that was noted by the Energy Information Association earlier this year. Whether-adjusted residential and commercial sales are each down more than 1% over the past four quarters while industrial load is down 3% in that timeframe. Drivers include the impact of more efficient lighting, appliances and equipment and slowing and shifting economic growth. In our Transmission business, operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base at ATSI, partially offset by the lower return on equity that was part of ATSI's comprehensive settlement approved by FERC last fall. In our Competitive business, strong first quarter earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, as well as lower purchased power expense, higher wholesale sales and lower fossil fuel expense. These factors offset lower contract sales volume, which decreased in line with our hedging strategy. The decrease in fossil fuel expense relates to lower fuel rigs, and as Chuck indicated earlier, it also reflects the benefits for our economic dispatch strategy, which kept the Bruce Mansfield Plant offline for part of February and March. This strategy is the right approach at this time and we will continue to deploy it if markets don't support plant operations. Clearly, this remains a very challenging business environment for our competitive units as prices continue to drop. Although we're not updating our CES adjusted EBITDA guidance at this time. We know that a reduction of about $3 per megawatt-hour in the round-the-clock prices since the beginning of this year translates into a reduction of more than $50 million in wholesale revenue. Our committed sales are about 62 million megawatt-hours for 2016 with an additional 12 million megawatt-hours as part of the Ohio PPA. In 2017, we have 42 million megawatt-hours committed with an additional 20 million megawatt-hours for the Ohio PPA. We are reaffirming our expectations that the Competitive business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018. And finally, in Corporate, a higher consolidated income tax rate and other expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2015. As Chuck said, we're off to a very solid start in 2016, and we're encouraged by the developments in Ohio and remain committed to providing customer-focused growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I'd like to open the call up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning guys. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Could you give us a sense of what the drivers for the rate increase \u2013 the rate request in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are? I hear the comment that your rates are going to be \u2013 and it'll bring rates up to the average. But just what the big drivers are? And then maybe a sense of where the ROEs are tracking in the \u2013 to its various jurisdictions as you make these filings? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Jonathan, this is Jim. Let me take a shot at it and then I'll let Leila get into more detail if we need. First off, we're going to have an increase in our rate base. So, that will be part of it. We also have increased depreciation expense associated with our investments. We're also rolling in the DISC rider as part of this increase. We have smart meters and also there has been a decrease in sales, so that's going to be part of the driver there. So, those are primarily the major drivers. As I would say that there was not a defined ROE last year in the Pennsylvania case. So, it's hard to say if we're tracking to that. But, overall, I'd say our earnings in Pennsylvania are doing well, but because of these significant investments as well as the decrease in sales and the DISC rider, that is leading to the increase. And Leila, I don't know if you have anything to add to that? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Just one further point of clarification with respect to the \u2013 on the depreciation comment, and we're actually proposing a changed methodology in depreciation that's just driving some of that change. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is that just in Pennsylvania or in both? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Correct. Correct. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Is that a meaningful piece of it or just one of many? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : With regard to depreciation, it's roughly $31 million of the change. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks. So it sounds like, in general, this is not about returns. It's more about investments and the other things you listed. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : That's correct, Jonathan. Okay. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Jonathan I have said all along that as we continue to move this company more towards a regulated model and we prepare for growth in our T&D operations, you're going to see more and more rate increases or rate cases in order to accommodate that growth. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So fair enough. I think I had a 6% number mentioned for New Jersey. Did you provide a percentage on the Pennsylvania jurisdictions? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : It's \u2013 I think that's included in the Appendix Jonathan and when we break down all four of the Pennsylvania companies you have that rate increase. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, we'll see that, and thank you. And then one final thing, you commented that you're going to wait until you have clarity from FERC on giving Q2 guidance. But more broadly if, let's say, FERC doesn't act ahead of the upcoming auction and maybe there's a longer delay there, how should we think about this in the context of when you might have an Analyst Day and a broader update to the outlook? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think that our game plan is to wait and see what FERC does. If it drags on too long, then my expectation is we'll give you a guidance for 2016 without the ESP baked into it. That would be our plan. I don't expect that this is going to drag on a long time. There's a lot of speculation out there that they'll make a decision before the May RPM. That doesn't bother me so much if they don't because a lot of the opponent's cases suggesting that we're going to do something inappropriate in how we bid these units. And once they see how we bid these units, then I think that would diffuse a lot of that argument. So if it waits until after the RPM, that wouldn't bother me too much. But beyond that, I think if it continues to go on and we are going to give you guidance for 2016 without the ESP. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So we should probably anticipate by early summer, you'll be doing that then in any event? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Paul. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just a sort of follow-up on Jonathan's question and your answer, should we \u2013 it seems to suggest that perhaps your bidding behavior would be the same with or without the PPA. Is that an accurate or that there wouldn't be that big of a difference, how should we think about that? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're not going to talk about our bidding behavior. But I think it is something that FERC can look at. If they just look at how we bid our West Virginia plants in the last RFP or actually in \u2013 since capacity performance, they could see a very good indication of how we bid units on the regulated side. We haven't disclosed that bidding behavior and we don't plan to. But my point is this. I don't think that \u2013 I think there's a lot of rhetoric going on about how these PPAs might affect the capacity market. It's nothing, but rhetoric. This PPA has no impact on the PJM market whatsoever. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, in terms of your expectation that they will probably take action before the auction, which is coming right up, is that with respect to all three cases or \u2013 excuse me \u2013 to the both cases for you, or one in particular? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Hi, Paul, this is Leila. Given the high profile, I guess my view on this would be that they would be looking at both these cases before the Base Residual Auction. Just to give clarity, from the way I view the world, if you think about the affiliate waiver case, if I'm the chairman, he looks at things from a legalistic standpoint. I kind of view things that same way. And so I have a case in front of me where there's strong precedence not to look behind the screen if you were to what the states are doing. He has \u2013 in the initial 2008 waiver, there was a claim by Nopak that non-bypassable charges should be looked at and should cause him to say that there're not \u2013 not all the customers \u2013 that there are captive customers. They chose not to make that finding. So to go against this and grant the complaint, he would have to go against legal precedent. I don't see him doing that and I think he would want to get that out of the way and that's tied to Mon Power complaint because fundamentally they're kind of looking to address, call it the same issue. And if you look at the Mon Power complaint, there are a lot of parties with \u2013 that wait in with a lot of different potential remedies. And I don't think they're going to fall prey to the hyperbole, especially out there by Dynegy that there is a burning platform that there is imminent danger. If they're going to want to act and give clarity and take their time and look at this. So from my standpoint, I think they're going to want to act on the waiver, I think they are going to deny the complaint because I think it's \u2013 to do otherwise would be inconsistent with past precedent. They can take care of the issues supposedly involved in that complaint, in the Mon Power complaint, but they can do so in a very thoughtful way by addressing it through the stakeholder process what they are used to dealing with it and taking care of it in the next \u2013 for the next BRA auction in 2017. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : I just wanted to give clarity to the market in that regard. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : That makes sense. And then just finally, I apologize if I missed this. The $0.09 charge \u2013 regarding the regulatory charge, what was that associated with? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : The regulatory charge, that was primarily the commitment we made under the ESP, and that's associated with some energy efficiency commitments, as well as some low income and some economic development. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And it's a one-timer? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : It's a one-timer. Since we committed to make those payments, so we're required to recognize that at the time of the commitment. It is a liability to us. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Thanks so much. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Could we just write-off just a couple of policy questions, here? Can we touch on what we're hearing a little bit on Chairman Porter's potential resignation? The timing is a little bit suspect and it's a crucial period. Could we get some clarity there? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I will give you my comments. I think that Chairman Porter showed outstanding leadership during the time he was at the Commission. You know, he got a very important docket moved forward. Hate to see him go, but as you know how it goes. When job opportunities present themselves, you don't get to pick the timing of them. So he called me the other day and we had a good conversation, and I don't think you should read anything into it other than what was said. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe a question directed to Leila. So the Supreme Court ruling in Maryland obviously net-net most saw it as a negative, but obviously some of the Justices gave some guidance around what would be from a legal standpoint possible. They clearly drew some distinctions between Maryland and New Jersey versus what you're proposing in Ohio. So I'd like to get maybe your opinion here on what you thought of the Supreme Court ruling. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : So net-net, I actually think it's quite positive. So you may recall the Maryland case was out there when we first constructed the PPA. So we knew we were kind of threading the needle with regard to that, and I think that the Supreme Court's decision confirms that we did a good job of that. The decision in and of itself does not negatively impact it. In fact, if you look at one of the footnotes, they go into a long detailed description of the traditional bilateral contract, which mirrors directly our PPA. So from a structure standpoint, if you think about it, through that footnote, they signaled that the structure of the PPA is something that is out there in the market and that they feel comfortable with. So structurally, I think it meets the test. And then if you go back to the EPSA case, albeit (33:57) they made a statement that insulating retail customers from price fluctuations is something that fell under state authority. So if what the Commission's purpose was was appropriate per EPSA and the structure is appropriate per the Hughes decision, I think again those two together present us a very strong case with regard to any Federal District Court case that might be brought our way. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. So it's just fair to say that if something if you get a negative outcome at FERC and this does gets taken up by the Supreme Court, it's a pretty good standing. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : I think it's an excellent standing. Thank you. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Okay good. And just one last question, Chuck, on, sort of, having had an update on the equity. But if FERC decides to take up this case, and this, sort of, gets drawn out a little bit, how should we, sort of, think about your equity needs? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you should think about it the way I have been answering it for the last year-and-a-half. And that is we can't make a determination until we have all of these answers, and I don't expect that it's going to be a lengthy FERC process. So \u2013 and my position from the beginning has been \u2013 it's our obligation to structure this company and operate it in a way where we could get our credit issues behind us without having to use equity to do that. We're talking to you about a lot of growth opportunities on the regulated distribution and transmission side. Assuming we get successfully done with MAIT, that opens up more transmission investment. And I'm not going to be embarrassed to tell you we want to use equity to help grow this company going forward. But the amount and the timing \u2013 I'm not ready to discuss. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering. Please proceed with your question. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I had a general question on the distribution strategy going forward. With lower sales growth, is the strategy to continue to file regular rate cases to compensate you for the increased spend or, in some jurisdictions are you looking to implement some sort of formula rate plans like you are with the DISC mechanism in Pennsylvania? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would answer that we have five different distribution strategies. We serve in five states. They all have different regulatory treatments. Under the Ohio ESP, we have an extension of the DCR through the term. We also have a new treatment for smart grid and smart meter type investments. So there is a different regulatory strategy in Ohio than in Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, we've got the LTIP and the DISC. And, obviously, we're filing for rate cases there and in New Jersey. In West Virginia, we had a case last year where, if we get to a position where we need another case, we'll file it. And in Maryland, quite frankly, the growth in load has been commensurate with our investments. And there has been no need to file a case there. So I think it's five different strategies. Overall, though, I would tell you the strategy is to start making the investments needed to improve the service to our customers beyond where we're at, to provide more security to the distribution network, and, basically, make investments to serve our customers better, and then do them in a way where we can communicate to you how we're going to get the returns. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then my second question was on the competitive generation side and the sensitivity to the open position. Can you remind us roughly how many terawatt hours or what percentage of your expected generation that you plan to keep open in any given year? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Yeah. This is Donny, Neel. Without the PPA, we have \u2013 our FactBook would show we have about 17 terawatt-hours open for 2016. I think Jim talked about the fact that a $3 move on that 17 terawatt-hours would be about a $50-million impact. With the PPA, if the PPA goes forward, we actually chew up some of that open position, as we look through the end of 2016. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then just last point of clarification on Pennsylvania. You say you're going to implement the DISC structure with this rate case. Would that help basically lengthen out the period between rate cases? Or is that just for a small portion of the distribution spend going forward? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually the DISC \u2013 we have filed for the DISC effective July 1 to start treating the first investments in our Long Term Infrastructure Plan. And under this rate case, any DISC expenditures after that point would be rolled into the base rates, and then we have the option going forward to then use the DISC in real-time to recover investments in the Long Term Infrastructure Plan in the outyears. So, we file to invest $245 million over the next five years. So, we're going to use both. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Hey, Brian. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Brian how are you doing? Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Very good. Very good. I just wanted to follow-up on the early equity issuance question just in a little bit more specific way. Can you provide your latest thoughts on timing or amount with regards to equity issuance just for Transmission purposes? And particularly if FERC is going to be delaying its response to the PPA question, does it make sense to potentially separate your equity issuance for transmission and not make that contingent on timing for FERC? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, so I've talked about in my comments the fact that we're halfway through energizing the future; we've invested $2.4 billion in our Transmission over the last two years with no equity. And during a time that we were working to kind of strengthen our cash flows in order to improve our credit metrics. We've got two more years of that program at about $1 billion a year. I don't see any equity needed to fund that Transmission growth. Going forward, if we plan to expand our Transmission investment program or expand significantly what we're doing in the distribution, then any equity needs would be associated with increased investment in T&D. So, I answered the same way we're not prepared to say what that amount is, but I don't think you need to be worried about energizing the future being taken off-track in any case. Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Very good. Thanks. That's all I've got. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Julien. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So, following up perhaps where we started on the rate cases, can you remind us where we stand on earned ROEs in kind of a trailing basis for 2015? Just I suppose speaking to the rate case filing itself for whatever you have out there, both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And perhaps on a prospective basis, the purpose for the case, at least New Jersey, seems to be recovering O&M, and then separately Pennsylvania seems principally driven by the implementation of the DISC and spending investments there, is that kind of good (42:21) them respectively? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Julien, this is Jim. I would say that in Pennsylvania, it's primarily driven by somewhat the decrease in the load. It's part of the DISC filing that we have. There's also additional investments that we've made there. We've got a very large smart meter implementation program going on over there. So that's primarily what's driving that in Pennsylvania. You're also able to file on the forward-looking test year. When I look at New Jersey, it's primarily driven by a significant amount of investment that we've made since the last test year in New Jersey, and that was 2011. And as we said in our remarks since July of 2012, we've had a significant amount of capital investment. And why we say partway through 2012, because in the test year New Jersey you're allowed to claim in-service amounts for six months after the in-service date. So we've had a significant amount of investment in New Jersey, so that's what's driving that. Again, as far as our overall return on equity within each of the states, I would say that we're probably tracking right around where we should, based on the last rate proceedings. However, as you know, in Pennsylvania, they did not publish what the ROE was in the settlement. Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Julien, this is Leila. The only thing that I would add when you're thinking about Pennsylvania, think about aggressive energy efficiency measures and no lost distribution recovery. So when Jim was talking about the lower revenue, those factors play into that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then, turning to the equity piece of the equation, just to be clear on setting expectations, we shouldn't expect to hear from you on equity until you get a definitive decision to either reject or accept the waiver \u2013 well, not the waiver, but the decision outright from FERC, and no action from the credit rating agencies correspondingly until that's well (44:46). Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Correct. I would say, yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Prior - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. This is actually Kevin. Other than the PPA, are there any other uncertainties or hurdles that would prevent you from giving guidance in the early summer? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Kevin Prior - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And if the FERC was to uphold the contracts, but it ended up going to the Ohio Supreme Court, would you still plan to implement the contracts on June 1, or would it then be delayed? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We plan to implement them on June 1. Kevin Prior - Evercore Group LLC : No matter what challenges there. Okay. That's all I have. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the supply side of the business. And ex the PPA, if you just look at the performance over the past couple of quarters, I think specifically, excluding the change in capacity prices and excluding the change in the volume. You've had a pretty noticeable improvement there, despite decline in commodity prices. Maybe you could just flush that out a little bit more and give us a color there. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I'll start and then I'll let Donny add to it. During 2015, we talked with you about our cash flow improvement program. Much of that was focused on the Competitive business. And much of that was focused on getting our Competitive business to the point where it continues to be cash flow positive and it has no need for any cash from the parent through 2018 at current energy prices as we know them. So part of that was also targeted at the FFO from the Generation business. So we reduced O&M expenditures, which contributed to some of what you're seeing there. So that's kind of from an operational perspective, the thing that Jim Lash and his Generation team have done to improve the competitiveness of that business. I will let Donny talk a little bit about the Commodity side. Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Yes, I'd just add, obviously we have taken a position starting after the polar vortex in 2014 to derisk the business and to move away from weather sensitive load. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2015 we had what's been referred to as the Siberian Express and while it was not nearly as significant of an impact to FES as the polar vortex, it's still have some impact. I'm happy to report this past quarter, although we had very mild weather, the fact that we have much less weather sensitive load, are results were pretty much in line with our expectations from a sales perspective. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Donny and his team are doing a fantastic job running the business too. Back in February when we had Mansfield off for two weeks, the entire plant off, there were several seller side notes that suggested that, meant that load was down and we're going to have a bad quarter. In reality, that's part of how we're dispatching is those units differently. So we don't run them when we can't make money with them. So I talked in my remarks about that save this fuel. So Donny is doing a great job at looking at every day, every hour, how do we maximize that business under some very difficult economic times. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I mean, to that point is there anything that we should think about historically that's forced you to run units that were uneconomic, such as mandatory take-or-pay coal contracts or something of that nature that would be rolling off this year or in the future, to kind of provided a tailwind for your numbers all else equal or I might barking up the wrong tree there? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead Donny. Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Yeah. I mean, we've had coal contracts in place for a lot of years. It gives us significant flexibility. This isn't really something new for us. I think the degree is much greater now, but you'll recall back in \u2013 I believe it was 2012 \u2013 around August 2012, we took the entire Sammis Plant down and kept it offline through December. So it's not really new. I think the difference is with the weak \u2013 incredibly weak forward day ahead market that we are seeing, it calls in more economic dispatch than perhaps what we had seen in the past. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then shifting gears to transmission again, the rejection by New Jersey of your utility status for that MAIT request would seem on the surface to be a significant setback. But your comments have indicated that you're going to continue to push forward, and you think it's very important. Could you maybe characterize how important the New Jersey part of MAIT program is to the overall transmission spend kind of levels going forward and growth going forward, and the timing now that you have had this setback, if it's been adjusted at all in New Jersey (50:18)? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, first I would say, I think MAIT is very important to our customers in New Jersey. And we have to do a better job of helping the BPU understand why it is important. We've done that in our latest filing and will continue to work with them to get it across the finish line. If we don't, then we'll look at options to implement MAIT in Pennsylvania potentially. But as far as your real question in terms of how does it affect or transmission investment strategy, we've got two more years of energizing the future. We've got projects beyond that inside ATSI and TrAILCo that we can continue to move forward with. I don't see MAIT been crucial at all to our transmission investment strategy. I see it as a way to implement that transmission investment strategy in a way where we can lower the cost of capital and do it in a way that's better for customers and create more transparency for our investors. That's how I see it. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Most of my questions have been addressed. I just wanted to focus on the Pennsylvania revenue request. When I look at the Appendix, it looks like the customer bill impacts can be relatively significant. I think one of the jurisdictions, it's about 18%, if I'm reading the page correctly. Is there a way to phase that out in order to otherwise lessen the overall bill impact, and are there other precedents we can look to in Pennsylvania in terms of just how to think about that, that it looks like a fairly sizeable rate impact? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Stephen, this is Jim. I would say that, as we said earlier in our comments and Chuck said, it is that this will bring the average residential bill in Pennsylvania up to \u2013 about what's average within the state. You'll recall we went a number of years without increasing our rates in the State of Pennsylvania. It's also being offset by a \u2013 from a customer perspective, it's being offset by a reduction in their overall energy component of the bill. So, I don't view this as something it's going to be what would be described as a rate shock issue. As far as your earlier request, no I don't \u2013 we don't see any mechanism out there where we would phase this in. This is just a normal type of request that we would have. And again as Leila pointed out earlier, there is very stringent energy efficiency requirements in the State of Pennsylvania, which is decreasing the usage. So we're required to go in and file for these rates. So that's the way we're looking at it. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And in terms of the magnitude of the benefit from lower energy costs, is there a way for us to get a sense for the magnitude of that benefit? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you could probably look at where wholesale power prices have gone over the last few years. And as Donny mentioned, wholesale power prices have fallen $3.00 already this year. So I think there was a period of time when around-the-clock power prices were in the $50-plus range, and if you look at the forwards out there right now, over the next three years, they're probably closer to the $30 range. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please proceed with your question. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Good morning, and congrats. One thing I was just wanted to help in terms of trying to measure these rate cases in terms of earnings potential. Is there some way you could give us what the increase in kind of rate base would be from kind of like what you have in your numbers this year versus \u2013 because it's a forward test year next year, could you signify the increase in rate base for the two jurisdictions? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I will answer it at a high level, and if you want details, then I'll let Leila and Jim fill in. But as filed, in effect January of next year, the JCP&L case is about $0.20 a share and the Pennsylvania cases combined are about $0.40 a share. Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP : Okay. That's very helpful. And that was my question. Thank you so much. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks Ashar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. I have only one question. So when I look at the plans covered by the PPA, say, in 2016, can you tell us if the assets the plans have a positive EPS contribution without the PPA? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Angie, this is Donny. Let me make sure I understand your question. So you're asking if Sammis and Davis-Besse have a positive earnings contribution without the PPA? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. So basically, when you showed us the EBITDA and then a bridge to net income or EPS, for SES \u2013 or CES without the PPAs, can you tell us the assets of those three plans or two plans that are covered by PPAs, so without the PPA would they have a positive EPS impact? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Yes. For 2016, Sammis and Davis-Besse would definitely both have positive earnings per share impact. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: How about 2017 or 2018 based on the current forwards on capacity payments? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: I don't think we're giving any guidance on forward years, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Because I mean, we are all struggling I think with the impact of your PPAs on your bottom line because we just don't know what's the offset from the current earnings power of these assets. That's why I am asking? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I understand you are struggling with it, and I understand that the estimates are all over the board for what this ESP means. And believe me, as soon as we can give you clarification, we plan to do that. Once we have an answer from FERC, we will tell you what the value of this company is going forward with the ESP. If we don't have an answer, then we're going to give you 2016 guidance without the ESP. And I apologize that we're leaving you hanging out there, but it's just too big a moving part for us to speculate on the outcome. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. I understand. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Just \u2013 most of my questions have been answered. Just want to follow-up as the company is looking to transition more to a regulated utility, thoughts on maybe rate basing or getting some type of cost of severance return on Pleasants, on other power plants, particularly Pleasants or Mansfield? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first of all, we are a regulated utility. 90%-plus of our earnings today come from our regulated operations. What we're talking about is growth and investment inside that regulated utility. We filed our integrated resource plan with West Virginia. I think later this year, they'll start taking a look at it seriously, and it's up to the West Virginia Commission to decide would Pleasants be the appropriate solution. Obviously, we have a model in place already with Harrison, and we think that is something they ought to look at. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : In Pennsylvania, is there a similar filing or similar thought process, or just West Virginia? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just West Virginia. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Real quick, do you ever put or can you discuss what you think the scale of the MAIT investment could be over a multi-year time? I mean, should we think about it similar to the size and scale of what ATSI and TrAIL have been? Now, I know lots of TrAIL was just one big project, but ATSI was a series of projects. Is it something that could be significantly smaller or significantly bigger? Just trying to get arms around how you're \u2013 I don't know how you are thinking about the size, scale and scope of MAIT could be? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, first of all, let me clarify again. We've told you we have over $15 billion of Transmission projects that our teams already identified on our existing 24,000 miles of Transmission System. Those projects can be executed with or without MAIT. MAIT is a vehicle to improve the recovery mechanism from a transparency perspective for investors and lower the cost of capital to make those investments more efficient for customers. That's all MAIT is. It doesn't stop us from moving forward with the transmission investment program. As far as the scale of the program, we'll talk to you about that once we know the base of the company that we're operating on after we get a resolution on this ESP, because it's more driven by our capability of raising the cash and likely some equity to fund it. So we'll tell you about that once we know those answers. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around MAIT. The transmission in the Eastern part of your service territories seems like a huge opportunity in terms of the rate base growth there. And just trying to get my arms around kind of the magnitude of the impact over time. One other question for you. O&M, where do you see the greatest opportunities across your businesses to manage O&M further down and you've done a really good job over the last year or so in doing so. Where do you see the incremental opportunities and where potentially are their headwinds? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I don't think of it necessarily as managing O&M down. I think about it as spending the appropriate amount of O&M to serve our customers the right way. And as we invest in new equipment, O&M is going to trend down. In the Transmission System, we're replacing 60-year and 70-year old equipment with brand new equipment, that as I've shared before we're basically buying with 30-year warranties from the manufacturer \u2013 full warranties where we don't have to do any O&M on them. So we're going to spend the appropriate O&M as long as we're having rate cases and we're having timely recovery of our expenses, I think the shareholders are immune to how much O&M is involved. And so when you think about it, it's more about where do we spend it, how is it being recovered and is this the right amount for customers. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks Chuck. Much appreciated. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Take care Michael. Operator : Thank you. We're showing time for one additional question today. Our last question will be coming from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, Thank you. Most of... Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): ...my questions have been answered. Just quickly on strategic direction in M&A, I guess if the Ohio PPA goes one way or the other, does that change your view around how you think about M&A in general? There's clearly a lot of M&A that happened last year, it continues to be top of M&A this year. So, if you could just broadly \u2013 now that you're going more towards the regulated platform and clearly as you said, you are a regulated utility, how are you thinking about strategic direction in M&A in that context? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Of all the things I've been thinking about a CEO the last 16 months, M&A is not high on that priority. That's how I would answer that. We're trying to strengthen the company that we know. We're a big company; we have 6 million customers to serve. We're going to do that the right way. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Before we leave, I have one final announcement that I'd like to make. Many of you know Rey Jimenez, Rey has been part of our IR team at FirstEnergy since 1997, and he has decided that he would rather spend his time in retirement than talking to all of you in the future. So, he is going to be retiring after 39 years with the company. He will be in the office until early June and I'd encourage you \u2013 I know many of you have worked with him, to get a chance to wish him the best as we will for a healthy and happy retirement. So, just wanted to make that announcement. Thank you all again for your support and confidence, and we'll be talking to you again as soon as we have an answer from FERC. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

At this time all, participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Geiger Beringer - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on the website. Please note that we have also provided a slide presentation that will follow this morning's discussions. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Since our call in April, we have continued to take aggressive steps to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit our customers, employees and shareholders. We're making steady progress on our strategic initiatives in our regulated businesses and we've had to make difficult, but necessary decisions to address the effects of challenging market dynamics on our Competitive business. Today, Jim and I will discuss these developments, our second quarter earnings and the 2016 guidance that we published last night. We have a full agenda and we want to ensure there's plenty of time for your questions at the end of the call, so let's get started. Yesterday afternoon, we reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share, primarily reflecting asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share at our Competitive business segment, which I will discuss in a moment. On an operating earnings basis, our results for the second quarter were a solid $0.56 per share, which is in line with our expectations. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results. Looking at the full year, as you know, we had hoped to provide 2016 guidance that would include the final impact of our regulatory outcome in Ohio. However, given the Ohio procedural schedule, we decided to provide guidance now that excludes any potential impact of that case. This is consistent with our desire for transparent communications and also provides our employees with clear financial goals for the remainder of the year. On a GAAP basis, we expect a loss for the full year of 2016 in the range of negative $0.75 to negative $0.55 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which includes up to $500 million in additional equity this year. This range is in line with current consensus estimates that exclude any impact from Ohio. Again, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP primarily reflects the second quarter charges at our Competitive business. Jim will provide more details on our 2016 expectations for each business segment, including adjusted EBITDA for our Competitive business. In our Ohio EPS IV case, we expect to complete hearings next week. The remaining schedule is expected to provide for a potential final order from the PUCO in the September or October timeframe. The hearing is focused on the modified Rider RRS proposal that we filed in May, as well as the PUCO staff testimony, which proposed a Distribution Modernization Rider. Neither of these alternatives include a purchase power agreement tied to Davis-Besse, Sammis or any other plant in our fleet. Moving to other regulatory matters, you'll recall that in April we filed new rate request for our four utilities in Pennsylvania and for JCP&L in New Jersey. We received a procedural schedule for the Pennsylvania case with hearing starting on September 6. As always, we look forward to beginning settlement discussions on the Pennsylvania cases. In New Jersey, our rate request has moved to the Office of Administrative Law and we are awaiting the procedural schedule. In our Transmission business, we continue to make progress on our Energizing the Future initiatives and we were pleased last week to receive Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval to move our Met-Ed and Penelec Transmission assets into our new affiliate company Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This new standalone transmission subsidiary is structured to help facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. In New Jersey, we are also making progress to bring certain JCP&L assets into that subsidiary. A procedural schedule was recently issued with hearings beginning in late October or early November. Finally, we continue to review the competitiveness of our generation fleet in light of week power prices, the low capacity auction outcome in May, and an anemic demand forecast. As you know, last Friday we announced our intent to either sell or deactivate the 136-megawatt Bay Shore plant by October of 2020 and to deactivate Units 1 through 4 of the Sammis plant in May of 2020. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $640 million, as well as coal contract termination and settlement costs of $58 million associated with retired and deactivated units. In addition, based on the low results of the most recent PJM capacity auction for the 2019, 2020 planning year, as well as our updated long-term fundamental pricing model, we recognized an $800 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge, which represents the total amount of goodwill at our Competitive segments. We also recognized valuation allowances of $159 million against state and local NOLs or net operating loss carry-forwards, given our current projections and statutory limitations on the utilization of NOLs at the state and local level. No valuation allowances were necessary for our federal NOLs. Our country has completed the deactivation of more than 40,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity in the last six years with about 40 plants scheduled to close this year alone. Since last fall, the industry has announced the planned retirement of 7 U.S. nuclear stations, totaling nearly 8,000 megawatt of generating capacity, with most of these units closing within the next three years. We believe it is critical for our country to maintain baseload generation, especially zero-emission nuclear and even coal, which we believe offers greater fuel security than natural gas. And we plan to continue to advocate for competitive reforms that ensure wholesale markets to adequately value existing baseload generation. At this time, however, we do not see any short-term solutions to the current challenging market situation. Longer-term, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and are focused regulated operations. And we cannot put investors and our company at risk as we wait for the country and PJM to address the issues with the current construct. We will continue to seek opportunities both within the competitive realm and the states to further de-risk the business and convert megawatts from competitive markets to a regulated or regulated-like construct. In particular, we will monitor legislative efforts to maintain important baseload generation in various states, including Ohio and New York. We also plan to work with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when they are ready to address the generation shortfall included in Mon Power's integrated resource plan. I continue to believe that those companies that own generation, transmission, and distribution in a vertically-integrated or other type of fully-regulated model are best situated to provide reliable and affordable service to customers now and in the future. And one of our goals has been to keep as much of our current generation fleet viable. But given the market conditions, we will look at all alternatives that are constructed from a balance sheet and cash perspective, including the possible sale or deactivation of additional units. As I've stated many times, FirstEnergy's earnings are now more than 80% regulated and our long-term goal is to operate as a fully-regulated utility company. We continue to expect our Competitive segment to be cash flow positive each year through 2018 and our generation team continues to look for cost savings given the current environment. They have already identified an additional $80 million of fossil fleet cost reductions each year in 2017 and 2018, beyond those identified as part of last year's cash flow improvement project. These savings will help offset the further erosion in power prices. In addition, we plan to delay the Beaver Valley unit two steam generator replacement from 2020 to 2023, given the solid condition of the existing steam generator. Our Competitive business will continue to invest in its nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations and improve overall performance. At the fossil fleet, market conditions will influence our capital investments, with current conditions favoring limited investments. We do not intend to infuse additional equity into our Competitive business in order to support credit ratings. As you know, following our announcement of the asset impairments and plant exit costs last Friday, S&P put FirstEnergy Solutions, Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company on credit watch. We held constructive meetings with both S&P and Moody's earlier this week. We expect both agencies to review our competitive entities at committee meetings in the near future, which may result in non-investment grade credit ratings for those entities. This could result in potential collateral calls of up to $300 million. However, our available liquidity of about $3 billion would be more than adequate to cover such calls. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade ratings at all of our regulated businesses and to improving FirstEnergy Corp.'s metrics in line with our earlier disclosures. And we remain firmly focused on positioning our company for success through a customer-focused strategy that is designed to provide continuous service reliability and timely recovery of our investments. We believe the actions we have outlined today will build a stronger FirstEnergy for our employees, customers and investors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. As Chuck mentioned, asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share drove our second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share. Chuck also indicated that our pre-tax impairment charge for the closure or deactivation of Units 1 through 4 at Sammis and the Bay Shore plant were $640 million. That number is actually $647 million. A full listing of the special items can be found on page one of the consolidated report. On an operating earnings basis, our results were $0.56 per share, a solid second quarter and in line with our expectations across all three segments. Earnings in our Distribution business decreased as a result of higher retirement benefit costs and lower distribution deliveries, associated with a decline in average customer usage. These factors were partially offset by the effect of rate increases in Pennsylvania that were implemented in May 2015. Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2015, with a 1.5% decrease in residential sales and less than a 1% decrease in commercial sales. Weather-related usage was essentially flat compared to last year. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.7%, similar to last quarter. Continued growth in the shale gas sector was more than offset by lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. However, this quarter also reflects a number of temporary shutdowns from industrial customers that should come back online later this year, based on our discussions with several large customers. In our Transmission business, earnings decreased due to ATSI and TrAIL's annual true up to their formula rates, reflecting an adjustment to true-up revenue based on estimated recoverable cost to actual cost, a lower ROE at ATSI that went into effect this past January, and lower capitalized financing costs. These factors were partially offset by higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. In our Competitive business, solid second quarter operating earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position, higher capacity revenues, driven by increased capacity prices, lower transmission charges and lower fossil fuel expense. Contract sales volume decreased consistent with our hedging strategy. Let's now move on to some details surrounding our 2016 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This reflects six months of actual results and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, although, July has been quite warm across most of our service territory. First, we'd like to point out that consensus estimates have a very wide range in 2016 of more than $0.50. Several analysts still include the benefit of a PPA, along with varying amounts of equity. When you adjust for these disparities, our 2016 operating earnings guidance is in line with consensus. At the regulated utility business, we're expecting 2016 operating earnings of $1.74 to $1.82 per share, with a mid-point of $1.78, which is slightly higher than 2015 weather-normalized operating earnings of $1.76 per share. We expect share dilution of $0.04 at the distribution segment related to approximately $600 million of total equity this year, including about $100 million in our annual program related to employee benefits and our stock investment program. Ongoing expenses such as pension, OPEB, depreciation and taxes and the full-year impact of the New Jersey rate case resolved last year, are offset by the impact of Pennsylvania rates that went into effect May of 2015 and higher revenues resulting from the increase in the Ohio DCR. Residential and commercial sales are expected to decrease this year as customer growth is offset by lower use per customer, driven predominantly by the adoption of energy efficient technologies, most notably LED lighting. Likewise, the industrial sector is expected to be flat to slightly down this year as growth from the shale sector is offset by steel and related industry slowdowns. The earnings guidance materials published to our website last night include more details on our expectations for load by state and by sector. At our Transmission segment, we expect a slight up lift over 2015 due to the favorable impact of higher revenues associated with increased rate base at ATSI, up $2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in 2015. This is partially offset by ATSI's lower return on equity of 10.38% compared to 12.38% in the first half and 11.06% in the second half of 2015. In the Competitive business, we have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 64 million megawatt hours of committed sales. 8 million megawatt hours will remain open to market prices for the remainder of the year. Our 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the Competitive business is $850 million to $950 million. Positive drivers include one less nuclear outage and the benefit of the cash flow improvement program. Lower capacity revenues associated with lower auction clearing prices beginning in June 2016 will reduce commodity margin year-over-year, and increase pension costs and depreciation due to a higher asset base are the main negative drivers. At Corporate, an increase in the effective tax rate to 38% in 2016 compared to 36% in 2015 combined with higher interest expense from higher rates on the FirstEnergy revolver and term loan are the primary drivers. Finally, we remain focused on efforts that complement FirstEnergy Corp's balance sheet so that we can continue our Energizing the Future transmission program, which is in its third year with nearly $3 billion spent so far. After we have an order in Ohio, we hope to be in a position to provide an update on our business outlook at EEI that would include capital plans for our Energizing the Future program, as well as our distribution and generation businesses. We also hope to be in a position to provide 2017 guidance and our financing plan. As Chuck said, we had a productive and solid first half, and we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Now I'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Shah Pourreza of Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, Chuck and Jim. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, clearly somewhat of a change in strategy around the merchant business and obviously you could tell from your tone that frustration has gone to a peak level here. When \u2013 I guess the first question is around the assets. Is there other assets you can sort of highlight that could be potentially rationalized? And then is there a point in time where you sort of capitulate with this business, either move it to non-core or even discontinued operations at this point? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first, I don't think there's been any change in strategy. I think since last January, we've been talking about FirstEnergy's focus on regulated operations, and I have talked about that Competitive business as \u2013 obviously we own a merchants generation business. We've been trying to situate it to run it more utility-like, if you will, and I think that's paying off this year. We had a very hot period in June and while we're not here today to talk about third quarter results, very hot July and the strategy where we're keeping some reserve margin in that generation to protect us against rising loads is working. I think we're running it very reliably and we're making it such that it's a fairly predictable business for us, even in the market that it's in. Unfortunately, the predictability is such that it's going to continue to decline in terms of the contribution it makes to the company as a whole, both in the capacity market and in the energy market. And is it frustrating that we're shutting down tens of thousands of megawatts of generation in our country that's got life left in it because of the way this market is working and that we're ignoring the fact that we have to build more transmission in order to allow the grid to work the right way when we replace it with natural gas generation that is what I call being built as energy conversion factories, not being built to serve customers, that is very frustrating to me. But nonetheless, I think we are doing the things we need to do as a company to make FirstEnergy strong even with the current merchant business that we have today. I said in my remarks that we will look at every option that's available to us that is positive from a cash and credit perspective to move out of that business over time, and that's our goal, and that's kind of always been where we've been at. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the option side, I know AEP certainly talked a lot about restructuring legislation that they're going to be going after not reregulation but restructuring. And they did highlight that they're engaged stakeholders. So curious, is this sort of something that you're joining AEP with? Are you one of the stakeholders? Just some color there would be good. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, right now I think we've got a bigger issue in Ohio we're working on and I think it's important that we keep our regulatory and legislative and legal teams focused on that issue, and that's what we're going to do. I'm aware of what AEP is proposing. I think it's a very creative approach. I think it helps solve some of the issues that we have with making sure we have reliable capacity going forward in the right places without having to build transmission on top of it, and I'm pulling for them. At the right time, we may join in with them in that effort, but at this point in time we're not actively involved in it. We're trying to get our ESP case done. Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it, got it. And then just lastly, that's helpful, when you think about sort of your forward equity needs, not to right-size the balance sheet as a result of whatever happens with Ohio, but more from a growth perspective, should we just, going forward beyond 2016, assume 50%-50% cap structure on your transmission initiatives? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : From our side, we'll look at probably capitalizing the Transmission segments, where the rates are set at a 60% equity level. Initially MAIT, we will have it at a 50%-50% cap structure. Now, obviously at the holdco level of transmission, we will have a cap structure that's a little higher than that on the debt side. But that's how I would think about it going forward. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Excellent. Thanks Jim and Chuck. Operator : Our next question Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good Morning. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Good Morning, Neel. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I just wanted to understand the \u2013 how you're looking at the investment-grade metrics for the company. Are we to think that \u2013 you're obviously going to keep the utilities investment grade. It seems like you're willing to let the merchant business go to sub-investment grade, but what about the holdco or the parent? Do you plan to keep that investment-grade alongside the utilities? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely and I said that in my prepared remarks. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then when we look to the merchant business, is it still free cash flow positive in the outer years with the latest capacity price print and just where the forwards are right now? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's cash flow positive through 2018 and we haven't talked to you about beyond that. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And if you were to require more capital just for the plants with CapEx, would a sub-investment-grade entity be able to access more capital? And would you look to access capital from the markets to fund the GenCo markets if it was needed? Or would you continue to find ways to basically rationalize the fleet? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Jim answer the question in detail, but I think we're confident we can raise whatever we need in order to keep that business going in terms of refinancing existing obligations. I do not see us leveraging that business more in order to keep it going. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yes, this is Jim, Neel. I'd agree with Chuck. As we said, that business is expected to be cash flow positive each year through 2018. We're coming through the end of our construction phase. We'll be done with most of our match expenditures. Mansfield dewatering facility will be completed. And as we said, we are going to move the refueling \u2013 or I mean, the Beaver Valley-2 steam generator and head replacement out to 2023. In addition, we have a $1.5 billion credit facility at the competitive side that we have not used. So I don't think funding that business will be any issue. However, we are going to be very focused on the capital investments and we don't intend to make any investments, especially on the fossil slide, unless it's for safety or to preserve our options going forward. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And one last quick question. We're going to get hopefully the Ohio decision wrapped up in September and is the plan to kind of release the longer-term capital needs plan at EEI or is there an Analyst Day separate from that where you plan to do that? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would say this. We are committed to telling you what this company looks like once we have the Ohio case done. If the timing works out for us to do that at EEI, then we'll do it at EEI. If the timing doesn't work out for that, then we'll have a meeting that's specifically designed around telling you the outcome and what it does to our company, whether it's an Analyst Meeting or how we do that, but yes, we're going to communicate that to you as transparently as we can. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Meghan Geiger Beringer - Director- Investor Relations : Before we move on to the next question could I ask that all of the analysts limit their questions to just one. We have a lot of people in the queue and I'd like for us to be able to get through to everyone today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys. So, just can I ask about the strategy on holding investment-grade of the parent, and you obviously have just reiterated that's a priority, and how we should view the $500 million of equity you're doing in 2016 in that context? And let's just say if you don't get some help, what you're looking for from Ohio, can you help us think about what that scenario looks like? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I don't think you should think about the $500 million. I mean we told you we're going to issue $500 million of additional equity this year. Jim mentioned, we've already invested over $3 billion in transmission growth capital with another billion planned next year. You all look at those numbers the same as we do. I'm not going to speculate on an outcome in Ohio right now. When we know that outcome, we will know what the impact it has on our credit ratings and then we'll do what we need to do. We've got a number of other strategic options that we can execute that we will, but I think it's premature to talk about what all of those could or could not be until we see where we land in Ohio. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Julien. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So I want to just clarify the necessary metrics you need to get to. What do the agencies tell you in terms of the 14% FFO to debt versus the 11% at Moody's and perhaps 12% at S&P? So just curious, to what extent does the current equity plan get you to something that keeps you investment grade? And also perhaps a further nuance to the follow-up I'll just ask now, is S&P potentially enabling a two notch difference between your holding company and your opcos? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first of all, when we met them earlier this week, they told us, you guys all talk to them a whole lot more than we do. So I think it's pretty obvious out there what they expect us to get to. And in terms of how we're going to get there, I just said the Ohio ESP is a big piece of the puzzle that we have to get answered before we can talk about what the next steps of the puzzle are. I think it's likely that both of the agencies are going to publicly say what their expectations are here in the near future both for the Competitive business and for the rest of this company. But we're focused on keeping our investment-grade credit ratings at the holding company and for every one of our regulated entities. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : But said differently, just to be very clear about it, in terms of the metrics that you're targeting, are you and the agencies talking about a shift in the business risk profile? And are they ready to buy into that sort of in the near term, if you will? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Julien. This is Jim. I would think that the expectation is that we'd need to achieve a FFO at 14% at this point. And they would not be looking to change that in the near-term. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. And that's probably an eventual target? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : As Chuck said, we ultimately intend to be a fully-regulated company. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : But you can hit that FFO with the \u2013 depending what comes out of Ohio in this $600 million in equity? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. We can. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : We've got to wait and see what comes out of Ohio, as Chuck said. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. How are you? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just \u2013 on the credit rating, I mean, normally when I think of credit rating, I think of the senior unsecured credit rating as what sort of the focus counterparties have and what have you. And clearly, that's not what you guys are focused on, given that we already are at below investment-grade at the senior unsecured. Is there any concern about the senior unsecured? Or is it simply focused at the issuer level? And why the focus at the issuer level as opposed to senior unsecured, which is what I normally think of as being the metric that people are \u2013 that the rating that people are actually \u2013 the counterparties are focused on? Do you follow me? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we follow you. From our standpoint, we're not expecting that we're going to issue any more senior unsecured debt. So, I think the way we're looking at it, Paul, is we want to at least maintain where we're at right now. And our goal would be at the S&P level to get the corporate credit rating ultimately notched up one. That would also notch up our senior unsecured. From a Moody's standpoint, we are already at investment grade. So that's the way we're thinking about it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. And I guess that's my question. I realize you guys are time limited. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. I realize you're in a case in Ohio. The \u2013 can you talk about sort of the implications if the outcome ends up being something along the lines of the staff recommendations and how you would view that? Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we just filed our rebuttal testimony and attempted to point out what we thought some of the potential things that the staff missed in their testimony might be. I think some of those are pretty obvious. And even the commission staff in their testimony agreed that there were adjustments that were made or need to be made to the initial number they came out with. So I'm going to answer this question the way I've always answered. I'm not going to speculate about things that we don't know about. So we've got another couple of months to get through this case in Ohio. We've been waiting patiently for two years and three months to get to an outcome here. And with only a couple of months left, I'm not going to start guessing at what the outcome is. We're going to get the outcome. We're going to deal with that outcome, and then we're going to move forward and we're going to move forward in a way where we expect to maintain investment-grade credit for our holding company and all of our regulated entities. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Sorry to repeat the question. But Jim, that 14% target, is that the Moody's target or is that the S&P target or is that both? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : The 14%, that's the threshold that Moody's has designed. From our standpoint, we're targeting at 14.5% to 15% of FFO. But the 14% is Moody's. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. And you're also expecting rate relief in Pennsylvania and New Jersey along with hopefully a constructive outcome in Ohio. So as we think about cash flows going into 2017 and beyond in the regulated businesses, you're making assumptions with regard to the improvement in cash flow from all three of those things, right... James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : That's correct, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...the equity issuance to get you to that number? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yes, that would get us above the threshold that they've set. But again, our target is 14.5% to 15%. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. And that does not presume any further equity needs post 2016? Or that's sort of an iterative question relative to the total amount of rate relief you receive? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : I think it's an iterative question. We'll continue to do the employee benefit program and stock investment program. But as Chuck said earlier, I think there's a big piece of the puzzle that still has to fall into place before we have any further consideration there. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. One last quick thing, the $500 million you're going to issue, is that going to be issued into the pension plan or would that be issued directly to the public? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : As we said, this $500 million that we expect to issue, we expect to contribute that equity to our qualified pension plan. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, Chuck and Jim. I don't think you covered this earlier. Maybe you could give us color on the units that were shut at Bay Shore and Sammis or are targeted to be shut and kind of where they're running right now on a kind of earnings contribution and cash flow contribution basis. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : The units that we shut down or said that we were going to deactivate by 2020 was just Unit 1 at Bay Shore, the only unit we have, and it was Sammis 1 through 4 at Sammis. We've never disclosed what those would be from an earnings standpoint. But when you look at the total, including the capital that we would have to invest and the revenues net of their operating expenses, it will make us improve our cash flow going forward. And that's essentially the reason we decided to deactivate those units. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. That's all I had. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Most of my questions have been answered, but what's the timing on the equity and have you baked July weather into your guidance? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : We have not baked July weather into the guidance. As I said in my comments on the script though, July was a very warm month and our plants ran very well. So, I would expect that we will have some weather improvement in July. As far as the equity, we really can't comment on the timing of the equity transaction. However, I can tell you our earnings guidance is conservative and assumes dilution starts in the earlier part of the second half of 2016. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And we've planned normal weather for the rest of the half \u2013 the second half of the year in our guidance numbers. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the 2016 guidance. Could you give us a sense, either specific or more high level, how you're doing against your kind of allowed ROEs in your key jurisdictions within the guidance in 2016? Are you kind of earning in line, are you under-earning a decent amount? Any help from that standpoint. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Steve, this is Jim. From my standpoint, I would say in all of our jurisdictions, we will be earning right in line with the authorized ROEs. And as you know, a few of the jurisdictions, they have what's called black-box settlement, where they don't come out and particularly say exactly where it is. But with the filing we have in New Jersey, the four utilities in Pennsylvania, where we are in Ohio that essentially covers all of our utilities with the exception of Maryland and West Virginia. And we just had the filing in West Virginia a little over a year ago. And Maryland, we're seeing some load growth there. So, I would say we're earning right in line with all of our ROEs. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, I'm sorry, I just want to clarify though because I was asking more specific to 2016, since we now have a base figure providing us for 2016. Since you're not getting the rate relief really by then in 2016, are you under earning a little bit, and then when you get the rate relief, you earn more in line? Are you \u2013 is the rate relief mainly for growth, so you're kind of earning in line? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : If you look in New Jersey, the rate relief is associated with our capital investments we've made since mid-2012. We've had about $600 million and some of investment there. So we're not earning on that capital right now. So, I would say we're probably slightly under earning there. In 2016, we would expect that we would have a decision in Pennsylvania by January 27. So our guidance would include earnings that would get us pretty near to what our ROE expectations are. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Hi, guys. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. My quick question on the generation business, is there any intention to ring-fence that business, to protect the ratings of the holding company and the utility from what happens at the generation side? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Praful, this is Jim. I would say, we're not looking at any type of new legal actions or anything to ring-fence that side of the house. The way you should look at it is, there's no cross defaults on any of the financings that we have out there or the credit facilities. FirstEnergy Corp. does guarantee about $1.25 billion on that side of the house. And it's really made up of about $1.2 billion of our underfunded pension, OPEB and EDCP cost. And then there's just about $50 million associated with some contracts that FES has. So, from my standpoint, there's no thought about ring-fencing. But that's just where we are with that side of the house. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. So just to clarify, if there is a strategic action like a sale or something further down the road, where not all the debt is covered, are you looking to \u2013 my question is are you going to support the debt or are you going to walk away from it from a holding company perspective? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Well, I don't think that's something that we've been contemplating at this point. The business is still cash flow positive. We intend to make every effort to ensure that those assets continue to run. As Chuck said earlier, if we get to a point, we may look to deactivate or sell some assets. But I think that question is much further down the road. I was just speaking to what the guarantees are by the holding company. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Just real quickly on the non-regulated side, your volume expectations. You all used to talk about volume of between about 80 million and 85 million, most from your generation, but also a little bit of purchased power. When I look at the guidance slides, it looks like it's a good bit light of that for 2016. Can you just \u2013 am I seeing that right? And can you just talk about what's going on a little bit? Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.: Yes, Michael, this is Donny. Yes, we have pulled back a little bit. With where we're at with Sammis 1 through 4, we expect very little production out of those machines going forward. They'll still be available, but we see very little production coming out. So we've reduced kind of what we'll produce in the range of 70 terawatt hours to 75 terawatt hours. And that's very dependent on what the forward market does. And then we have about 5 terawatt hours that we purchased through wind contracts, OVEC, that sort of thing. So we'll produce about 75 terawatt hours to 80 terawatt hours going forward. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, okay. I don't know if Irene will let me, but I'm going to try and sneak in a follow-up on West Virginia. Can you just talk about the time line for wind West Virginia, when Mon Power needs new capacity and some of the alternatives, whether it's building or buying combined cycle versus buying or transferring an existing coal unit? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Good morning. This is Leila. So we previously filed the IRP. It showed a need for generation going out a couple of years from now. But that case right now is concluded. So there is nothing that would, unless we were to file something, initiate something, that would come out of that case. So we would be looking as we go forward and continue to monitor the forecast for that company to see how we might want to present something consistent with the IRP in terms of bringing additional generation to Mon Power. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So there's no formal like RFP process that's about to kick off or that will be undertaken in 2016 or 2017? Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer : Correct. There's no time line associated with that. We would initiate it when we believe it to be the appropriate time. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. Just one question for Jim. The effective tax rate increase, 38% from 36%, can you give more color on that? And if my math is right, that's more than about \u2013 more than half of the $0.08 differential between 2016 and 2015 that you show on slide nine. K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller: Yes, this is Jon. Most of the increase, we had some benefits that flowed through in the second half of 2015 that reduced the tax rate down to 36% and we don't expect that going forward. So, I would think that 38% would be a more normalized tax rate. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thanks. And then was my math right that, that's a big chunk of that $0.08? K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller: That's right. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : That is. K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller: That's right. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thanks. That's all I had. Operator : Our next question comes in the line ever Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just to jump on the previous question, 2016 guidance holdco losses at $0.52, is that something I could carry forward post 2016 and where that \u2013 in that realm? I know you're not giving post guidance, but around $0.50 of holdco losses? James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I would say that's a representative number. As you know, we have about $6 billion of debt at the holding company. Some of that is what I'd say variable rate debt. So, if you make an assumption that interest rates are going up, then you could see a change to that. But the biggest component is interest expense and about several billion is subject to variable interest rates. So, you could see a change in that if we had an upward movement in interest rates. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raymond Leung of RBC Capital markets. Please proceed with your question. Raymond Leung - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, Chuck. Hey, Jim. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ray. Raymond Leung - RBC Capital Markets LLC : A couple of questions. One, could you talk a little bit about the strategy of how do you bridge the gap to hit your credit metrics if you don't get a favorable ruling out of Ohio? And then could you also give us an update where you are maybe with Fitch? I think you guys were potentially looking at exploring a rating with them? And the last thing, any limitations aside from that guarantee from legally separating FES via some sort of a sale? Thanks. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll take \u2013 there were three questions in there. So, take the first one and that is, I've already answered it a couple of times here. We're not going to speculate about Ohio. There's a whole wide range of outcomes. The staff said one point. The corrections we made to the staff testimony got that number up in the over $500 million. I think we've got to let that process play out, see where we're at, and then we will take whatever steps we deem are appropriate to maintain our investment-grade credit for our holding company and our utilities. And those steps are so wide-ranging depending on the outcome for Ohio, it's just \u2013 I don't think it's good to speculate about them, so I'm not going to talk about them. I'll tell you what we know when we know it. On the second question, Jim \u2013 I think Jim already answered it. We're not looking at doing anything to legally ring-fence our generation business. But as I said, we're not going to use any equity to support the credit ratings of that business. We're operating it in a fashion that's cash flow positive. And we're going to make whatever decisions that we need to make on a unit-by-unit basis to deactivate them, sell them in order to keep that business as positive of a member of the FirstEnergy team as we can. James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : And Ray, this is Jim. I'll take your final, the third question. Yes, Irene and her team, they continue to have discussions with Fitch about potentially reinstating the ratings. So I think we're having very good dialogue with them and we should be in a position to update you probably later this year. Raymond Leung - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Much appreciated. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So there aren't any more questions on the board and we're running towards the end of our hour. So thank you all again. I know we had to make some very difficult decisions last week. Look forward to talking to you more about that part of our business when we see you all at EEI. And just thanks for all the support that you've given us. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Crowdell - Jefferies LLC Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp.'s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on the website. Please note that we have also provided a slide presentation that will follow this morning's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; Brian Farley, Vice President of Sales for the Competitive business; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year. During our call today, Jim and I will review our financial results and key strategic developments while leaving ample time for your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share, while operating earnings were $0.90 per share. These results beat the top of our third quarter operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 due to the favorable impact of record summer temperatures as well as strong operational results across all three of our business segments. For the full year, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss range of $1.30 to $0.90 per share, which primarily reflects the impairments we took in the second quarter, along with this quarter's estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we are raising and narrowing our 2016 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, reflecting the strong third quarter results. In addition to these results, we made solid progress on our regulatory initiatives, including reaching a positive settlement with the parties in our Pennsylvania rate cases. The settlements, which have been filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allow for incremental revenue of approximately $291 million across our four utilities. The terms of the settlement will provide us with the necessary resources and technology to continue improving our infrastructure and help ensure continued safe and reliable electric service for our 2 million utility customers in Pennsylvania. We expect the Public Utilities Commission to issue its final orders on the settlements before January 26, 2017, and the new rates are expected to take effect on January 27. Turning to New Jersey, we are very pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement in principle with the parties in our rate case, including Rate Counsel and the BPU staff, that would provide an $80 million annual revenue increase beginning January 1. The terms of the agreement must still be finalized, filed and approved by the BPU. JCP&L remains committed to providing customers with strong reliability with some of the lowest rates in the state. And in Ohio, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission authorized a distribution modernization rider that will allow our Ohio utilities to collect $204 million per year, including the gross up for taxes, through 2019, with a possible two-year extension. Moving to our Transmission business. Last week, both our new MAIT subsidiary and JCP&L filed forward-looking formula rates with FERC. These rates will replace stated rates that had been in place since 1998 at JCP&L, Penelec and Met-Ed. The filings will support 2017 transmission investments of more than $170 million in New Jersey and more than $260 million in our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas. In both cases, we have requested the new rates to take effect on January 1, 2017. On balance, it was a terrific quarter, and Jim will provide much more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. I'm going to devote the rest of my time to discussing the topic I think you really want to hear about, our strategic plans for our Competitive Generation business. As we said on our last earnings call, we do not believe Competitive Generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our regulated growth strategy. But one of my goals since becoming CEO has been to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. We believe that a vertically integrated or regulated-light construct is the best way to provide reliable and affordable electric service to customers, both now and in the future. And, of course, preserving these units would also benefit our communities and the employees who have dedicated their careers to keeping the units operating safely and efficiently. We have worked for meaningful market reforms and our team has had tremendous success reducing the cost structure of our Generation business. While we have delayed investments where possible at our fossil fleet, we remain committed to making all appropriate investments in our nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations, and we will not compromise our obligations to the industry, our communities and employees to operate our nuclear fleet with excellence. But competitive market conditions continue to deteriorate, punctuated by weak power prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts. The fact is Competitive Generation is weighing down the rest of our company. And while we have fought hard, we cannot continue to wait for an upturn. Instead, a strategic review of our Competitive business is underway and we are pursuing options to thoughtfully, yet expeditiously, move away from Competitive markets. We will be assessing several different alternatives in the near term, with a goal to implement these strategic options over the next 12 to 18 months. First, after the election is over next week, we plan to begin legislative and regulatory efforts designed to preserve our remaining generation assets. We are looking to convert Competitive Generation to a regulated or regulated-light construct in Ohio, while seeking a solution for nuclear units in Ohio and Pennsylvania that recognizes the environmental benefits of these established baseload-generating resources. And in West Virginia, Mon Power plans to issue an RFP to address its generation shortfall by the end of this year. We expect that Allegheny Energy Supply would likely offer the Pleasants plant into that process. We will work diligently with legislators and regulators in each of these states to assess the appetite for solutions that can benefit customers and communities, but not at the expense of extending our transition to becoming fully regulated. We're also open to exploring the sale of any or all of these assets, particularly the gas and hydro units at Allegheny Energy Supply. If we find that one or more of these options are not viable, we'll also consider deactivating additional competitive generating units, similar to the ones we announced this summer at Sammis Units 1 through 4 and Bay Shore. Again, we will act quickly to assess these alternatives. We believe an accelerated timeframe is necessary so that we can remove lingering uncertainty, especially for our employees, and ensure that our company is singularly focused on the transition to becoming a fully-regulated company. As we aggressively pursue these options, we will continue to operate our Competitive segment to remain free cash flow positive each year, in both 2017 and 2018, and we do not intend to provide equity contributions to the business from FirstEnergy Corporation. We met last week with all three of the rating agencies to outline our transition to becoming a fully regulated utility, and we expect to see announcements from them shortly. Further downgrades of FirstEnergy Solutions by the rating agencies could require posting additional collateral of $355 million, which FirstEnergy Solutions could address through a combination of cash on hand, borrowing under the unregulated money pool or proceeds from asset sales. However, the continued viability of FirstEnergy Solutions is also pressured by some additional risks over the near term. These risks, which include an inability to implement our strategic alternatives in a timely manner, an adverse outcome related to a coal transportation contract dispute at FirstEnergy Solutions, or the inability for FirstEnergy Solutions to extend or refinance debt maturities of $515 million in 2018 could cause FirstEnergy Solutions to take additional actions, including restructuring its debt and other financial obligations or seeking bankruptcy protection. We have received a number of questions about FirstEnergy Corporation obligations to the Competitive side of the business. Let me take a minute to discuss these questions. First, I want to stress that one single qualified pension plan covers all FirstEnergy employees. So the $921 million pension obligation to employees of our Competitive business would remain a FirstEnergy obligation. Further, a list of guaranteed amounts can be found in the 10-Q we are filing today. These guaranteed items total $168 million related to CES and include energy contracts, certain generation-related matters and that business' portion of deferred compensation benefits that FirstEnergy guarantees for all affiliate employee participants. Any additional exposure of FirstEnergy Corporation to our Competitive business will be considered as part of the strategic review. Also note that as we make this transition we are planning to move forward with the bringing on independent board members at FirstEnergy Solutions. Again, we are optimistic that solutions can be found during this strategic review to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. Closing plants is an extremely difficult step, both for me personally and for our company, because keeping them viable is in the best interest of our electric customers, the states, the communities where the plants are located and our employees. But we believe these actions are the right ones for our future. They are consistent with both our goal to operate as a fully regulated utility company and our goal to position the company for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. As Chuck mentioned, we reported strong GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share, and $0.90 per share on an operating earnings basis. These solid results exceeded our expectations due to the impact of record summer temperatures on our distribution business and strong generation plant performance. Third quarter cooling degree days were 28% higher than the same period in 2015 and 46% higher than normal, a record in the 38 years that we have been tracking the impact of weather. This drove a 6.9% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2015, with a 12.8% increase in residential sales and 4.7% increase in commercial sales. In the industrial sector, sales increased 2.4% in the quarter. This is the first increase in industrial deliveries since the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven by stronger demand from the shale, coal mining and steel industries, as well as the chemical and auto sectors. Over the last year and a half, we have seen a drop in steel and coal customer sales, but both have leveled off. Looking ahead, we expect industrial sales to increase, primarily due to the strong growth in the shale-related sector. We will be watching these positive developments very closely in the fourth quarter and into next year. Looking at the trends on a year-over-year basis, residential and commercial weather-normalized sales are flat and are expected to be flat in the near term. On a positive note, recent residential customer growth has been the highest since early 2007. This trend of approximately 0.5% has been seen across our footprint with the highest growth in the eastern part of our territory. Turning to our Transmission business. Third quarter earnings increased by $0.01 per share due to higher revenues in ATSI and TrAIL, which offset higher depreciation and general taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we will be reclassifying $0.07 per share from our Regulated Distribution segment to our Regulated Transmission segment related to a small portion of Transmission assets that will be recovered through the formula rates at MAIT and JCP&L. These assets were always under a Transmission rate, but were included as part of our Distribution segment. This change will impact full-year guidance for 2016 between the two segments with no impact on our consolidated earnings guidance, and it will be reflected in the 2017 earnings guidance that we will post on our website later today. In our Competitive business, our plants performed well this summer, driving results that were stronger than our internal forecasts. This partially offset the expected commodity margin decrease due to lower contract sales volume, which is consistent with our hedging strategy and lower capacity revenues, reflecting the capacity prices that went into effect in June. The commodity margin also benefited from lower capacity expense, fuel and purchased power expense and higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position. As a result of the impact of a hot summer combined with strong operational performance at our generating units, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA to the top end of our previous range at $920 million to $950 million from $850 million to $950 million. We have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 67 million megawatt hours of committed sales and 3 million megawatt hours remaining open to market prices. Finally, at corporate, lower operating expenses were more than offset by a higher consolidated effective income tax rate and higher interest expenses. As Chuck said, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss of $1.30 to $0.90 per share and raising and narrowing our 2016 operating guidance to $2.60 to $2.70 per share. And later this afternoon, we will post to our website a comprehensive packet with our EEI presentation and supplemental materials. This will include our 2016 and 2017 guidance with segment details, a five-year capital expenditure forecast for Transmission, a three-year capital expenditure forecast for our utilities and corporate, 2017 and 2018 capital and adjusted EBITDA for the Competitive businesses, long-term growth targets for our regulated business as well as our financing plan. We are making these materials available today so that you will have plenty of time to review them in advance of our meetings at the EEI Conference. Now I'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So when you talk about being on an accelerated timeframe to come to decisions with regard to the different outcomes for FES, I know you on purpose didn't give a specific timeframe because you're not sure. But do you think that you'll have wrapped up all your regulatory paths and asset sale paths at some point in 2017 and that this will be resolved during that fiscal year? Or do you think it's possible that it could take more than the next five quarters to resolve all of these decisions? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So here's what I'd say, Greg. I think we really started this transformation to a regulated company at EEI in 2013. And that launched a significant regulatory agenda that included rate proceedings in West Virginia, Ohio, twice in Pennsylvania, twice in New Jersey. Those are now all behind us. It included decisions along the way to retire assets that were uneconomic. And now we have some decisions that we have to get done in the near term. What I've said in my remarks and what I would say as an answer to your question is we expect to complete this entire process in 12 to 18 months. And in that time period, you'll be looking at a fully regulated company. There are steps along the way that I can't give you timing on the specific steps, but we're not going to let those get in the way of that goal of being fully regulated within the next 12 to 18 months. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Fantastic. Follow-up question to that. As we think about, it's obviously not going to be clear exactly where your balance sheet is going to end up in that we don't understand how many of the assets will be sold and how the cash flows at the parent are going to look, but should we presume that in your discussions with the rating agencies that they're going to articulate a goal for you in terms of where your FFO-to-debt at the parent needs to be after this transition and you'll be given a period of time to right-size your balance sheet, should you need to, to get to those metrics? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, that is their job and they've never been hesitant to do their job. So I fully expect \u2013 we met with them, as I said during the call, last week. I fully expect that later today they're going to begin talking about what their expectations are. And I'm confident that we will be able to deliver on those expectations, particularly at the holding company level. And then we have to see where this strategic decision takes us with the Competitive business over the next 12 to 18 months. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : You may not be able to answer this, but I need to ask it. When it comes to the holding company-level credit, do you think that you'll be given a period of time over which to evolve to the metrics they're going to hold you to? Or do you think that that would require a significant equity issuance in the near term? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I'd say we're going to wait and see what they say. But I can tell you this, we have positioned those metrics at the holding company pretty much where they need to be anyway over the next three years irrespective of the decisions that we're talking about today. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just wanted to \u2013 one specific thing, you mentioned the possibility of up to a bankruptcy filing of the Competitive business. Can you give us any feeling for how much \u2013 and you gave the disclosure on pension and guarantees. Is there any sense of how much operating expense that's currently allocated to Competitive might flow back to the parent in such a scenario? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Not at this time, Jonathan. We have an extensive review going on of what our company will look like when this transition is done. And as we study that and understand it better, we'll be able to talk to you about it at that time. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So that's not something that'll be apparent in disclosures later today. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I think that was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Association (sic) [Associates] (24:10). Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey. Just as of follow-up on Jonathan's question, how should we think about tax synergies in the event that FES were to be in Chapter 11 or what have you? And just how do we think about the company in the absence of this currently problematic Generation business? How do we think about things like tax synergies and what have you? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I would give you the same answer there that I just gave on some of the expenses that are shared throughout the company. We have to get into this process and understand it fully. There are going to be a whole lot of different views on how that might get handled in the event that we get to that point. But as I've said, we've got other things that we plan to execute on in the short term here before we ever get to the point where that question even has to be answered. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then in terms of, you mentioned after the election having certain meetings and what have you. Is there any point in time where there's a fish or cut bait sort of thing where a decision has to be made? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I would say this. We're committed to executing this transition to a fully regulated company within the next 12 to 18 months. That would suggest that if there's going to be any policy decisions made by these states, they're going to have to be made early in 2017 for them to be able to be impactful on that schedule. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Liou with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to talk about the rail contracts. Has anything changed on that front? I think you guys thought that there might have been environmental force majeure. So what has changed since then? It seems like you talk a little more negatively on it now. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I don't think I was talking negatively at all. I was just disclosing the fact that it's out there and a very negative impact could cause us to look at what we do with the Competitive business more quickly when it relates to a financial restructuring. But I don't feel negative about it at all. If you want, Leila can give you a little update on the timeline as to when we expect all this to happen. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: So we disclosed in our Q the liability phase of the proceeding is scheduled to commence in late November. The damages phase, if necessary, would begin in May. And then again, with the liability phase, we would expect a decision within 60 days of the end of that, which we've identified to be February 24 of 2017. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then another point that you that pointed out to was the 2018 debt maturities. Those are at the muni side, which you have a very concentrated investor base. Have you talked to any of the investors to potentially renegotiate, restructure, or even smooth out the maturity schedule? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Not at this time. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. So quickly on the new board members at the Generation side. I wanted to understand, is the thinking behind that to create more separation between Generation and the holding company with the goal that \u2013 and I guess, does it suggest that there is a risk that claims from the Generation can flow up back to the parent? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Here's what I'd say. As we started to think about what we have to accomplish over the next 12 to 18 months, it became apparent that more governance was good and more external governance is good. So we are moving forward with adding outside independent directors to the FirstEnergy Solutions board strictly for that purpose, so that we have more external governance into the process. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Gotcha. And secondly, in terms of equity issuance, you've talked about $500 million for 2016. Is there any other sense of timing in terms of if there is more needed? Is there a certain timeline we should be thinking about for additional equity? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: We have announced that we will issue $500 million of equity into our pension plan yet in 2016, and we continue to plan to do that and expect to get that done. Any further equity discussion, I'm going to put you off for now, and we'll talk to you about it at EEI. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Gotcha. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a lot of effort and hard work and success on the regulated side. A question, just rate case, I see the settlement in New Jersey. Congrats on that. Just curious, both from New Jersey and Pennsylvania, can you bridge us from the rate increases down to what may be the after-tax income impact would be? Just trying to think about things like in New Jersey, are there some higher costs that will go into service next year that might offset some of the rate case? And in Pennsylvania, are there any other things like tax or other items that could impact the after-tax contribution? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Michael. This is Jim. I would say from New Jersey, I would look at that $80 million, the pre-tax number, as flowing through the bottom line. As well, in Pennsylvania, I would expect of that $291 million, about $203 million pre-tax will fall through to the bottom line. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So there's no other incremental cost items that might offset that? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's correct. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. One other thing. Just in thinking about Transmission opportunities over the coming months or coming years, when you look at MAIT, do you see significant Transmission opportunities like you saw with ATSI and TrAIL five to seven years ago? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, absolutely. That's why we began the process to form MAIT in the first place. And I think, Michael, the amount of work that we could execute on, I think we've identified almost $20 billion worth of work that we could put in that queue. It's just a matter of we haven't communicated the speed at which we plan to execute that work plan yet. And again, I think we'll talk a little bit more about that coming up at EEI. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning. Just sort of on Michael's question, for the pre-tax impacts and the rate increase in Pennsylvania, can I just use like a normal 38% tax rate to determine net income impact? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah, you can use that, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just understand the tax implications relating to your Competitive business. Would you mind just laying out what your tax basis is? And also, I guess, really importantly, in the event of either a sale or a reorganization of the business, do you believe you can effectively use that tax loss back up to the parent perhaps to effectively allow for greater growth in the sense that you would not be a taxpayer presumably for quite some period of time? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Stephen. This is Jim. To your first question, our tax basis is about $4.3 billion there. And in fact, to Chuck's earlier comment, I think there has to be a lot more analysis done on that before we determine if we're able to utilize any of those tax benefits back at the parent if we got to that point in time. So I think it's just too premature right now. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Julien. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So I just wanted to follow up and make sure I heard you right. So you said your metrics would be able to get you there for the next few years, kind of status quo. Was that basically referring to solving for a 14% FFO-to-debt metric for the next few years? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we're there in 2017 and we're very close in 2018 and 2019. And I think we could close that gap without too much difficulty. So, yeah, I think \u2013 but here's why I'd say, Julien. The rating agencies are going to do their job and they're going to issue their reports later today or probably at the latest, Monday. So we're waiting to see what they're going to say, too. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. But you're saying without too much of a gap, you're suggesting further cost cuts, not equity, to resolve that difference? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think it's pretty clear that our Competitive business is stressed. But it's also pretty clear to me that we've taken the necessary steps to stabilize our FFO-to-debt at the holding company level. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then turning back to Pennsylvania. Sorry to hammer on this one. In terms of \u2013 what's the implied earned ROE as you think about the next few years? Just trying to reconcile the rate-based math relative to the settlement. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Julien, this is Jim. That was kind of like a black box settlement, so I don't want to get into what any implied rate of return is at this point. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Fair enough. Ultimately on a trailing basis, would you say you've continued to earn your ROE, though? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: I would say once all of the rates are in place, then we will be earning a representative ROE at all of the jurisdictions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. But even on a trailing basis prior to the rates going into effect in Pennsylvania? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we have a forward-looking test here in Pennsylvania, so I would say, on a trailing basis, we were earning it. And what this rate case included was our forward-looking costs as well as our customer consumption during that period of time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Excellent. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Pearson for closing comments. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Well, there are no more questions here. I'm sure you're holding them for us starting Sunday at EEI. So look forward to \u2013 we're going to be putting out some additional disclosures later today, and I look forward to seeing you all there. And hopefully by the time we come out of EEI, we plan to try to combine the Analyst Day that we've talked about for the last year and a half with EEI and share a lot of information about what we believe this fully regulated company is going to look like. So look forward to seeing you there. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp.'s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's fourth quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the PowerPoint presentation, which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 2016 was a successful and transformative year for FirstEnergy. Our long list of significant accomplishments includes achieving the operating earnings targets that we outlined to the financial community, making strong progress on our growth strategy, and launching a plan that supports our transition to a fully-regulated company. During today's call, Jim and I will review our results and recent developments, and provide an update on the strategic review of our Competitive business. While we have a great deal to cover, we still expect to have plenty of time for your questions. For the year, we reported GAAP loss of $14.49 per share as a result of impairments in our Competitive business, and I'll discuss those more in a few minutes. On an operating earnings basis, we achieved results of $2.63 per share for 2016, which is in line with the revised guidance we provided in November, and for the second year in a row, higher than our original operating earnings guidance for the year. We are proud of the track record we are building to consistently deliver on the commitments we've made. Like to briefly outline some of our major accomplishments. First, we achieved outstanding operational performance across our company in 2016 with excellent results in distribution and transmission service reliability and plant operations. I'm particularly pleased with our very strong safety results. In 2016, our employees achieved the best safety performance in our company's history. This is the second straight year of setting a new record for safety performance, and I believe this reflects the strong safety culture across our entire organization. On the financial front, we contributed $500 million worth of stock into our qualified pension plan in December. Coupled with cash contributions totaling $382 million earlier in the year, this more than satisfies our 2016 pension funding obligations, and took pension funding obligations off the table for 2017. We continued our focus on costs through our cash flow improvement plan, exceeding the original targets we laid out with incremental fuel and capital savings in our Competitive business. In addition, we successfully restructured our credit facilities to provide the necessary financial flexibility to become a fully regulated company. FirstEnergy Corporation and our regulated subsidiaries entered into three new five-year syndicated credit facilities in December. These replace facilities that were set to expire in 2019 and increased the credit available to our 10 distribution companies. We've also had very successful results from our regulated growth initiatives. In our Transmission business, we completed the transfer of Penelec and Met-Ed transmission assets into our new MAIT subsidiary late last month, following approval from both FERC and the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. While formula rates for both JCP&L and MAIT remain pending at FERC, we requested implementation effective January 1 and February 1 for JCPL (sic) [JCP&L] (5:38) and MAIT, respectively. We're on track for $1 billion in investments and are energizing the future growth initiative in 2017 with a majority of that spend taking place where we have formula rates. This is the last year of our initial $4.2 billion investment. In November, we announced the continuation of the program with $3.2 billion to $4.8 billion in transmission investments planned in 2018 through 2021. We also announced our plan to issue up to $500 million of incremental equity annually in 2017 through 2019 to help fund these investments. Turning to the Distribution business, we achieve resolution in several regulatory proceedings that will support continued investment in safe and reliable service for our customers. In Pennsylvania, we received approval of rates case settlements for our four operating companies with an expected Distribution revenue increase of approximately $290 million annually. In New Jersey, the approved settlement for JCP&L provides for an annual Distribution revenue increase of $80 million. And in Ohio, we will collect approximately $200 million annually for at least three years and up to five under the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider. The new rates and the Ohio Rider all went into effect last month. The combination of successful outcomes in these state proceedings, coupled with our cost savings initiatives, has helped us begin improving our credit metrics. We achieved FFO to debt levels in 2016 which exceeded the minimum thresholds established by both Moody's and S&P. We also reengaged coverage with Fitch and they recently began rating all of our entities. In December, Mon Power issued an RFP to address the generation shortfall identified in its Integrated Resource Plan, along with a second RFP to sell its interest in the Bath County Pumped Storage Project. RFP for the Integrated Resource Plan seeks a combination of approximately 1,300 megawatts of unforced capacity generation and up to 100 megawatts of demand response. Bids were due on February 3. Then Charles River Associates in their role as RFP manager began assessing each proposal to determine the best combination of value and reliability for the customers of Mon Power. The assessment includes cost factors, such as the expected customer impact, capacity availability, environmental considerations, and acquisition costs; as well as non-cost factors, such as West Virginia's preference for in-state fuel sources, location and ease of integration. We expect Mon Power to announce the results of both RFPs when it submits its regulatory filing to the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC in March. Finally, in late 2016, we launched a strategic review of our Competitive Generation business to support our exit from that business by mid-2018. This very complex process is on track and we're very pleased with the progress we have made in the short time since our announcement. In November, FES brought on two independent board members and three new employee board members, who reviewed and authorized FES's entry into a new two-year secured credit facility with FirstEnergy that provides liquidity support through 2018. FirstEnergy and FES have both engaged legal and financial advisors to help guide this transition. We're working on separating FES from the unregulated money pool, and as of January 31, FES, its operating subsidiaries and FENOC, in aggregate, had a money pool investment of $2 million. At this time, FES hasn't drawn on the secured credit facility that is in place with FirstEnergy, but we would expect them to use that facility in the future. The decision to assess strategic options and our intent to exit the Competitive business by mid-2018 made it necessary to reduce the carrying value of certain of our generating assets to their fair market value, which resulted in the non-cash free tax impairment charges of $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter. I'll note that we remain in compliance with financial covenants in our bank credit facilities as the majority of this after-tax charge is excluded from our covenant calculations of debt to total capitalization. These impairments, together with second quarter asset impairment and plant exit costs, primarily associated with Bay Shore, Sammis Units 1 through 4, and the goodwill at our Competitive business totaled $16.67 per share. While these are not the kind of results anyone likes to report, writing down the majority of our Competitive Generation assets was a necessary step towards our exit of Competitive Generation, regardless of which path we ultimately take. And it's an important step to more clearly reflect our business in 2017 and beyond. We continue to assess and evaluate a number of strategic alternatives for our companies \u2013 for our Competitive business, including asset sales, legislative or regulatory initiatives for generation that recognizes environmental or energy security benefits, alternatives for our retail business and financial restructuring. In January, we announced an agreement to sell 1,572 megawatts of gas and hydroelectric generation for $925 million in an all-cash deal, with net proceeds expected to exceed $300 million after we repay debt and associated make-whole call premiums. This includes the Springdale, Chambersburg, Gans and Hunlock gas units in Pennsylvania, as well as the competitive portion of our Bath Hydro unit in Virginia, which are all part of our Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiary. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of a number of regulatory approvals and consents from third parties. We continue to explore options for the sale of our West Lorain combined cycle facility and the Buchanan natural gas unit. Otherwise, while the potential of additional generating unit sales or deactivations remains on the table, we do not expect near-term developments in those areas. In West Virginia, our Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiary offered its 1,300 megawatt Pleasants plant into the Mon Power RFP earlier this month for approximately $195 million or $150 per KW. As I mentioned earlier, Mon Power is expected to announce the results of that RFP next month. In Ohio, we have had meaningful dialog with our fellow utilities and with legislators on solutions that can help ensure Ohio's future energy security. Our top priority is the preservation of our two nuclear plants in the state, and legislation for zero-emission nuclear program is expected to be introduced soon. The ZEN program is intended to give state lawmakers greater control and flexibility to preserve valuable nuclear generation. We believe this legislation would preserve not only zero-emission assets, but jobs, economic growth, fuel diversity, price stability, and reliability and grid security for the region. We are advocating for Ohio's support for its two nuclear plants, even though the likely outcome is that FirstEnergy won't be the long-term owner of these assets. We are optimistic given these discussions we've had so far, and we'll keep you posted as this process unfolds. On a related topic, as you may know, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission typically relies on parental support agreements to provide additional assurance that U.S. merchant nuclear plants have the financial resources to maintain safe operations, particularly in the event of an extraordinary situation. In addition to the $500 million credit facility provided to FES by FirstEnergy that provides for ordinary operating liquidity needs, FirstEnergy is now working with FES to establish conditional credit support on terms and conditions to be agreed upon for the $400 million FES parental support agreement that is currently in place, benefiting FE Nuclear Generation. As always, the continued safe operation of these nuclear assets is of utmost importance and is consistent with our pursuit of environmental credits for the assets through a ZEN program. Moving back to our review of the Competitive business, I'd like to add that we may also explore the possibility of engaging creditors to restructure debt at FES. And as we discussed, there remains the possibility that FES and potentially FENOC may seek bankruptcy protection, although no such decision has been made. This initial phase of our review has been productive and we will continue sharing updates with you as we move forward. We remain committed to implementing our exit from Competitive Generation by mid-2018 to complete our transformation into a regulated company. While we're speaking of generation, we received numerous questions about Bruce Mansfield's operating status last week. So I wanted to clear up some confusion. First, the new dewatering facility is in place and it is working as designed. We have had some of the normal growing pains with obtaining the right consistency for the byproducts at the third-party disposal site; however, we are working with a contractor and believe we're on track to resolve that issue. All three units at Mansfield are operational, but they are currently on economic reserve due to low power prices, consistent with our normal dispatch strategy. Before I turn it over to Jim, I'll spend a minute reviewing our expectations for 2017. As we announced yesterday, we're raising operating earnings guidance for the year. This primarily reflects improvements at our Competitive business related to the significant reduction in depreciation expense resulting from the fourth quarter impairment, somewhat offset by advisory costs and the commodity margin impact of the proposed asset sale. Our GAAP earnings forecast is now $2.47 to $2.77 per share. Operating earnings guidance has been raised to $2.70 to $3.00 per share from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share that we announced at EEI. In our regulated businesses, we continue to anticipate a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 6% from our 2016 weather-adjusted base, or 7% to 9%, when including the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider through 2019. We will seek incremental opportunities for growth in our regulated businesses in the next few years. Again, we have much to be proud of in 2016 from solid operating results to our operating performance, and the progress we are making towards our goals. In 2017, we'll remain fully focused on positioning the company for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report, which was posted to our website yesterday afternoon. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A session or following the call. As Chuck explained, the impairment of our competitive assets resulted in a fourth quarter GAAP charge of $13.54, and this drove our GAAP loss of $13.44 per share in the fourth quarter, and $14.49 per share for the full year. A full list of special items can be found in the consolidated report. Operating earnings were $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter and $2.63 per share for the year. As Chuck indicated, these results were stronger than our original estimates and in line with our revised operating earnings guidance. In our Distribution business, fourth quarter deliveries increased 4% overall compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of higher weather-related usage and stronger commercial and industrial demand. While heating degree days were 26% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, they were 9% below normal, and this milder-than-normal weather impacted our fourth quarter results as compared to our guidance. Fourth quarter 2016 residential deliveries increased 8% compared to last year and were flat on a weather-adjusted basis. Commercial deliveries were up 3% or 1% when adjusted for weather. In the industrial sector, deliveries increased 1.8%, driven primarily by higher usage in the shale and steel sectors. This follows a similar increase in the third quarter 2016, and we remain cautiously optimistic about these positive trends. We are forecasting a 3.5% increase in industrial deliveries in 2017. Moving to our Transmission business, fourth quarter earnings increased by $0.02 per share due to higher revenues related to our Energizing the Future program. And in our corporate segment, results were primarily impacted by higher operating expenses and interest expenses. In our Competitive business, operating earnings were slightly better than our expectations. Commodity margin decreased due to lower capacity revenues related to the capacity prices that went into effect in June as well as lower contract sales volume. This was partially offset by increased wholesale sales, lower capacity expense, and a lower fuel rate, as well as lower-than-anticipated operating expenses. The customer count for our Competitive business is currently about 1.1 million down from 1.6 million. In 2016, our contract sales were 53 million megawatt hours with 15 million megawatt hours being sold in the wholesale spot market. On an annual basis, we currently have about 70 million to 75 million megawatt hours to sell, decreasing to 65 million to 70 million megawatt hours once we complete the gas and hydro asset sale. As we carefully manage our collateral exposure at FES in light of its credit quality, we are closing out certain forward financial hedges we made for 2017 and 2018. This will reduce the committed sales we have and increase our open position for spot sales going forward. As a result, we expect contract sales to total 40 million megawatt hours in 2017 and 2018 with the remainder sold in the spot market. Before I open the call to your questions, I'll spend a minute going over potential implications of some of the tax reform proposals that have been getting quite a bit of attention lately. We have been very engaged with others in our industry to work toward an outcome that would minimize any negative impacts. With ideas still percolating from the House, the Senate, and the President, it is too early to speculate on the details of an eventual tax reform proposal. But based on the blueprint that was released by the House last year, we can give you a sense of how that tax proposal might impact FirstEnergy. Any decrease in the effective tax rate at the utilities could result in lower rates for customers, which would flow through to our FFO given that we aren't a federal cash taxpayer. In addition, since we have about $8 billion of holding company debt between FirstEnergy Corp. and FET, the loss of interest deductibility would disallow approximately $300 million of interest expense, which would negatively impact earnings by at least $0.20 per share. Finally, with 100% bonus depreciation, we would not anticipate being a federal cash taxpayer in the near future. Again, we are working closely with others in our industry to educate Congressional leaders about the importance of interest deductibility for companies like ours. We do support sensible tax reforms which would ultimately benefit the overall economy and industries in our service territory, and we will remain focused on this important and evolving legislation. As Chuck said, 2016 was a very productive year for FirstEnergy and we are pleased with our progress on our regulated growth strategy. We remain committed to positioning the company for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. Now, I'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to discuss the zero-emission approach in Ohio, and just wanted to think about that in the context of potentially seeking bankruptcy protection. Would a success in Ohio preclude the need for bankruptcy protection or would it more likely simply allow the nuclear units to continue operating, but might not impact your overall decision about seeking bankruptcy protection for FES? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, here's what I said in my prepared remarks, and I'll elaborate on it a little bit. I think that it is very important for the state of Ohio to look to the future and how they're going to provide for energy security, grid security, and not just from an electric perspective, the economic impact in terms of jobs and taxes and so forth that are associated with these two facilities. I've been very upfront with the legislators that I have met with personally to tell them don't do this for FirstEnergy because it's unlikely we're going to be the long-term owner operators of these assets. So now, your second question on how that might enter into a bankruptcy? That decision is going to be ultimately made by the FES board. And the FES board's going to look at what impact that has at that point in time. I think, though, it's very unlikely. You saw what we did with the impairment on the assets. That leaves the book value of our FES business somewhere around $1.5 billion and we've already communicated what the secured and unsecured debt associated with that business is. I think it's highly unlikely we'll get the value of that business to a place where the book value is greater than the debt. So... Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. That makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So, first quick question here a little bit on the numbers. Just in terms of reconciling FFO from the Competitive segment relative to adjusted EBITDA, obviously, adjusted EBITDA going down. But the FFO numbers are a little bit higher net-net versus the adjusted EBITDA. What's the reconciliation there? And also can you discuss \u2013 I imagine the bulk of the FFO is at the FES side of the CES business. To what extent should we kind of consider that as kind of a proxy for the FES cash flows, minus perhaps a little bit for the remaining coal asset on the other side of Pleasants (27:22)? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Let me take a shot at that, Julien, a lot of questions out there. Let me talk about the Competitive segment free cash flow. Let me start with that. It's up a little over $400 million. And what's driving that is the asset sale generated about $815 million. But then when you get into some other components, increased advisory fees are reducing it by about $90 million. The commodity margin is down about $95 million. That's associated with the sale of the AES assets. And also the cash receipts at the Competitive segments are down about $180 million. This is associated with the gain on the sale. So when I take that to the FirstEnergy level, the FFO is down about $200 million from the original guidance. And that's primarily the advisory fees that we're paying of about $90 million, as well as the reduced commodity margin, about a $95 million. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then just reconciling adjusted EBITDA versus FFO? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. When you look at the adjusted EBITDA, again, it's impacted primarily by the lower commodity margin of about $95 million as well as the advisory fees that were $90 million. So, those are the primary drivers there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, the 10-K references a February 24 decision here on the coal litigation. Do you expect to 8-K that and/or (29:16) any further rollout of data points after that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I don't think it references a February 24 decision. It says that that's the end of the initial phase of the hearing on whether or not \u2013 or where the liability is going to fall. Following that, the arbitration panel has time yet to then make their decision on liability. And then following that, there would be additional time, if there is liability, to determine what that liability would be. So we're... Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: ...several months, at least, away from knowing any damages, if there are to be damages, and a while away from knowing what the arbitrators decide on liability. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Excellent. And just a last quick one, what was the earned ROE in Pennsylvania across the utilities in 2016? I know you disclosed it for 2015 here in the disclosures, but just to reconcile. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: As a result of our last rate case that settled, it was a black box, so there was no ROE. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Fair enough. I'll follow it offline. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. John Kiani with Cove Key Management (30:44). Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Morning. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: Morning. Unknown Speaker : I'm trying to make sure I can reconcile the amount and add up the amount of support that FE Corp. is giving to FES, just wanted to see if I'm thinking about this correctly. Is the $400 million incremental \u2013 or additional credit support for the Nuclear Generation business that you disclosed in the K and on slide six of your deck, is that incremental to the $500 million secured revolver that you all put in place between the parent and FES and the $200 million additional credit support or LC facility as well? So, is the total $500 million plus $400 million plus $200 million, or how should I think about that, please? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, let's take the $400 off to the side here for a second. There is an obligation under our agreements with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to maintain $400 million of liquidity. That can be accomplished by liquidity or by a parental guarantee that we would backstop that liquidity. That is what we're working on. That would only ever be exercised in the event of an extraordinary set of conditions resulting in all four of our nuclear reactors being offline for an extended period of time. Other than that, it's an insurance policy to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but there's not an opportunity for FES to draw down on that. And we're talking about three nuclear plants that are excellent operating nuclear plants. Well, at least, two that are at the high end and one at \u2013 I mean, they have run very, very well. So, the likelihood of all three sites and all four units being off for an extended period of time is very, very unlikely. But there is a requirement that we ensure that there is liquidity available under our agreements with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The $500 million you know about already. And then what was the \u2013 go ahead. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: The $200 million, that was a guarantee on the surety bonds. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes. So, those two are both additive. Unknown Speaker : And that $200 million, is that where the LC is posted to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for Little Blue Run? Is that correct? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah, John (33:24). Yeah, that makes up about $169 million of the $200 million. That's right. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then, along the same lines of the nuclear support, in the hypothetical event of a FES or nuclear generation bankruptcy, who is ultimately liable for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts or any shortfalls or topping off that would need to be done at the \u2013 for the NDT? Is it FES? Or is it possible that FE Corp. could be required to guarantee it, because some of the licenses sit at FENOC? How should we think about that, please? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, at the time that that would occur, the Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts would be funded at an appropriate level. And as long as those assets continue to run, would continue to get funded through the useful life of the plants. Ultimately, where that ends up, I believe, and I'm going to ask Leila to help me here, will be determined through a bankruptcy process, if there's a bankruptcy. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, just to add a little bit more detail, it's licensee owner that would be responsible. In our case, that's our nuclear gen-co. Right now, the NDTs, given the license duration, is fully-funded. So, FirstEnergy right now is not responsible; it is the license owner. Unknown Speaker : Got it. And then, one more last question, please. How should we just think about or how would the board of FES or, just in general, how do you think about managing the liquidity of FES and the June 1 putable maturity that exists? I think the business generates a lot of its free cash flow typically towards the latter half of the year, but obviously that maturity is coming up sooner than that. So, how do you think about paying that maturity off or not in the context of how the free cash flow of the business is a little bit more back end of the year weighted, please? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, in the context of the environment that we are operating in, that's not a question for FirstEnergy to answer. We have begun the process of separating FES and FirstEnergy when we put in place a separate board for FES. And that's a decision that the FES board is going to have to wrestle with as that date approaches. Unknown Speaker : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning, guys. Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just wanted to follow-up on John's (36:21) questions here, and I apologize for me being a little dense, but what is the total amount \u2013 the $400 million, you were very clear on, what \u2013 that's associated with all the four nuclear reactors being shut down. But what is the amount absent that that we should think about as being the parent's commitment to FES? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, Paul, I would say the commitment to FES is a $500 million secured credit facility and that's secured by first mortgage bonds as well as a $200 million surety bond, which is also secured. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Now, we have stated that FirstEnergy Corp. guarantees the entire amount of the pension and executive deferred compensation benefit plans, which we consider that, and always have considered that, an FE Corp. responsibility. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : How much is that again? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That would be in the range of about $1 billion and that will change as the discount rates change as well as we make future contributions to the pension plan. And as Chuck said, we do not have any requirements to make any pension contributions in 2017. However, the period 2018 through 2021, we have about $1.8 billion of required pension contributions and about $700 million years thereafter. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: And aside from that, Paul, I think we've been very clear that we do not intend to support that business from FirstEnergy any longer. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then the $400 million associated with the NRC commitment, you guys are looking for ZECs, and I guess what I'm wondering is, what \u2013 that would suggest that some of these plants or some of these reactors are at economic risk for closure. Am I wrong? So, how should we think about the need for ZECs, and if that weren't forthcoming, the likelihood that these reactors might have to shut down? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I can't speak for prospective new owners of these four nuclear units. But I can tell you this. Running nuclear reactors isn't something that just anybody can do. And there is a significant amount of capital risk associated with that business, depending on how these assets, if there's a restructuring or a bankruptcy, where they ultimately go, and who ultimately owns them. I'm not sure people are going to be willing to take on the risk of even the next refueling outage, which is very expensive. So, I don't think there's any guarantee, absent some other support for these units, that they're going to keep running far into the future. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much for the clarity. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, on the nuclear point \u2013 Hi. So, on the nuclear point, just wanted to clarify, clearly, as you pointed out right, it's not \u2013 there's very few real buyers for nuclear assets in the market. And if there weren't ZECs, it's very unlikely that somebody steps up. Is that a fair way of understanding it that if there are no ZECs, what is the situation you're left with at that point? Because if there's no buyer for it, are you going to hold on \u2013 are you forced to hold on to the assets, or how should we think of that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think you should think about it this way. And I said earlier, these assets are now valued at somewhere around $1.5 billion. And that includes the nuclear fuel that they own. The debt is significantly higher than that. Absent something to raise the value of these units and make them attractive to a buyer, there's only one way for us to exit this business. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Fair enough. Understood. And then secondly, I know that on the call you've mentioned some of the forward hedges of contracts that you had have been sold to minimize the support. Just want to understand, how is that treated? Like, is that treated as cash today? And is that flowing into EBITDA or cash flow? Where does that sit right now, the benefit of the sale of the forward contracts? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Any benefit of unwinding of those forward contracts would flow through. I think the key component is, is it reduces the amount of collateral that we were required to have outstanding. So, that impacts our cash. And from the end of the year until where we are right now, we've reduced our collateral requirements by about $70 million. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. No, I get the collateral requirement benefit. I'm just trying to figure out like just where does that sit, like, in your forecast or in your \u2013 is it in cash flow, free cash, but not in EBITDA, just so I understand where that does (41:45)? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's right. It would be in our cash flow. Any gains or losses associated with unwinding that would flow through to EBITDA, but that was not anything that would be material. Just the return of the cash would be part of our cash flow. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Jon. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a question on the tax reform slide. Firstly, I just want to make sure I understand the $0.20 number that you referenced in the second bullet. Is that discrete to eliminating interest expense deductions at the hold-co? And am I correct that there'd be maybe another dime or so of exposure just from the lower tax rate on the parent company drag, or am I thinking about that wrong? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: No, the way I would think about that, Jonathan, is we've got a little over $300 million in interest expense, and losing that 35% deductibility is about $100 million. And you divide it by your shares outstanding, that's how you get to the number we were talking about there. We did not try to quantify anything else at that point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, that was just the interest component of the parent company? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's purely the interest component associated with that. That's correct. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, you obviously are flagging the risk to your FFO. Can you talk at all about potential implications given where you are on credit metrics at certain scenarios and maybe frame that a little more for us? And maybe what your priority responses might be if you needed to address it? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, Jonathan, over the last couple of years, I have resisted trying to guess about what the future might be. And I think this whole tax reform issue is getting a lot of attention. Obviously, all of my other peers have commented on it. Whether or not it even happens in my mind is a question and what version happens. There's a different version that the President has than what the House has and what the Senate has, and we haven't even started to really run all those issues to ground. I will tell you this. I've been attending EEI CEO meetings since 2001, and our industry coalesced around what the right answer for our industry is with regard to this, quicker on this issue than I have ever seen it happened. Several of my peers, who I have a tremendous amount of respect for, have already been to Washington DC to talk about the impact on our industry. And what they're trying to do with tax reform is inject money into the economy from a supply side to jumpstart this economy. Capital formation in our industry is not a problem. And this would actually have the inverse effect on our industry of what they're trying to accomplish. So, I think our representatives felt like they had meaningful discussions. And so, I don't think there's any reason for us to be playing Doomsday at this point with regard to FirstEnergy or anyone else in this industry. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Would your inclination be to step up capital spend, I guess? Really, my question is whether \u2013 because others have emphasized that as being an offset. I felt you're not really doing that. Is the balance sheet a constraint on going down that path, or do you think you would be playing that card, too? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: As I said, if you can tell me where it's going to end up, then we can tell you how we will react to it. But I'm not going to speculate about where it's going to end up or the impact it's going to have on what we do. I do think, obviously, if the House plan got accepted exactly as it's been promulgated so far, it would be a difficult issue for our industry to wrestle with. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Chuck. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Gregg Orrill with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about the taxes a little bit in terms of \u2013 you're not a cash taxpayer. Would it be possible to provide some guidance around how much of the benefits come from the NOL versus the taking of bonus depreciation, or at least, mechanically, give us a way to think about how both of those are impacting the cash flows? K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Gregg, this is Jon. As you know, we're not a federal cash taxpayer today. The federal NOL as of the end of the year was $5 billion. So, we don't anticipate being a federal taxpayer for some time until (47:17) 2021, 2022. With respect to bonus, we've been dealing with some form of bonus depreciation for the last 5 to 10 years, and it's just something that we'll have to continue to look at. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ms. Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, just one follow-up. So, I'm look at your financial plan slide from the fourth quarter fact-book and compare it against the EEI financial plan slide, and there's a small change in the wording. You are skipping the word for FE Corp. from your commitment to investment-grade credit rating. Is that intentional? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: We are committed to investment-grade credit metrics at FE Corp. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Just I'm trying to get a proxy in thinking about those core regulated businesses at FE. Could you talk a little bit about what you're kind of expecting for growth on the Distribution side after 2017 and kind of compare that to growth on the Regulated Transmission side after 2017? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, I would say, Michael, that what we're talking about is average annual growth for T&D of 4% to 6% per year. It would be ramped up a little bit in the earlier years because of the $200 million that we're receiving in Ohio. But obviously, that goes away at some point in time. And the way I think about it is this. We have numerous investment mechanisms through riders on the Distribution side of our company in Ohio and Pennsylvania, in particular. We have formula rates so far with ATSI and TrAILCo. And eventually, when we get another FERC Commissioner, we'll have one for MAIT and JCP&L. So, we have the ability to move those funds around quite a bit between T&D and from state to state, et cetera, et cetera. And that gives us a lot of flexibility to address some of the reliability challenges that we see on our wire side of our company. And hopefully, at some point, some of the load growth that we're going to see on the wire side of our company. So, I think you should think about it in terms of the combination of the two, because we're going to move money around. And I think, probably, in the very near future, we're going to start having dialog with the Ohio Commission on their grid modernization ideas. The extent we move forward there, that has the same return on equity as a transmission formula rate. So, that might move some money around there too. So there's just so many moving parts, I don't want to commit that it's going to be this for Transmission and this for Distribution. I'd rather just tell you, you can count on 4% to 6%. And as I said in my remarks, as we move a little bit farther down the tracks, we're going to look at ways to ramp that up over the next few years. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And just curious on the Transmission \u2013 actually, before I ask that one, I want to come back to New Jersey, because you brought up JCP&L a little bit. Some of your peers in New Jersey have very different rate-making mechanisms than what JCP&L has. Just curious, where are you in the process, if anywhere, in talking with interveners and with the BPU about being able to adopt some of those same rate-making mechanisms for JCP&L? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, here's what I would say. We finally got a settlement on a rate case in New Jersey for the first time in the 15 years that we've owned JCP&L. That was a tremendous accomplishment on our part. We've had a lots of issues over there with four horrific storms, with some reliability issues early on in our ownership of JCP&L, with some union issues early on in our ownership of JCP&L. I think the settlement on this case was a big step forward for us in terms of our relationship in New Jersey. We would not have been able to get that accomplished if we didn't have solid relationships with our local elected officials that are much better than they ever were, with the BPU, and if we weren't performing over there. So, that's all a good place to be. The paint isn't even dry on that settlement yet. It just went into effect last month. So, I think now is the time that over time we'll start having discussions with the BPU about what types of investments do they want to see and what mechanisms would they be interested in considering to do it. And more to come on that. But we're not having any right now. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, and sorry for getting disconnected earlier. Just had one quick follow-up on the pension obligation at the Competitive business. I think I saw in the appendix that the net impact was about $700 million rather than $1 billion. But I just wanted to check on the magnitude of the liability, essentially, that the parent company has for that pension? Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.: Steve, it's Steve Staub. It also takes into consideration the OPEB, which actually has a positive balance, so it nets out to about $700 million with respect to the pension and OPEB. And then, there's some other guarantees that Jim had mentioned specific to the executive deferred comp as well as some other small guarantees that add up to about $1 billion. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. That's all I had. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Just hopefully two quick questions. One, it appears that if a ZEC does get passed in Ohio, it's \u2013 I don't know if to use these words, unlikely that FE would be the owner of these assets, would that change FE's \u2013 would FE's intention \u2013 would you be inclined to own a nuclear plant if they were rate based? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I don't see any possibility that they're going to be rate based in the timeframe that I've committed to you that we're going to exit this Competitive Generation. So, I don't even think we should even be talking about that. We are going to work hard on this ZEN legislation, because I believe it's the right thing to do for the state of Ohio. I believe it's the right thing to do for these assets. I believe it's the right thing to do for our employees that work at these facilities. And I think it's the right thing to do for those communities that these big, huge manufacturing facilities are resident in. So, we're going to do it for all the right reasons, even though it's not going to, ultimately, I don't think, have any impact to the shareholder value of FirstEnergy over the long haul. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And just lastly, a more housekeeping. On the fourth quarter \u2013 in fourth quarter results, corporate and other took a charge, I guess, for legacy coal plants. Any reason that was not at the op-cos? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Now, that... Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Go ahead. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Those are assets that were former GPU assets. They are those manufactured gas plants. So, they don't really pertain to any of the other segments. That's why we've decided to keep them there. In fact, last year, we had a similar charge, but it was not in the fourth quarter. So, we've just been recording it in that segment. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay, Stephen (sic) [Anthony] (56:04). Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.: Thank you. Just a quick one on Transmission. You have a pretty tight earnings guidance range; $360 million to $380 million, yet there's a lot of uncertainty with respect to the timing and eventual outcome of some of these FERC-related cases and obviously with the vacancy on the FERC Commission. Does that range still take into account that uncertainty? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Charles, no, this is Jim. No, that range was based on having those rates go into effect January 1. At a time that we find out that something may be different than that, then we'll update that guidance. But what you're looking at is assuming that both MAIT and JCP&L go into effect at the beginning of the year. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.: Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Go ahead. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I would add on to that, though, that inside a company that's as big as ours, with 10 regulated distribution companies and the transmission footprint that we have, we have the ability, in the interim until we have certainty on how we're going to get our returns through MAIT, to move some of our capital plan around into other formula rates. And I am not excusing our energy delivery leader from meeting his earnings targets this year just because that's been delayed. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: And, Charles, this is Leila. One point of clarification. So, staff does now have some delegated authority. And if they so \u2013 chose to do so, they could use that delegated authority and put the rates into effect January 1, February 1, subject to refund. So you don't need the FERC (57:56) Commissioner in order for that to happen is my point. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.: Okay, Leila. So, these issues are staff \u2013 are at the level that the staff could make a decision? Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: Correct. They're within staff domain at this point. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Liou with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my call. I think in the beginning, you mentioned that you're in the process of separating FES from the unregulated money pool. Can you just expand on that a little? What are the kind of final hurdles there? Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah, it's Steve. We are in a process of doing that and we expect by the end of the first quarter to have FES, its subsidiaries, and FENOC operating under their own separate money pool. And so, we expect to have that in place shortly. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then for the asset sale proceeds, I saw that in your presentation, you changed 2019 issuance guidance. Is that kind of telegraphing potential de-levering at the holding company? Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.: Can you repeat your question, please? Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In your EEI presentation, I think for 2019, you talked about refinancing the term loan that's due then. In the fourth quarter presentation, that's missing from the financing plan. So, is that kind of telegraphing that maybe you'll look to pay down that 2019 term loan? Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, the 2019 term loan was refinanced in December of 2016, in line with the restructuring of our credit facilities. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So, that just kind of pushed out everything. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's right. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, just the last one, Chuck, you mentioned West Lorain and Buchanan as potential asset sales. But also, you touched upon the alternatives for the retail business. Can you just talk a little bit more about what are you looking at there? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I can't talk about what we're looking at there, because again I think that is going to be the responsibility of the FES board to look at it. But I think what I said is, other than West Lorain and Buchanan, I don't think you should expect any announcements in the near future. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Pearson for closing comment. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: All right. So, I'll take over for Jim, and just like to thank you all for your continued support of FirstEnergy, your questions. Look forward to seeing many of you in Boston next week. And then, Jim will see some of you in New York next week. So, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corporation First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today's call, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corporation. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's first quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the PowerPoint presentation which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim Pearson. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Meghan, and good morning, everyone. We are changing up the order today. I'm going to lead off with a discussion of our first quarter financial results and then I'll turn it over to Chuck for a review of recent developments and strategic updates. We are off to a very strong start in 2017 with solid first quarter results that exceeded our operating earnings guidance and were supported by excellent operational performance across the company. We continue to execute on our regulated growth initiatives and, as Chuck will discuss later, we are encouraged by recent energy policy discussions that could ultimately have a positive impact on the nation's electric system. Last night, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share, which includes a $164 million pre-tax charge related to two coal contract disputes. Chuck will discuss this item later in the call. First quarter operating earnings were $0.78 per share, reflecting strong results in all three business units. Before I walk through each segment, I'll remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which is posted on our website. In our Distribution business first quarter earnings increased due to the impact of new rates that went into effect in January at eight of our 10 operating companies. As you'll recall, the Ohio distribution modernization rider and the new base rates in New Jersey became effective on January 1, while new base rates in Pennsylvania were put in place on January 27. Weather was unseasonably mild across our service area, with heating degree days averaging 8% lower than the first quarter of 2016 and 16% below normal. This drove a 1% decrease in total distribution deliveries, with sales to residential and commercial customers down 3% and 1% respectively. On a weather-adjusted basis, however, sales within both segments have improved slightly on both a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis, due primarily to growth in customer count. And we are very pleased to see a continued positive trend in our Industrial segment where deliveries were up for the third consecutive quarter as a result of higher usage in the shale, steel, and mining sectors. Turning to our Transmission business, higher revenues related to our ongoing Energizing the Future program drove the improvement in first quarter earnings compared to the same period last year. In March, FERC accepted the formula transmission rates for both MAIT and JCP&L that will go into effect, subject to refund, on July 1 and June 1 respectively. In the competitive business, commodity margin reflected the expected decrease in capacity revenues related to lower prices that began last June, partially offset by lower depreciation expense that resulted from the asset impairments recorded at the end of 2016. However, overall results for our competitive business exceeded our first quarter operating earnings forecast, primarily due to lower-than-expected planned outage and contractor cost. The total customer count for the competitive business is now about 920,000, down from 1.6 million a year ago and 1.1 million in January, consistent with our expectations. As we mentioned in February, we expect contract sales totaling 40 million to 45 million megawatt hours this year, with the remainder sold into the spot market. We are reaffirming 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $405 million to $475 million for the competitive business and have increased 2018 adjusted EBITDA range to $130 million to $250 million. Again, we are pleased with the performance across our company and the positive start to 2017. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing the regulated growth strategy we have outlined. Last night, we provided a second quarter GAAP earnings forecast of $0.54 to $0.64 per share, with operating earnings guidance of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. For the full year of 2017, we have updated our GAAP earnings forecast to $2.17 to $2.47 per share from the previous range of $2.47 to $2.77 per share, primarily to reflect the charge I mentioned earlier. On an operating earnings basis, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance of $2.70 to $3 per share. Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim indicated, I'm going to focus some of the recent developments related to our transition to a regulated company and our goal of exiting commodity-exposed generation by mid-2018. Overall, I am pleased with our progress on this effort and we're glad to have one of the significant open items resolved. On Wednesday, we announced the outcome of the arbitration decision in the first of two coal transportation contract disputes. In that case, our generation subsidiary reached a settlement in principle with CSX and BNSF for $109 million payable in three annual installments beginning next month and guaranteed by FirstEnergy. In addition to this settlement, we are in active settlement discussions with BNSF and NS on the remaining contract that is in litigation. The potential settlements would put a significant risk to FES and FirstEnergy behind us. I'll also note that absent these settlements, under accounting rules, we would have been required to take a significant charge this quarter based on the probable outcome of the damage hearings, which would have impacted both FES and FirstEnergy. We also continue to move forward with our other strategic alternatives for our competitive business. As we discussed in the fourth quarter call, we entered into an agreement in January to sell 1,572 megawatts of Allegheny Energy Supply's gas and hydroelectric generation for $925 million in an all-cash deal. We hope to close this transaction in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and consents from third parties. We also entered into a $40 million agreement earlier this month to sell a portion of the real property and certain assets at the former Hatfield's Ferry Power Station in Masontown, Pennsylvania for the development of a 1,000 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas facility. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to various closing conditions. Allegheny Energy Supply will continue to own the remaining Hatfield plant facilities and property. In West Virginia, following a competitive RFP process and recommendation from an independent consultant, our Mon Power utility entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the 1,300 megawatt Pleasants Power Station from Allegheny Energy Supply. At a cost of $195 million or $150 per kilowatt, this option was found to be the lowest cost solution to meet a steadily increasing capacity shortfall in our West Virginia service territory. The transfer is subject to approval from both the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC. Hearings are scheduled at the Public Service Commission with an order from the Commission expected by year-end. FERC approval is also expected in the fourth quarter. You will recall that Mon Power has issued a second RFP seeking to sell its interest in the Bath County Pumped Storage Project, but we will not be moving forward with that proposed sale at this time. In addition to these initiatives, we are closely monitoring two important new developments at the state and federal level. On the legislative front, bills were introduced in both the Ohio House and Senate this month that could help keep nuclear assets as part of Ohio's generation mix. The Zero Emission Nuclear Resource Program, or ZEN, is intended to recognize the critical energy security environmental attributes of nuclear power plants in Ohio by compensating them on a per-megawatt-hour basis. This is similar to the programs already in place in New York and Illinois, as well as legislation recently introduced in Connecticut. The New York and Illinois programs have extended the benefits of four nuclear power plants that were once slated for premature closure. ZEN has the potential to do the same thing for Davis-Besse and Perry, while supporting Ohio jobs, economic growth, reliable and affordable generation, and environmental progress for years to come. I had the opportunity to testify at the initial hearing on ZEN, which was held in the Ohio House earlier this week. Multiple hearings are expected in each chamber prior to summer recess, and we are working to get a bill on the governor's desk as quickly as possible. Finally, we are very pleased that the Trump administration has launched an initiative to address the national, economic and security risks associated with the premature closure of baseload generation in our country. As you may know, on April 14, U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, ordered a study to examine the overall value that baseload generation, including coal and nuclear plants, provides to the nation and ensure electric customers continue to benefit from a secure, affordable and resilient grid. Secretary Perry requested a plan by mid-June that evaluates the extent to which regulations, subsidies and tax policies have impacted the premature retirement of baseload power plants and whether energy markets adequately compensate the inherent benefits of existing baseload assets. We appreciate the administration's strong leadership in this area, and we are fully committed to supporting this effort. In light of the potential positive impact that either of these developments could have in the near term, the FES board has informed me that it plans to see how the Ohio initiative and the 60-day study at the Department of Energy play out. I believe this approach is in the best interest of both FES and FirstEnergy. Take a moment to review FES's situation. Based on the potential for the positive federal and state developments, FES will continue to have access to the unregulated money pool. As of March 31, FES and its subsidiaries and FENOC in aggregate were borrowing $50 million from the unregulated money pool. In addition, FES is forecasted to be free cash flow neutral through March of 2018. And this free cash flow neutral position is conservative as it reflects FES satisfying its June 1 bond maturity, lease and interest payments, as well as other obligations. With continued access to the unregulated money pool and the $500 million secured credit facility from FirstEnergy, which is currently undrawn, we have not moved forward with a parental nuclear support agreement that we discussed last quarter, but may do so in the future if conditions change. We remained focused on executing our plan to exit the commodity-exposed generation business. I'm encouraged by the possible developments and their potential impact. We should have a better indication of how these items will progress over the next several months. As Jim said, we're off to a good start in 2017 with strong operating earnings, solid operational performance and progress on our regulated growth strategies. And we continue working to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. Now I'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Chuck, you mentioned that the FES board informed FirstEnergy that they'd like to wait for the Department of Energy review and for the Ohio process to play out. Maybe we could talk about Department of Energy just for a moment. I guess I'm thinking about what the range of possible support could be. And I guess I have some skepticism because DOE's authority is somewhat limited. It would require other agencies potentially to get involved. So, even after DOE comes back with a report, isn't there kind of a risk of either a significant amount of time for implementation, risk in implementation, and doesn't that have the potential to sort of drag out the process for exiting the business? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, Stephen, here's what I'm going to say about that DOE initiative, and obviously since it came out, we've had a lot of discussions and I've personally been down in D.C. and talked to people both at DOE and in the administration. To put a 60-day time on completing this is very aggressive. I think they view it as something that needs to be very aggressive because there are more and more closures of these fuel-secure baseload assets being announced all the time. So I think the administration is serious about this. Our Washington team tells me that this is a very serious initiative. I don't think we're in any position right now to handicap what they might do at the end of this study. But if their intention is to keep these fuel-secure baseload assets from closing, then they're going to have to do something to make sure that there's a financial incentive for these plants to not close. So I think it's prudent for us to let them do their work. It's clear DOE is focused on this. The Secretary was speaking at a Bloomberg conference earlier this week and talked about it there and the importance of this. And I'm sure this also clearly ties in to one of the President's key initiatives, which is to protect our coal natural resource and the mining and jobs that go along with that. So I think it's just prudent for us to see where that goes. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understand. And then maybe I could just shift over to the upcoming debt refinancing requirement at FES. What is the current plan in terms of how that would be dealt with? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I cannot speak for FES anymore. As part of our process to move out of this commodity-exposed business, we have set up a separate governance process for FES. It has now an independent board. And while I may have the opportunity to answer their questions from time-to-time, the decisions are theirs. But I would say that, since they've told me they plan to wait to see this DOE initiative and they're in the money pool, it's likely that they would satisfy those obligations that are coming due in June 1 out of the money pool. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. So they could avail themselves of the money pool presumably. That's an option that's fair to say is on the table? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Correct. But as I've said in my prepared remarks, they will be free cash flow neutral this year, even after satisfying those obligations. So we're not exposing FirstEnergy shareholders to any additional obligation by waiting to see the outcome of this study either. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. I'll let others ask questions. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, Chuck, but there seems to be a change in the timeline. And I understand that the DOE study came up, but I mean you have this June 1 maturity, there's been this discussion about the growing concern, question about FES. You've just extended an additional guarantee to the business. Is this purely on the back of the DOE study? Or is it that you feel that there's more of a chance to get the Ohio events in support of the nuclear plants? I mean, there seems to be many questions and changes in the strategy around FES as of late. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I would just say this. As far as I see it, there is absolutely no change in the strategic direction that we want to take this company in. We do not want to be exposed to commodity-exposed generation any longer than we have to be. So let's talk about, just for a minute, the steps we have taken to move towards that. We announced the sale of 1,500, almost 1,600 megawatts of Allegheny Energy Supply assets. We're working on Pleasants. If we complete both of those by the end of the year, which I expect to happen, that's almost 3,000 megawatts less exposure to the commodity markets than what we had. We completed a major initiative with the banks at the end of last year to restructure our bank lines and position this company for this exit a little differently. We've engaged legal teams and restructuring teams and financial advisors on both sides of the company that have begun the process and are well along in the process to understand what may happen if a bankruptcy or restructuring is the only way for us to exit this business. But that is a very complicated process and we're working our way through it. That means we have to understand what is the implication for FirstEnergy shareholders on the FirstEnergy side, and that means the FES board has to understand all the implications that they need to deal with on the FirstEnergy Solutions side. That work is ongoing and it is not going to stop. I think many people assumed that the June 1 maturities would be a trigger. But given the position of FES this year with being free cash flow neutral, I'm not sure that was a good assumption that anybody was making in the first place because they need to be prepared and this company needs to be prepared before we take that step. And then the last thing I would say is I'm not sure it even affects the timeline. The DOE study is ongoing. It's going to happen quick. When we see the results of that study, then we may say it could affect the timeline. But just the study itself I'm not sure affects the timeline. So that leaves, I think, in the last piece of your question, Angie, was the guarantee that we gave... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: The guarantee. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. The guarantee that we gave on the rail settlement. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: The rail-centric \u2013 yes. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: And as I said in my remarks, that has been a huge issue hanging over our company since the day I became CEO. Every time I've met with investors, every time I met with the rating agencies, we have talked about it and it's had the potential to be a tremendous exposure. We found out that, at least on the first case, the arbitration panel ruled against us. And based on that ruling, we were going to be required, under the accounting rules, to book a significant charge around a range of potential outcomes of that settlement. I'll ask Jon Taylor to walk you through the details a little bit, but that number would have had a significant hit to the equity of FirstEnergy, not just FES. And so the decision to settle that for literally a fraction of that potential claim that would have had to be booked I think was a prudent decision for both FirstEnergy Solutions and FirstEnergy, and shouldn't be taken to mean anything but that, that we're trying to get a risk that's affected my decision-making, the FES board's decision-making, how the rating agencies look at our credit, and how you all look at our company off the table and quantifying it for you so you know what it is. That's all we were trying to do there. So, Jon, why don't you just take a minute and walk them through the accounting. K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. So, Angie, as you know, these were long-term contracts we had basically 11 years in dispute. And if you remember, we settled 2012, 2013, and 2014 for about $70 million per year. So, if you do the math, 11 years, $70 million, that's a big number. And that doesn't include escalations, changes in rates, and that type of thing. So the range could have been anywhere from $600 million to about $1 billion of exposure on a net-present-value basis. So, to get this settlement in place, if you take the after-tax impact of what could have been $600 million to the $164 million, you're preserving $300 million or so of equity. And that's just based on where we thought it might settle out based on discussions with counsel and those types of things. I mean, if it would have settled out on the high end, I mean you're looking at $600 million of equity that's preserved. So it was something that we thought was the right thing to do. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: And even if the FES board had decided to file to avoid the $109 million payments, that impact would have still occurred on the FirstEnergy books. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And so the last question, so assuming that nothing comes out from the other DOE study but Ohio does come in and support nuclear plants, what happens with the coal plants within FES? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, let me give a range of outcomes I guess. If let's just say nothing happens out of the DOE study, they say everything's (27:00) fine, we're really not that concerned about these baseload assets closing anymore and they move forward. And then let's say Ohio decides they don't want to move forward. I would tell you it's pretty clear, there's only one other alternative left for the FES board to consider at least from the way I see it. Should Ohio move forward with approving the ZEN at its current rate and the plants run very reliably, that's worth about $300 million a year that would flow to those two nuclear units. That amount in and of itself I don't think is enough to necessarily avoid an FES bankruptcy either. It would be enough potentially for those assets to emerge from bankruptcy and for a reputable nuclear operator be willing to take them on and run them forward. And that is why the ZEN argument is most critical is to make sure those assets are available to the State of Ohio. And the attributes that they bring in addition to 4,300 jobs that support them, the environmental attributes, the fuel security attributes, and so forth. That's the basis of the legislation. I just want to say, again, we have not made any change in our strategy to exit this commodity-exposed generation business and become a fully regulated company. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. It's Jerimiah Booream. That was a great explanation on the $109 million there. Just wanted to be sure, crystal clear, are there any future obligations that could be guaranteed at the FE level associated with FES at this point that we know of? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: There's the $500 million credit line that, as I mentioned, FES has not drawn down on at all. And beyond that, we've talked about the nuclear support agreement. But as long as they still have the $500 million credit facility, they don't need the nuclear support agreement at this time. So, as of now, nothing that I know of is being contemplated. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Makes sense. And then just a little bit longer-term. At what point should we expect a strategic update on kind of 2019-plus prospects more structurally going forward thinking about the company? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we've got a lot to figure out over the next 6 to 12 months that I think is going to have an impact on that. So I would say let us get through this transition period and then we'll talk to you about what the company looks like after that when we're done. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Just two questions. First, can you talk about the EBITDA guidance increase at the competitive business for 2018 and then about the other coal transportation contract you're in discussions around and whether you took an impairment related to that? K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Greg. It's Jon Taylor. So the 2018 EBITDA increased about $35 million to $40 million. Most of that is just around the fuel rate. We saw $1 lower fuel rate as we worked through 2018. A lot of it's coming from just what nuclear fuel we're going to burn, timing of outages and that type of thing. So it's really just around nuclear fuel and other fuel costs. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: And your second question is, in our 10-Q, we did state that we are booking $164 million total for rail settlement. We're in active discussions with BNSF and NS on the second contract. But, as you know, the second contract hasn't been litigated yet even in front of the arbitration panel. But I think, as I said, they're active discussions and we wouldn't have booked that amount if we didn't have some feel of certainty that we can get it done in that range. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kiani with Cove Key Management. Please proceed with your question. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, John. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Chuck, I have a few questions here. Could you remind me of the history behind the DMR? I guess, it was originally a PPA for FES and what happened? And how it now became the $600 million DMR that we're benefiting from today, please? Thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: John, it's going to take the rest of this call for me to give you (32:47) John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Just high level, what the history was behind that? And how it was originally a PPA and then became this? So, just quickly. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. So, obviously we filed an Energy Security Plan that included a PPA as part of it. That was approved 5-0 votes by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission I believe on February 28 of last year. And then was reviewed by FERC. And about seven weeks later, FERC determined that the waiver that we used for that PPA was not valid. And we went back to the commission in Ohio with an alternative plan. And they came back with the DMR, which is worth $200 million a year for sure three years and up to five years. And the rest of the ESP that we filed was basically approved and stayed in effect. The only thing that changed was the PPA got replaced with the DMR. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : So the way to think about it is that originally the benefit through the PPA would have accrued to FES. And then as it evolved, it became the DMR where that $600 million benefit accrues to the regulated utilities instead of FES. Is that the right way to think about it? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Correct. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Got it. Okay. My next question, please, is have you spoken with the NRC about the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust at FES? And obviously you're working hard to get a ZEN in Ohio and there's some effort going on in Pennsylvania as well. But in the event that you're not able to get that for those assets and, hypothetically, if those assets then are shut in a bankruptcy or some type of restructuring or whatnot, who's going to be on the hook for the liability at the NDT? Because obviously it's fully funded today, but those assets have to be shut early, would flip from being funded to being under-funded by a substantial amount based on our estimates. So have you spoken with the NRC? And what are their thoughts, if you have, and your thoughts around an insolvent entity being the guarantor of such a liability, please? Thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, no, I have not spoken to the NRC. But Sam Belcher, our Chief Nuclear Officer, has been in contact with the NRC and have had very transparent discussions with them about everything going on with regard to our competitive affiliate. With regards, specifically, to the new Nuclear Decommissioning Trust, if the event arose that these units would be shut down immediately and needed to be placed in safe storage, there would likely be somewhere around $120 million shortfall in the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust. The liability for that would be under the competitive affiliate. Now, how that would ultimately then be adjudicated, I can't speak to that, but it would be about a $120 million shortfall. And that's what would be needed to allow the fuel to decay enough that it could be put in safe, permanent storage. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Would you as the parent consider guaranteeing that in the event that FES is insolvent and can't cover that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I do not see that as the responsibility of the parent. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : I see. Okay. And then the last question is, have you all evaluated, and are you confident \u2013 have you evaluated the potential for \u2013 if all your hard effort and work doesn't result in what you need for FES and if there is a restructuring at some point, have you all evaluated the risk of veil piercing or subcon at the parent company? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we obviously, as I said, have a legal team, restructuring team, financial advisory team working on the FirstEnergy side of this transaction that is evaluating all those potentials. We are not going to discuss what that evaluation might show or even a range of outcomes of what it might show. But clearly that's a big piece of what we're trying to understand on the FirstEnergy side of things. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Got it. So veil piercing or subcon are just difficult, complicated, obviously, things for you to figure out, so you just don't know yet? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No. We think they're very simple and there shouldn't be any. John Kiani - Cove Key Management : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Let's just assume that the DOE is going to find that coal and nuclear plants are important base of resources. I mean, FERC has pretty much already found that. You could say that the capacity performance products approval was based on this. I mean, we've certainly heard them verbally talk about it. I guess what I'm wondering is let's just assume that the DOE study says these are important assets and we don't want them to close. How should we think about the federal government acting, assuming such a study finding? What would actually \u2013 how should we think about that actually \u2013 what they might actually do considering we've already sort of heard this from the federal government before? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, Paul, as I said, I'm not going to try to predict what might happen at the end of this study, but there is a lot of discussion going on in a lot of fronts with regard to what's happening in our country with fuel-secure baseload assets. And it's clear to me, may not be clear to everybody, but it is clear to me that capacity performance hasn't solved this problem. Our competitive affiliate is on the verge of bankruptcy. It's got 8,000 megawatts of fuel-secure assets in PJM that are not getting paid enough money to keep them open. So I don't think it's working. FERC held a technical conference. They're starting to understand that maybe that it's not working. I think even PJM is now talking about the impact on the resiliency of the grid of these assets closing. And so I think there's a lot of concern being developed. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Chuck, I completely agree. I'm not saying that it's working. I guess what I'm wondering is whether or not they'd actually take steps to come to the conclusion that maybe something other than another form of capacity performance or whatever I mean, in other words, should we think about them basically going down the same sort of like market-based approach, which simply hasn't worked, or is there something else in which they \u2013 something more direct and effective might happen than some sort of additional stakeholder process for them to figure out some sort of market-based mechanism to fix it? Do you see what I'm sort of thinking here? I mean we've sort of been down this road where they say there's an issue, they're going to come up with a solution, and the solution doesn't work. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I think that what they do if they decide there's a problem here that they need to fix has to be fast, it has to be clear, and it has to be transparent to those asset owners that it's going to be secure enough for them to keep those assets running. And how they do that? I can't tell you how they're going to do that. We are obviously working fast and furious inside FirstEnergy to develop our own ideas as to how that could happen that hopefully we'll get a chance to inject into the process at some point in time. I know that our industry group, EEI, is also working to see how they can get involved in this issue. But the real issue for me is I've gotten into it and that you have to read between the lines a little bit. But the Secretary has been very outspoken about the national security implications of allowing these fuel-secure assets to continue to close. And that's a big concern for me too, because we are moving to a place where the bulk electric system in our country, which is tremendously redundant, very sophisticated, is being placed on top of a bulk gas transmission network that is not robust, does not have redundancy, is congested. And any exposure to that bulk gas system then will expose the electric system also. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Fair enough. And just quickly, on the FENOC guarantee, you mentioned that you don't see in the near-term parental support. Can you give us just a little more color as to how the parent guarantee for FENOC might be employed? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, FENOC's operating license with the NRC requires them to at all times have enough liquidity to ensure that in the event that all four of those reactors were to have an issue and need to be placed in safe storage, that they have enough liquidity to do that. That was the whole point behind the nuclear support agreement. As long as they are in the money pool and they have this $500 million secure credit facility that is undrawn, there's no reason for a nuclear support agreement to be in place. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : But if there was no nuclear \u2013 if nothing works on the state level or the federal level, what have you, and FES goes into Chapter 11 or whatever, should we think of that FENOC money as basically being potentially an avenue for creditors to get money? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I would think not. I mean, that nuclear support agreement has \u2013 we would not agree to a nuclear support agreement that was there for any purpose but what it's intended to be, provide the liquidity in the event that all four units have issues that force them to have to be put in safe storage on an emergency basis. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I see. So economic retirement would not be one of them? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Chuck. Just on the decision to settle the rail case, you mentioned the scenario where if you hadn't settled, you would have had to take this potentially large write-off at FE, which I assume would have been non-cash. Is there a reason that that would have mattered if it was non-cash? Would it have been like a covenant issue or rating agency issue? Because it would seem like, otherwise, I'm not sure why that would have been a concern. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Steve. This is Jim. It would not have tripped any covenant. It probably would have impacted our covenant by about 2%. But, ultimately, it could have been a cash issue, depending on what the arbiters decided. In fact, there's scenarios where the decision could have made a payment demanded in full this year. So, from our standpoint, a settlement that is in the $50 million range on a cash basis each year for three years and not having to record that large equity hit, we thought that was the prudent thing to do. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Does that mean... James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think that \u2013 go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : It makes sense on the surface if you look at the cost to settle versus that potential liability. I guess, the one thing I wonder though is to the degree that FES is clearly separate and distinct from FE, that's really an FES cost, not an FE cost. So I guess my question would be why would FE commit the money to settle, if it's really an FES cost? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Again, the railroads wouldn't settle without it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay. And then just on the kind of comment you made about wanting to get through the DOE and Ohio potential legislation that the FES board also wanted to kind of see this play out, can you just maybe end that sentence by saying, like, play out before what? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I'm just going to be very direct here. I think there was an assumption made that we created this separate governance for FES with a sole purpose of moving towards bankruptcy. That is not why we did it. We did it with the understanding that a bankruptcy or restructuring may at some point become inevitable. That FES board is sitting there looking at a whole lot of things but I think, clearly, if there is something in the near-term that can make the picture for creditors better, it's prudent for them to look at that too. We didn't go into this with the idea of figuring out how to not pay creditors back what they loaned us in good faith. And I sit here doing the same thing. I look out for all of you as investors. I'm looking out for our employees and communities, but also sitting here saying if there's a way that we can do better by these creditors, I get paid to do that as a CEO, too. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : That makes sense. Yeah. One last question, just going back to the utilities. Just if we go back to the utility plan that you laid out at EEI, is everything pretty much on track with what you laid out there? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think we're right on track. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Before we take our next question, there are several callers in the queue. In order to address all callers, we ask that you please limit to one question per caller. Thank you. Our next question comes from Dylan Campbell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Morning. Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.: For the inter-company credit facility between FE Corp. and FES, does the arbitration settlement trigger an event of default? We're just looking at the $50 million limit spelled out in your December 8-K filing. Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.: Dylan, it's Steve. It does not. Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And then on your regulated business in New Jersey, do you anticipate filing to get infrastructure trackers and to facilitate more investment and energy efficiency in solar? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I wouldn't say anticipate. I think the outcome of our rig case last year in New Jersey, I think, puts us in a position to have that type of dialogue with the BPU, and we intend to have that dialogue with the BPU about their appetite for an investment program for New Jersey that will drive improved service and reliability for customers. And we'll see if we can do that. But I don't think anticipate would be the right way to say it. We plan to have those discussions. Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Two quick items; one is since now FES is going to wait for the DOE, does that maybe lessen the urgency in the Ohio legislature to get a ZEN approved? Because wouldn't it benefit the Ohio legislature to wait also for the DOE? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I don't think it should lessen any urgency on the part of the Ohio legislature. The whole point of the ZEN is you have two very important assets in Ohio that you need to protect for your state. If they're going to sit around and wait for the federal government, I'm not sure that's prudent on their part. The bills have been introduced. The hearings have started. I think they need to move forward with that. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : And just last, I think Beaver Valley, one of the units was previously owned by one of the Ohio utilities or took the output. Does the ZEN cover Beaver Valley or some of the output from Beaver Valley? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: The ZEN does not limit it to Ohio assets. Assets from outside of Ohio are eligible to apply, and then it would ultimately be, if the legislation's approved the way it is, up to the Public Utilities Commission as to whether or not they qualify. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks, guys. I don't mean to beat a dead horse and come back to Steve's question, but it troubles me a little that what would have been an executory contract that could have become an unsecured claim and a bankruptcy filing is now being guaranteed by the FE parent because that's incremental liability for the equity holder of FE. And how much more of that is going to happen as we think about the time vector between now and when a decision on bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy is made, which really goes also to the question John Kiani asked in that, like, what other hidden liabilities are going to move up to the parent balance sheet as we move through time here before we get to a decision point where you say we're not going to guarantee any more of these liabilities? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, Greg, as we were contemplating whether or not to do this parental guarantee, I completely understood that some of you were going to like it and some of you weren't. But that's pretty much what goes along with every single decision that I've made as CEO since I took this job. I thought it was the right thing to do for FirstEnergy to move forward with this and offer that guarantee. I said earlier, I don't know of anything else that's of this magnitude for sure or anything else at all that would require us to provide further support to our competitive business. It's free cash flow neutral throughout the rest of this year, doesn't need any support. And essentially, since the day I became CEO, we really have provided nothing to support that business. It's been running on its own and, conversely, when we initiated the CFIP program, much of the improvement in cash flow for this company came from that business and put them in that position where they didn't need any parental support. Now, we talked about the fact we've got a second contract that's not yet settled but, as I said, we booked $164 million total for the combination of both contracts. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. I appreciate the answer. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Christina Ren with Capital Group. Please proceed with your question. Christina (Ren) Van Het Hoen - Capital Group : Hi. Good morning. I just have a question about the $109 million settlement payments. Is that going to be paid in an equal installment over the three years? And then I know it says there agreed in principle. When will this be, I guess, finalized and what's the risk of it not being finalized? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I wouldn't say it's going to be paid in equal installments, but essentially equal installments. There was some rounding to make it simpler. All three parties have signed a term sheet. So it's a matter of getting a definitive agreement in place. But I don't see any risk to that happening. It just takes a little bit longer to do that. But all three parties have signed the term sheet. Christina (Ren) Van Het Hoen - Capital Group : Okay. Thank you. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey. This is Jim. I want to say we have a hard stop at 11 o'clock and there's still a number of people on the call. So, if we don't get to you, the IR team will reach out to you to get your questions taken care of. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, John. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sort of slightly different topic but also on FES. We noticed in the 2018 drivers that you're talking about nuclear fuel costs of $5 a megawatt hour and I think last quarter you were showing those as $7. What would account for what seemed like quite a big change? K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Jonathan, It's Jon. It just was the timing of when some of the lower cost nuclear fuel was going to be burned. Previously, we thought it was going to be burned 2019 and beyond. But given some of the outages and the like, some of that will be burned in the second half of 2018. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So there's a fuel inventory and timing of burn kind of thing. K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's right. That's right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And may I just, Chuck, one quick thing on timing. When you committed to 18 months, you didn't know that we were going to have this DOE study and other things that the FES board now wants to wait for. So how do we reconcile that? Or is it \u2013 and how do you feel about that overall timing issue, given now some of these what look like delays? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I need to clarify the difference between a goal and a commitment. Because what I've said is it's our goal to exit by middle of next year. I would never make a commitment because as we began down this path, all of the decisions to complete this exit from commodity-exposed generation are not in my control. But that remains the goal. And as I said earlier, I'm not sure the DOE study itself is going to take that off track. Now if the DOE study says, hey, we're going to do something and make these assets stay around, then I think we need to wait to see what that solution is before we make any final decision. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like you are endorsing the idea that achieving that goal might be slightly less likely. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I'm not endorsing that. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: If the DOE study does what I believe it should do, then we will take a pause and see how that evaluates. But I'm not sure they're going to agree with me, but I clearly believe we are making a mistake as a country if we continue to let these fuel-secure assets close as rapidly as they are, both nuclear and fossil. And that's why the states are having to step up to solve this problem because the markets are not taking care of it. They don't reward the security and a lot of the other attributes that these assets bring. So we need to get this fixed as a country. And I applaud the Trump administration and Secretary Perry for getting this process going. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Morning, everyone. Looking at the DMR, I think stuff may have indicated that essentially to support the parent balance sheet and the overall utility balance sheet, it's a transfer of value from rate payers. How do you view the potential for $300 million in ZEN payments that the rate payers would take on? And what type of value are they receiving? Is there a implied value that you guys have estimated from keeping the nuclear plants open? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, that's up to the legislature to determine. The value is 4,300 jobs. The value is fuel security. The value is the zero-emissions environmental attributes that these assets bring. The value is the tax base that it brings to Ohio. The value is $510 million a year of impact on Ohio's gross domestic product that these plants bring. And Brattle just did a study that would indicate that it will also save customers $1.3 billion in their electric rates over the next 10 years if these assets are there versus if these assets are gone. So, that's the value that they have to quantify. The legislation has a cap of about a $5 increase on customer bills. So, that's the decision that the legislature's going to have to make. Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the time. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Well, we're at the end of our time and, as Jim said, there's a couple more in the queue. Feel free to call Irene and her team, or they'll reach out to you. We'll make sure we get your questions answered. And a lot going on and hopefully we provided some clarity around our recent decisions. If you don't have all the clarity you need, follow up with Irene. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

Now, I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Meghan. Good morning everyone. Yesterday we reported solid second quarter results, including operating earnings that were slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance, despite the impact of mild temperatures on our distribution business. These results reflect strong operational performance and financial discipline across each of our businesses and I'm proud of our entire team. In fact, their efforts have now led to eight straight quarters of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of the operating earnings guidance we provided to investors. While Jim will provide more detail, our stronger second quarter results primarily reflect the impact of new rates that went into effect early this year in eight of our utilities and higher transmission earnings related to our Energizing the Future program. Clearly, the groundwork and investments we are making in our regulated businesses over the last several years are paying off. Now I'll spend a few minutes talking about our regulated businesses and provide an update on our efforts to exit commodity-exposed generation. Then we'll turn the call over to Jim for a more thorough review of our financial results. Let's start with our transmission business. As we announced last quarter, in March, FERC accepted the formula transmission rates for both JCP&L and our Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary known as MAIT. These rates went into effect on June 1 and July 1, respectively, subject to refund pending the outcome of the hearing and settlement procedures. With MAIT in place, we are planning more than $600 million in transmission projects through 2018 that are designed to enhance service reliability for our customers in the Penelec and Met-Ed service territories. This includes more than 330 projects to modernize or replace transmission lines, incorporate new, smart technology into the grid, and outfit dozens of electric substations with new equipment, digital communications and enhanced security features. In addition to the many small projects, this effort includes a $64 million upgrade to an existing 25-mile 230-kV line in our Penelec territory in north-central Pennsylvania and a $40 million rebuild of an existing 20 million (sic) 20-mile (4:31), 115-kV transmission line in Bradford County, Pennsylvania. As you'll recall, the majority of our initial investment in Energizing the Future was focused in ATSI, which covers our Ohio and part of our western Pennsylvania service territories. Now we are pleased to expand these grid modernization and reliability investments to the east. Turning to our distribution business. As I mentioned, quarter-over-quarter results improved due to new rates that went into effect in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in January. These helped to offset the impact of a very temperate spring, which included the mildest April temperatures we have ever recorded. In the industrial class, we experienced our fourth consecutive quarter of load growth, driven largely by the shale gas, steel, coal mining and chemical industries. The mild weather we have experienced across our system during the first half of the year had an $0.08 per share unfavorable impact versus the normal weather that is assumed in our operating earnings guidance. However, based on the trends we are seeing, we believe the full year load growth is likely to be slightly better than our initial forecast. If this plays out, we expect the load improvements in the second half of 2017 to offset the impact of mild temperatures in the first half of the year. We are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our distribution business and pleased with the continued progress of our Energizing the Future initiative. Together, we believe these regulated growth strategies are positioning our company for sustained customer service-oriented growth. I don't want to skip over the results for our competitive business. Again, Jim will provide more detail, but I want to congratulate the teams at Perry and Beaver Valley Unit 2, which both had extremely successful refueling outages. Both units had 29-day outages and for Perry, it was the shortest in the plant's history. We are pleased to see the strong operational performance from these important assets. Staying with the competitive business, I will also note that FES achieved an uptick in direct retail sales this quarter, resulting from the acquisition of several new large commercial and industrial customers in Ohio. The addition of these new customers is in line with FES' retail sales plan, which focuses on conservatively hedging its expected generation, while managing potential cash collateral needs. Despite conservative operations, this remains a volatile business and we continue working to exit commodity-exposed generation. So, let's switch gears and review our efforts towards that objective. We've made a lot of progress since we announced our strategic review of this business back in November. From the beginning, we have been focused on seeking solutions that are in the best interest of all constituents, including shareholders, creditors, employees, customers, and the communities where these plants are located. First, we continue to make progress on our negotiations for the sale of gas and hydro assets owned by Allegheny Energy Supply. As you'll recall, we entered into an agreement for the sale in January. In June, FERC granted approval of the transaction. However, the terms of the agreement have continued to evolve. The parties are exploring alternative structures in terms of pricing and closing. Based on current discussions and reflecting the impact of prevailing market conditions, CES recorded a $0.19 per share non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter. We are targeting to close the transaction with revised terms in the second half of the year. In West Virginia, our Mon Power utility is working through the regulatory process to complete the purchase of Allegheny Energy Supply's 1,300-megawatt Pleasants plant. We responded to our recent FERC request for additional information, and we expect final approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC by early 2018. When these two transactions are complete and we pay off all remaining long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply, including make-whole payments, we expect to realize approximately $350 million in net proceeds. Let's turn now to a review of FES, where we also continue to make progress on other significant outstanding issues. In April, we discussed the settlement with CSX and BNSF on a coal transportation dispute. We remain engaged in settlement efforts with BNSF and Norfolk Southern on a second coal transportation dispute. The arbitration panel has declined the railroad's request to resolve certain issues before discovery and has set a trial date for June of 2018. We remain optimistic that a settlement can be reached. In addition, FirstEnergy and FES each have a fully engaged team of financial and legal advisers to ensure that both entities are well prepared, as FirstEnergy exits the commodity-exposed generation business. And in a recent development, we are scheduled to have discussions with FES creditors next week. Finally, we are closely monitoring the status of initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Over the last few months, more than 6,500 Ohio community leaders, citizens and businesses have voiced their support of the Zero-Emission Nuclear resource program, or ZEN. As we discussed during our last call, legislation was introduced in the Ohio House and Senate in April, which would help keep nuclear assets as a part of Ohio's generation mix. Similar to programs in New York and Illinois, the bills call for recognizing the critical energy security and environmental attributes of nuclear power in Ohio. In addition to engaging our communities, we recently held a virtual town hall to educate more than 100 legislators and key stakeholders on the potential benefits of this program, which would support Ohio jobs, economic growth and reliable and affordable generation, and environmental progress for many years to come. We will continue these efforts once legislators return from summer recess. At the federal level, we are looking forward to the release of the Department of Energy's study that was initiated by the Trump administration and U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in April. The study is expected to address economic and security risks associated with the premature closure of the nation's fuel-secure base load generation as a result of regulations, subsidies and tax policies, as well as how well markets are addressing the inherent benefits of existing fuel-secure base load assets. We're optimistic that the final DOE study will be released soon and could offer solutions to address this national concern. And the FES board is closely following this effort, which is expected to help them determine the right path forward for FES. For now, FES continues to have access to the unregulated money pool. As of June 30, FES, its subsidiaries, and FENOC had net borrowings of $174 million from the money pool, primarily reflecting the satisfaction of the June 1 bond maturity, lease and interest payments, as well as the initial installment on the coal transportation settlement. Our current expectation is that they will have no borrowings by March 2018, even after funding capital expenditures and nuclear fuel. Last night, we updated full year 2017 GAAP earnings estimate to $1.95 to $2.25 per share, primarily to reflect the additional asset impairment charges related to the pending sale of the gas and hydro units. We also reaffirmed our operating earnings guidance of $2.70 to $3 per share, and provided third and fourth quarter guidance ranges. Again, I am pleased with our progress on both our regulated growth initiatives and the significant progress we have made over a very short period to exit commodity-exposed generation in a timely, yet thoughtful manner. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As Chuck said, we reported solid second quarter results that were slightly better than the midpoint of our operating earnings guidance, with another very strong quarter with respect to operational performance across the company. Our GAAP results of $0.39 per share include an impairment charge of $0.19 per share related to the current discussions with the buyer for the Allegheny Energy Supply asset sale, which Chuck discussed earlier. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share in the quarter. As I walk through each segment, I'll remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our website. In our distribution business, new Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania rates that went into effect in January raised second quarter earnings by $0.20 per share. Weather was extremely mild across our service area with heating degree days 30% lower than the same period of 2016 and 24% below normal. This drove a 0.7% decrease in total distribution deliveries, with sales to residential customers decreasing 4.6% and commercial deliveries down 1.5%. We have now marked four consecutive quarters of growth in the industrial sector, and on a weather-adjusted basis, total distribution deliveries across all segments increased 1% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. We are hopeful that these positive trends will continue as the economy improves in our footprint. In our transmission business, second quarter earnings benefited from higher revenues resulting from our continued investment in the Energizing the Future program. At corporate, our second quarter results also reflect higher interest cost and impact of the effective income tax rate. Turning to the competitive business, commodity margin continues to reflect the lower capacity revenues related to the weaker prices that went into effect last June, as well as the expected decrease in retail sales, which were down 2.2 million megawatt hours. This was partially offset by lower depreciation expense related to the asset impairments recorded last year. Consistent with our expectations, the total retail customer count is now about 850,000, which is down from 1.5 million a year ago. We are reaffirming 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $405 million to $475 million for the competitive business and currently expect to come in at the high end of that range. We have also increased the 2018 adjusted EBITDA range to $140 million to $260 million, from $130 million to $250 million, reflecting additional committed contract sales. Before I move to questions, I want to add a note about how pleased we were with our $3 billion debt offering in June. This transaction eliminated a new near-term debt maturity by refinancing FirstEnergy Corp.'s $650 million bond expiring March of 2018 with the remainder reducing FirstEnergy Corp.'s revolver borrowings, resulting in stronger corporate liquidity and reducing our exposure to rising interest rates. This was the largest non-M&A debt deal in the history of the utility industry. Frankly, we were overwhelmed by investor interest. At one point, we understand the order book was over $15 billion. We thank you for your interest and your support. Again, we are pleased with the performance across our company and the strong results of the first half of the year. We are fully focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our regulated growth strategy. Now let's take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Chuck. So, the interesting new wrinkle here is your first meeting with creditors at FES, which I think you said today, you have had no discussions. So, maybe you could give a little more color on why that meeting is happening now and who instigated it, and just why now, why not before, why not later? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I can't provide a lot of color, but I think I can say this, Steve, that I think we always knew that somewhere along the line, this engagement with creditors was going to happen. I think the color about why now is, I think it, number one, I think took the creditors to get organized around what they might want to approach with, and our FES team got a call from a group that, at least, preliminarily says they represent more than 80% of the creditors, and they outlined a formula for a potential discussion that was interesting enough that FES decided it was worth pursuing. I will be engaged in that discussion because, obviously, the creditors are interested in talking about what FirstEnergy might be willing to do to get this settled also. So, beyond that, I think we always knew this was going to happen at some point in time. I think it is clearly the preferred route if we end up in a bankruptcy proceeding with FES to do it through a structured settlement that all parties are comfortable with. So, we need to \u2013 we just need to start those discussions and see them through to the end and see what comes out of them. And beyond that, I think it's pretty clear, we're not going to negotiate with creditors in the public venue, so the types of things we're talking about, they're going to morph and we'll just have to communicate it at the end when we know the results. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just on the DOE, do you have any update on timing of when you expect that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I was just down in Washington the last two days and I heard a joke and the joke that I heard was, when you \u2013 what do you call a federal study that's supposed to take 60 days that takes 120 days? And the answer is, early. So, I think I can tell you this, the people inside the Department of Energy are taking this mission very seriously. They got reams of data submitted to them, reams of studies submitted to them. They are working through all that. I am confident that they are doing it as diligently as possible. I think the Secretary's assignment to do this within 60 days was very ambitious given the complexity of these issues. But having said that, I think they're probably getting close to wrapping it up, and I would expect \u2013 I expect something probably in the next couple weeks to come out of there. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then one last question, the utility net of parent guidance that you have given for the company, I know it goes back, I think, to EEI for the next several \u2013 for several years. Obviously, not refreshing the whole thing, but just overall, is that still kind of the ballpark view for the utility net of parent, excluding it? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. I don't think that's changed at all, Steve, from what we gave you there. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: All right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just to follow up on Steve's question with respect to the discussions with creditors, is this a process that you would \u2013 I guess, I'm thinking about that in relationship to a potential Chapter 11 filing. Is that a dialogue you'd like to sort of play out before you would consider a formal Chapter 11 filing, or is it \u2013 how would the two sort of interplay with each other? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, as I said earlier, I think we always knew that there would come a point in time where we would be having these discussions with creditors. I think it would be in everybody's best interest if we can come up with a mutually agreeable way to deal with the issues that exist at FES. It's far too early to speculate as to whether we're going to be able to do that or not. But I can tell you this, the discussion they had with FES was intriguing enough that we're willing to sit down and talk about it and we just have to let it play out. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Totally understood, okay. And then just on the DOE study, I think a lot of people feel that the most likely outcome there is for DOE to direct or request that FERC look at potential approaches to reforming the market to provide an arguable improvement in payments to base load generation. Is that a \u2013 how valuable, I guess, from your perspective do you see that in terms of your assessment of whether or not FES is insolvent? In other words, that would really kick off probably a very long process with a very uncertain outcome. Is that sufficient to sort of sway your take as to whether FES is insolvent, given that DOE itself doesn't really likely have a direct authority to make these payments? How do you feel about sort of the involvement of FERC in the process? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, let me clear up a couple of things. May have left an impression on the last call that we're waiting on this in some fashion. We are moving forward with everything that needs to be done to exit the commodity-exposed generation business in a prudent, thoughtful manner. And now, the next step in that process is engaging with the FES creditors to see if there's a way to expedite that process and obviously if we can, that will probably be the most expeditious way to get out of that business. I continue to think, though, it's prudent for us to see what the DOE says and where they might go, and how serious of a problem they think this is. I mean \u2013 and it could range from them saying the markets are fine and everything's working great to \u2013 we have a very serious national security, fuel diversity, fuel security issue and we need to do something immediately. I don't know where it's going to come out and I'm not going to speculate about how the FES board will react depending on what that is. So, that's the other point I want to make. The decision to move forward with FES, one of the things we needed to do was create that separation. We have an independent board and an independent group of officers that are now making the decisions for FES. I am not making those decisions anymore. And they will evaluate what comes out of the DOE study, in the context of where they're at with this entire process to exit and they will be the ones that decide. But it can be such a wide range, we're within a couple weeks. When we know what we know, then I think that's when we're in a position to comment about what they said and what they think the future might look like. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very clear. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Thank you. Just to sort of follow up on the DOE, just \u2013 we've already seen some efforts on the part of FERC to sort of help out base load generation. Clearly, there has been identification of it. They've had a technical conference. I'm just wondering, what specifically do you envision, I guess, the DOE study doing practically to sort of change the trajectory at FERC or to speed it up or what have you? Do you follow what I'm saying? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, maybe the best way to answer that is, I've spent a lot of time down in D.C. talking to everybody that will listen to me, so why don't I just tell you what I've been telling everybody. I've been telling everybody, I think our country is heading for a disaster, okay? The disaster could take a number of different forms. One disaster could be a national security type of issue. We are taking the most sophisticated bulk electric system that exists anywhere in this world and putting it on top of a bulk gas system that is very unsophisticated and that sets up security risks if there were ever an attack on that bulk gas system, it does not have the redundancy that the bulk electric system has. Since the blackout in 2003 under NERC's guidance, we have built extreme redundancy into how we operate that bulk electric system. None of that matters if the gas quits flowing, and we are reducing the amount of fuel-secure base load generation we have to keep the lights on in the event of that type of an event. Second, I think we could be heading for an economic disaster. We are getting to where we are relying too much on one fuel source for the generation of electricity, and I think fuel diversity is critical to keeping economic stability. With where gas is priced now, if anything happens to cause that gas price to go up again and create a volatility in the gas markets, the volatility in electric markets is going to be so great that I don't think industry in our country is going to be able to tolerate it. So, there's an economic crisis that we're facing. And when these assets close, they close forever. They do not get reopened. So, that is why the State of New York stepped in and said, we need to do something to take care of our assets. That's why the State of Illinois stepped in and said, we need to do something. Ohio is looking at it, Connecticut is looking at it, New Jersey is looking at it, and I tell them, the federal government created this problem. It's up to the federal government to fix this problem. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Do you see the federal government taking action in the near-enough term to change the trajectory of FES and the potential for filing Chapter 11? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I just said earlier, I'm not going to speculate on what they're going to say and what they're going to do. I think we're going to know that in the next few weeks and then I'll answer all the questions that I need to answer once I know what we're dealing with. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I mean there's so many different things that could happen and this is kind of the position that I've taken my entire time in this job. I get a lots of speculatory questions and I always say, listen, I'll answer questions once I know the facts. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Fair enough. And then just finally on the $131 million impairment, how should we think about those negotiations and what the ultimate impact financially might be with respect to this most \u2013 or this announced reduction \u2013 this write-off? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. This is Jim. The way I would look at it is, there're ongoing negotiations we're having and I think the adjustment to the purchase price really just reflects the market conditions we're experiencing right now. So, that's the only way I'd look at that, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Do you see that changing at all, or I mean could that \u2013 in other words, if prices rebound that would change, or I mean how should we \u2013 let me ask you this, when do you think negotiations will be completed? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: We think that it will probably be done by third quarter, early fourth quarter, maybe, by the end of this year. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, thanks a lot. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. I'm not sure when it will close, but the discussions should be done by then. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi guys. And I wanted to, unfortunately, spend a little bit more time just on FES, just to understand, from a risk perspective, if ultimately you're looking at it from an FE shareholder perspective, when do you think you'd be able to box the risk around FES in terms of the negotiation with creditors? Firstly, if you could give any ranges around what you think \u2013 what's at stake effectively, and then when do you think you'll have clarity in terms of providing certainty on how this process is going to play out? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, Praful, I said earlier, we're not going to negotiate with FES creditors in public. We have boxed already the risk that we think FES shareholders have to a bankruptcy \u2013 or FirstEnergy shareholders have to a bankruptcy of FES, and that hasn't changed since the last quarter. That's obviously going to be a key ingredient in any negotiations with creditors. So, beyond that, it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate with creditors publicly and \u2013 but we're going to approach those negotiations clearly with an eye towards the impact on FirstEnergy shareholders, both in the short and long term as we move to exit this business. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. And then just so I understand from a timing perspective on the ZEN, if this is all connected, right, in terms of the ZEN and how that fits into FES and the negotiation, if the ZEN takes time to play out, even though it's coming, it may come next year, let's say. How does that then play in terms of your negotiation, and does that extend the timing of how you think this \u2013 the actual process (33:10) plays out? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No, there is no connection in my mind. And if we sit down with creditors next week and strike an agreement in one meeting and file that agreement with a bankruptcy court, I am going to continue to fight for this ZEN legislation because it is the right thing to do for the State of Ohio, it's the right thing to do for those assets. It gives those assets the best chance of running under new owners. I'm not sure those assets will run unless there is something done either federally or by the State of Ohio to ensure that they get a different financial return model, and that's bad. So, we're going to continue to work on ZEN whether or not \u2013 irrespective of what happens with FES. Don't even connect the two. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. So, if you strike a deal and then you get the ZEN later on, is there going to be like a value carve-out or some form of value that flows back to FE shareholders because otherwise that's significant value at that point from the ZEN, which shouldn't all go to the creditors, I'm assuming? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I would think it's unlikely that it's going to deliver enough value to overcome the amount that's going to be owed to creditors in a bankruptcy. So, don't expect any of that to flow to FirstEnergy shareholders. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. All right. Thank you so much. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: But it's going to make these assets saleable by those creditors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Gregg. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Two questions. First, what are you thinking about in terms of the prospects for ZENs in Pennsylvania? And then around the load growth, is there any \u2013 could you talk a little bit about \u2013 a little more about the strength that you're seeing there and what gives you confidence that that's going to kind of carry through the year? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, the prospects for ZEN in Pennsylvania, I don't even feel capable of commenting on yet. The dialogue is early. I think they've got other legislative issues they're wrestling with there, but I view it the same way. We will continue to support that discussion irrespective of where we're at with the exit of FES, and even after the exit of FES, because I think it's the right thing to do. I think the market policies are not working and it \u2013 how can you rationalize in a country like the United States of America that in one part of this country, we're spending billions and billions of dollars to build new nuclear plants, and then in another part of this country we're closing nuclear plants that are already built and have 20 years of useful life. These policies have failed and they need to be fixed and if they aren't going to get fixed by the federal government, then I think the states will continue to step in and fix them. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And on the load growth? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Gregg. What we saw for the first half of this year was that \u2013 or the second quarter year-to-date is that on a weather-adjusted basis, our residential was up about 1%, and our commercial was just up slightly. Our rates and economic team, they've taken a look at that with customer growth and their view on the economy and they think the trend will continue in the second half with residential and commercial continuing the trend upward. From an industrial side, we've had the increase associated with petroleum and shale gas. We are seeing some negative results in the automotive sector, but at this point, I think, we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to see some continued trend upward on residential and commercial. And industrial, we think, will stay fairly strong with the exception of the auto industry. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. I just wanted to understand \u2013 just make sure I'm understanding the sort of government's aspects of what you're saying about engaging creditors and the two entities correctly. It sounded like there's already been discussion among creditors with FES, but now what you're saying is that FE, as in you, are going to sit down with them next week? Am I getting that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. There have been one discussion between the group representing the creditors and FES. And in that discussion, FES reached out to me to ask if we would be willing to sit down and engage in that process, and I clearly said, yes, we would be willing to sit down and engage in that process. And that first meeting's happening very soon. So, that's as much as I can tell you at this point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then, on \u2013 you made this comment that you've boxed the liabilities, and I'd sort of a two-part question on that. Are there other rail-type contracts beyond the two you've talked about? And would it \u2013 would you guys mind just sort of reminding us what these \u2013 what the boxed liabilities are that you've talked about in public just so we kind of got straight on the \u2013 what you've put out there on that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Jim will cover all of what we've given you in the past about the potential exposure to FirstEnergy shareholders directly related to the bankruptcy. On the rail settlement, we disclosed a number in the first quarter of what we thought we would be in the range of to settle both of those contracts. As I said in my remarks, the railroads asked for an expedited process on the second contract that they did not get. So, that's now scheduled for trial next June. I haven't changed and we haven't changed our view on ultimately what we might settle for and we're working to try to still do that. So, those numbers haven't changed. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Those are the \u2013 there are two of these contracts and that's it? Or are there others that we just haven't kind of bubbled up to the surface? Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, there's two minor companion cases, if you would, in federal courts dealing with BN. But at this point, we're very comfortable, they're kind of the same ones. The first one was wrapped up with the first settlement, the second \u2013 if we wrap up the second piece of the settlement, it'll go along with it. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Don't see any other exposure, Jonathan, than what we've communicated. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then if Jim wouldn't mind, just kind of reminding us the list that would be \u2013 that would help us. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Sure, yeah. We have a slide in the appendix of the quarterly highlights, but let me highlight it. We have some unfunded pension, OPEB and some other employee benefits, that's about $855 million. Rail settlements out there is about $72 million. We have these secured surety bonds as well as the secured credit facility, that's about $700 million in total and then we have some other energy contracts and guarantees, they're about $60-some-million. So, that's about $1.7 billion out there, of which $700 million is secured by first mortgage bonds. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much, Jim. Appreciate that. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: No problem, John, yep. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. A couple of questions. One just on the dry cask storage, I have to be honest, I'm not the world's greatest expert on this, how does that \u2013 if a nuclear unit retires early and if you immediately begin the decommissioning or SAFSTOR process, what is it you're exactly required to do that would take about $1 billion of spend to comply, $1 billion though spread over a long, long period of time, it seems like. Like, what's physically actually happening and then what's the process to get reimbursement from DOE? And have we ever seen anybody actually do that? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I'm not much more schooled on it than you, Michael, so \u2013 but simply, if these plants are shut down, there is a process where you're going to remove the fuel from the reactor, you are going to put it into the pool inside the plant. It's going to be there for a while until it decays to the point where it can be safely put in dry cask storage. The process for doing that is a process where FENOC is responsible for as the licensee for those sites for the safe shutdown of those facilities. FENOC would fund that and apply to the Department of Energy for reimbursement and that's about as much as I know. We can get you more details offline if you need them. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Michael, this is Jim. We do have a slide in our appendix that covers some of our nuclear facts, it gives you like some of the NDT funding, but we also have like a dry cask storage overview. So, I think if you go through that, and then if you have any further questions, we would be more than happy to jump on the line with you. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I can follow up offline. My biggest question was really the reimbursement by the DOE. Is there any precedent for that? I can do that offline. I actually want to ask a follow-on question, totally unrelated on the regulated side of the business. And it's really \u2013 when you look \u2013 Chuck, when you look at the cost structure, and I'm thinking non-fuel O&M, how do your utilities compare relative to the companies you would view as your peers? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but when we benchmark our T&D O&M expenses, they benchmark very low across the industry, if that's what you're asking. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That is exactly what I'm asking. Okay. And how about kind of corporate-level costs or A&G-level costs? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Again, I think we benchmark very well. I mean, Michael, we went through six years of cost reduction initiatives across this company and that was in every part of this business. We have worked extremely hard to get as efficient at everything that we do, whether that was in the utility or the generation business, when we launched CFIP, that was several hundred million dollars more of costs that we figured out how to get out of this company. So, from a cost structure, we benchmark very well pretty much across the board now. We have individual pockets where a given corporate area, we've got room to improve and we've identified those and we're working on them. But in general, we're top quartile or top decile, pretty much across the board in all that benchmarking. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, Chuck. Just quickly, do you think an outcome from the DOE, whether it's supportive or not supportive, would help the likelihood of getting a ZEN passed in Ohio? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think there's the potential that depending on what DOE says, it could wake up some of the legislators who aren't necessarily seeing the future concerns. So, I would say, yeah, I mean, it's possible, but we're actively working the ZEN legislation in Ohio and that's our job to go out and one by one convince these legislators that this is good for the state and they should vote for it. And that's what we're doing. If something comes out of the DOE study that we can take to those meetings and use, we're definitely going to use it. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. At what point do you envision putting FES into disc ops? What do you have to cross to do that? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: It would probably be, at the time, if there was a restructuring and we had to deconsolidate FES, it would be at that point in time, it wouldn't be before then. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, just on the core business for FE, the regulated utility. So, you talked about the cost structure, how about the investment structure and your asset \u2013 in your regulated assets and the ways to fund it. We're hearing from Ohio that the strain of your balance sheet has prevented you from investing in some of your distribution assets. We're still waiting for equity to be issued. So, can we talk about how you envision the growth in your core business, largely regardless of what happens with FES? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, yeah, Angie, so what we've talked about is a growth of our T&D business in the range of 4% to 6%. Some of that is going to be choppy because you have to have rate cases to recover those investments. But much of it is through transmission formula rates now, much of it is through a range of different distribution recovery mechanisms, in particular, in Ohio and Pennsylvania. So, we're still looking in that range of 4% to 6% annual growth. That doesn't mean it's going to be that every single year. It means one year might be 8% and the next year might be 2%, and so forth because of just the way some of these things happen. But that hasn't changed. The ability to finance it, I think we've communicated, we're going to be issuing some equity over the next few years and I've answered that question repeatedly since moving into this position now almost three years ago. We got lots of questions about why not issue equity quickly, and my answer was, I think equity is intended for growing the company, not to work your way out of a difficult position financially. I think we worked our way out of that difficult position in the right way by cutting more costs, by getting more efficient in everything that we do and got to a position to where now we have the ability to invest going forward and I have no embarrassment about saying, we're going to use equity for part of that growth. That's what it's intended for. When we look at transmission, in particular, because we're now four years and $4.2 billion into that, it's getting to a point where it funds a lot of that itself. So, I think we're poised to move forward, we're sticking to the 4% to 6% growth rate for now. When we're done with this exit of commodity-exposed generation, then we'll talk about it at that point in time to see where we're at. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I'm just asking because you said that you guys didn't benchmark yourself against lot of T&D operations on the cost perspective, but if you just look at your rate base per customer, I know it's a simplistic measure, it does seem like your distribution businesses are under-invested versus those of your peers in the same states, which, I mean, could be a function of the level of funding that you have available. So, I'm not trying to say to issue more equity to shore up the balance sheet, but maybe accelerate that distribution growth. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Angie, it's very complicated, but I look at it this way. We're going to spend money on the right things to serve our customers the right way and create the right growth for our shareholders, and that's a complex balance. Across our service territory, in particular, we've had negative or flat load growth now for the last eight years. And when you have that type of an environment, you have to be cautious about how you look at distribution investments because you've got no load growth to pay for it, which means then it's rate increases and it's rate increases across the customer base that we serve that quite frankly, every dollar that they pay in their electric bill is a challenge for many of them. So, we try to balance it all. There is nothing stopping us from doing more, but I also would say this, our reliability to our distribution customers in every state that we serve is near the top. So, we've invested the right way to serve the customers the right way. And as time moves on, what you're outlining is that means we have plenty of opportunity to do that going forward. On the O&M side, we focus real heavily on O&M because in the customers' bill, they pay that back to us dollar for dollar. So, the fact that we've reduced our O&M over time, and we don't \u2013 and you don't earn anything on it as shareholders, we just get that back. So, we've put ourselves in a position where we're making the right kind of investments, we've been very strategic about it in the right way where we can then move forward state by state and grow not just the utility earnings, but grow the level of service that we're providing to the customers at the same time. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes the line of Chris Melandia (53:29) of Wellington Management. Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Hi, Chuck. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Chris (53:38), how you're doing? Unknown Speaker : I wanted to see how you're thinking about the company's credit quality and rating as you enter these negotiations with the FES creditors. I want to ensure or get a feel that this is of high importance as you enter those negotiations? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: It is of high importance and we have worked very hard to make progress there, and I don't intend to give it up. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: All right, well, thank you all for attending the call and for your questions. Look forward to answering more going forward as we get more information. Obviously, everybody is interested in this DOE study as are we. So, we'll know more about that in the coming weeks and then we'll talk about it later. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful rest of your day.",

Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's third quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with a PowerPoint presentation, which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we reported very strong third quarter results. Our GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share. Our operating earnings of $0.97 per share not only exceeded the third quarter of 2016, but also surpassed our guidance range. This was possible in part, thanks to another very solid quarter in the regulated business, as well as stronger-than-expected results in our Competitive and Corporate segments. Above all, it reflects our teams' laser focus on costs, cash and operational performance and our track record of execution. I'm pleased to note that we are now closing in on three straight years of exceeding or meeting the midpoint of operating earnings guidance we provided to investors. As always, Jim will provide more details on our quarterly financial results later in the call. Now, let's move to a discussion of some of the key developments across our company. We'll start with our regulated businesses, where we are building a platform for sustained customer service focused growth. In our transmission business, our Energizing the Future initiative continues to reduce predictable results and we remain on pace with our investments as we expand our grid modernization and reliability work into the eastern part of our service territory. As we have discussed, FERC accepted the formula transmission rates for both our JCP&L transmission assets and our Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary, known as MAIT, in March. These rates went into effect on June 1 and July 1 respectively, subject to refund, pending the outcome of hearing and settlement proceedings. While the JCP&L case remains pending and the MAIT case, we were pleased to file a settlement agreement with FERC earlier this month with a proposed 10.3% return on equity. We expect FERC to rule on this settlement agreement in the next several months. Moving to our distribution business, the narrative for the third quarter follows the themes we discussed during the first half of the year. Results improved compared to the same period in 2016 due to the new rates that went into effect in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in January. Weather had a significant impact year-over-year, while cooling degree days were slightly higher than normal during the third quarter of 2017. The temperatures were far more moderate than we experienced last year, which was the hottest summer in our service area in more than four decades. That tough weather comparison aside, our load trends are a good news story. On a weather-adjusted basis, distribution deliveries to residential and commercial customers continue to come in better than our forecast. And for the year, we remain optimistic that these load improvements will offset the mild temperatures from earlier this year, which is in line with our discussion last quarter. In the industrial class, the third quarter load growth of 1.2% was driven largely by the shale gas, steel and petroleum industries. This continues a positive trend in this segment, where we've now experienced five consecutive quarters of growth. Our teams have been updating our load analysis for 2018 and beyond and we plan to discuss our outlook with you at EEI next week. Before I wrap up the discussion of our utility business, I want to extend my thanks to our employees who traveled south in September to assist with Hurricane Irma. Overall, more than 630 FirstEnergy employees assisted with the restoration effort and they continue to receive notes of thanks from those affected by the storms. This hurricane season was a stark reminder to many of the importance of a reliable and resilient electric grid for customers and our nation's economy. We commend Secretary Perry and the Department of Energy for recognizing this and for taking action to help prevent additional premature closures of U.S. fuel-secure baseload generating assets. As you know, in late September, the Secretary of Energy proposed the adoption of a rule by FERC to correct faulty market conditions and keep essential fuel-secure baseload generating plants operating. We believe this should help ensure customers continue to receive safe, reliable and affordable supplies of electricity, while maintaining the security of the electric grid. And we filed comments in testimony earlier this week, expressing our strong support for the Resiliency Pricing Rule. We were also pleased to see the broad bipartisan support for this measure expressed in both houses of the Pennsylvania legislature earlier this week. At the state level too, we are encouraged to see a renewed effort to preserve essential generation. While the Ohio legislature was on recess this summer, we continued working on a modified approach to help compensate the state's nuclear plants for the fuel diversity, environmental and other benefits that they provide. This month, Representative DeVitis along with 15 bipartisan co-sponsors from across the state introduced House Bill 381 called Ohio Clean Energy Jobs, which essentially reworked the zero emission nuclear proposal. This bill would create a program to help protect the state's nuclear plants and ensure they continue to support well-paid jobs, economic growth, reliable and affordable electricity generation and environmental progress. Proposal caps impact on both residential and non-residential customers and reduces the length of the program to 13 years. While revenue resulting from this legislation will be a reduction from the previous versions, it would likely make the plants economically viable, particularly in a restructuring scenario at FES. We believe this effort is imperative for Ohio's energy security. The Ohio House Public Utilities Committee is expecting to hold hearings on the bill over the next several weeks with a vote possible before year-end. We expect the final vote in the legislature around the middle of the first quarter. Whether these state or federal activities result in meaningful and timely support remains to be seen, but it is encouraging to see the much needed attention on these very important issues. At the federal level, the rule-making provision utilized by Secretary Perry has only been used once before by an Energy Secretary and I believe that underscores how serious the administration is about these concerns. Both FirstEnergy and FES Board will continue to watch these near-term developments with interest. At the same time, FirstEnergy continues our efforts to exit commodity-exposed generation. There have been a number of additional developments on that front since our last call. So, I'll take a few minutes to provide an update on our progress. In late-August, we entered into a revised agreement for the sale of competitive natural gas and hydroelectric generation owned by our Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiary in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Under the terms of the revised agreement, 1,615 megawatts of assets will be sold to LS Power for an all-cash price of $825 million, subject to certain adjustments. As you will recall from our conversation last quarter, we originally entered into an agreement for this sale in January and FERC granted approval of the original transaction in June. The revised agreement includes four natural gas power stations in Pennsylvania, our competitive interest in the Bath County Hydro station and adds our interest in the Buchanan gas facility, both of which are in Virginia. The transaction involving the four natural gas stations in Pennsylvania is expected to close this year, while the sale of the interest in the Bath County and Buchanan facilities is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. One of the closing conditions is that LS Power must reach an agreement with us and the other owner of the Bath County facility with respect to the operations of that plant. We are hopeful that, that process will be completed soon. In West Virginia, Mon Power continues to work through the regulatory process to complete the purchase of Allegheny Energy Supply's 1,300-megawatt Pleasants plant. We continue to expect final approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC by early 2018. Net proceeds to Allegheny Energy Supply from these two transactions are expected to be about $350 million after paying off all remaining long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply, including make-whole premium payments. We expect that the proceeds will be invested in FirstEnergy's unregulated money pool. As we previously mentioned, FirstEnergy and FES each have a fully engaged team of financial and legal advisors who are assisting with our exit from the commodity-exposed generation business. FES held initial discussions with its creditor advisors in early September and the parties have continued their dialogue since then, primarily focused on due diligence and providing an understanding of the FES operations and its financial projections. It is our understanding that the creditor groups that have formed represent a large group of the Bruce Mansfield sale leaseback noteholders as well as the secured and unsecured pollution control notes. FirstEnergy is not currently involved in these discussions, but we would participate when it's appropriate. In a restructuring scenario, a preferred outcome would be agreement with creditors. At this time, FirstEnergy continues to provide FES access to the unregulated money pool. As of the end of September, FES, its subsidiaries and FENOC had net borrowings of $67 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect them to have a neutral to slightly invested position in the unregulated money pool by the end of March 2018. This forecast includes a series of debt service and lease payments totaling $88 million between now and March, $48 million of which is due on December 1. The FES Board has the responsibility of deciding whether FES will seek protection under a Chapter 11 filing and they have several key considerations in making that decision, including the outlook for the DOE's proposed rule and FERC's actions as well as the status of discussions with creditors' advisors. With almost 10 months behind us, 2017 is shaping up to be a positive year for our company, with strong financial and operational performance as well as progress on our regulated initiatives. Last night, we announced that we increased our GAAP forecast for the full year of 2017 to a range of $2.02 to $2.42 per share. This takes into account an estimate of our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. On an operating earnings basis, our utility and transmission businesses are solidly on track to achieve their targets in 2017. With better than expected performance in Corporate and our Competitive business, we are raising our full-year guidance to a range of $3 to $3.10 per share, above the upper end of the previous range. As always, we intend to continue positioning FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth to benefit shareholders, customers and employees. Thank you for your time and I'll now turn the call over to Jim. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the discussion of our results, I'll remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our website. Our strong operational performance and financial discipline across the company are reflected in our third quarter 2017 GAAP results and our operating earnings, which as Chuck said, came in well above our guidance for the quarter. Third quarter earnings in the distribution business increased by $0.05 per share compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was driven by the new rates that went into effect in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in January. Cooling degree days were 3% above normal, but 27% lower than the same period of 2016. This drove a 7% decrease in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2016, with sales to residential customers decreasing 14% and commercial deliveries down 6%. On a weather-adjusted basis however, total distribution deliveries increased slightly in the residential and commercial sectors compared to the third quarter of 2016. And industrial sales continued their positive trend, with growth of more than 1% compared to last year. In our transmission business, third quarter earnings benefited from higher revenues, resulting from our continued investment in the Energizing the Future program. In the Competitive business, our results were flat compared to the third quarter of 2016. While commodity margin reflects lower contract sales rates and the expected decline in retail sales, it was offset by lower operating expenses, including depreciation, O&M, fuel and general taxes. FES' total retail customer count is now about 842,000 compared to 1.4 million a year ago. We are raising our 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the Competitive business to $525 million to $555 million, primarily reflecting the delay in the Allegheny Supply gas and hydro asset sale and lower operating expenses. We are very pleased with our results for the first three quarters of the year and the progress we've achieved on our strategic initiatives and we are especially pleased that S&P updated its outlook of FirstEnergy in August from negative to stable, reflecting their confidence in our efforts to become fully regulated. We will continue our focus on meeting our commitments to shareholders and executing our regulated growth plans. Before we open the lines for your questions, Chuck has an additional comment. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Jim. I know you're eager to ask questions and I won't keep you long, but I wanted to take this opportunity to reinforce an important message. I've always said I believe very strongly in transparent communications and today we provided a comprehensive update on the status of affairs at FES. So, while I'm sure you will have many questions about the status of negotiations with creditors and their advisors, we have been very clear that we will not conduct these negotiations in public. We recognize the varied interests of our stakeholders, but we're also aware that some have an interest in floating rumors about our company. I urge you to only rely on information that comes directly from us and you will only find that in a public forum or filing. Now, let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the results. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Julien. Welcome back. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you so much. So, perhaps I'll try to be diplomatic about this. With respect to the FES situation and the DOE efforts, can you give us a little bit of a sense on how the timeline itself might be shifting? Obviously, there's a number of factors. Are you thinking that there could be some sort of attempt to wait it out to see what happens out of this process, obviously, they're trying to be expedited and/or any legislative efforts? How might all three, with respect to timing, tie into each other? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Julien, I don't think there's any connection between them. We're moving forward with our efforts to exit the commodity-exposed generation business. I mentioned that we began or FES began discussions with the creditors in September. Those discussions are ongoing. I know that they opened up a data room and there's a lot of due diligence going on. I think that's going to probably take some time to get to closure. And I said in my remarks, I think the preferred outcome is to get a settlement with creditors. So, the DOE effort, if it stays on the track that the Department of Energy set up, which is an end of December 11, I think that they're going to happen all in the same timeframe, but I don't think there's any delays going on anywhere. We're moving forward and we're watching to see what happens out of the DOE. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then, secondly, I just want to set the record straight a little bit. What is your attitude towards retaining any of the legacy assets in an attempt to negotiate something? I don't want to talk about the negotiations per se, but what is the palatability of retaining, for instance, any of the nuclear assets? I just want to be very clear about this one, particularly if you are successful with legislation and/or anything else to kind of change the view of it being perhaps a little bit more contracted like than not Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I want to be very clear too. FirstEnergy's strategy is to become fully regulated. We have no interest in maintaining generating assets that have commodity exposure and we're moving forward with exiting the commodity-exposed generation business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Thank you so much for the transparency. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First, I just wanted to clarify, I think, Chuck, you said that you were going to be giving at EEI an update on the load analysis. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I want to make sure I heard that right, but does that suggest a more kind of holistic update of your outlook or what else should we expect at the conference just in terms of broad outline? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we don't want to give it all away today, but, yeah, I think you would expect a little more holistic look at what's happening with our loads and any impact that might have on the growth rates that we've given previously. And we plan to give you a more clearer view of where we think our future is right now. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, thank you for that. And secondly on, you talked about the Corporate segment, an outperformance there having been a driver of the guidance raise. Can you give us a little more what's driving that and whether you'd see that flowing through beyond this year? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Jonathan, this is Jim. That's primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate slightly offset by the bond offering that we did earlier this year. So, we would expect that benefit to carry through to the remainder of the year and that's where we updated our guidance there midpoint. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, if I may, just given the commentary around the commitment to exit the Competitive business and see that through, if we kind of fast forward to when you reach that point, how will you think about your equity financing needs once you're in that more stable setup? Should we think of the sort of ongoing issuance that you talked about last year as part of the plan or could you see a scenario where you'd want to put some of that behind you more up front? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, we have publicly stated an intent to issue $1.5 billion of additional equity between now and the end of 2019. We intend to move forward with that. I would say we reserve the right to decide how and when to do that, but the total amount isn't going to change and it's going to be done by the end of 2019. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you very much, Chuck. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to discuss the Department of Energy proposal. If FERC did decide to go ahead and move forward with what the Department of Energy has recommended, but the proposal gets mired in legal challenge, would that be enough for you all to decide to retain the business, because after all I guess really under the DOE approach, the assets effectively would be contracted utility-like assets or would that not be enough for you to want to retain the business? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, Stephen, let me just say this. I don't think the DOE initiative has anything to do with FirstEnergy despite what's been reported in some of the media. I think it has to do with preserving critical fuel-secure baseload generating facilities. And I think that that's what it will do whether FirstEnergy owns them or whether FES creditors own them or whether FES creditors sell them to a third party that we don't even know of today. I think the most important thing that they are focused on is correcting the market deficiencies that do not compensate these plants for the attributes that they bring to the grid. Beyond that, I don't think it's appropriate for me to speculate on any outcomes. When we have the outcomes, we'll react to them. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And then, just shifting gears over to Pleasants, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit further about next steps in terms of the process of approval and just what we should be looking out for there. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Stephen, this is Leila. So, the hearing process is complete. The briefs are in and we will be expecting a commission decision. There's no timeline in which they have to act, but we are hopeful that we will receive an order in the first quarter of next year. With regard to the FERC piece of that, I believe January 18 is the date by which FERC would have to act. So if the West Virginia Commission were so inclined and wanted to see what was happening there, they might act after that. So, that's the timeline associated with Pleasants right now. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Okay. So first, a question about equity. So, it's the end of October. I know you guys mentioned that you would be issuing equity late this year. How should we think about it? Are you going to try to infuse equity into your pension plan or is it going to be a block equity sometimes in late fourth quarter? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, Angie, we haven't decided yet and I would say, when we issued it into the pension plan last year, it was I think a very successful way to do it. But as I said, we are committed to doing $1.5 billion between now and the end of 2019. We're reviewing the timing of that all the time and we'll go to our board at the appropriate time when we're ready to do that. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood. Secondly, okay, so it's a bit of a surprise, I think, at least to us that the state legislative initiatives that support you nuclear asset is progressing given the fact that the governor has been opposed to it. So, what has changed? Do you think that this DOE NOPR has changed the minds of the legislators? I mean, do you think that if New Jersey and now Connecticut stand by their nuclear plants, that's going to actually sway the legislature or the governor? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think it's all of the above. I think the fact that New York and Illinois have \u2013 already taking measures to protect these fuel-secured nuclear facilities in particular, the DOE initiative on top of it, the fact that other states concurrently are looking at it, all are creating an awareness about what's going on in our nation and the importance of these assets to not only physical security, but also economic security. So, I don't think it's a surprise that Ohio is willing to relook at it. I think we've got to deal with the legislature first. And then, once we have the legislature passing the bill, then we'll see where the governor really is at that time. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Kind of lastly, obviously, don't want to steal the thunder from the EEI, but are you trying to suggest that the higher load growth at the T&D business could warrant higher CapEx? Is that what you're suggesting? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I am not suggesting anything specifically. We're still, as I said, finalizing our load projections and we'll just give you the whole picture at EEI. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : I see that when I look on page \u2013 trying to find it here, sorry, yeah, page 17 of your presentation, you footnoted the impact of pension OPEB. I know you take \u2013 make one-time adjustments every year and you've given us those impacts here. Are those \u2013 those discount rates are down, is that around 25 basis points from the prior assumptions? Is that correct? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's correct, Greg. Last year, when we made our actuarial assumption, we had a discount rate of 4.25%. Right now, it's just above 4%. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then, when I skip forward to page 31, where you give us the FE parental guarantees and other assurances to FES, we have a $712 million unfunded pension and OPEB obligation as of 12/31/16. Should we assume that, that number is going to go up as a reflection of the lower discount rates when you give us the year-end number? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, Greg. That'll go up slightly and we'll revise that when we get to the end of the year and finalize what our actual returns were on the assets as well as what the final discount rate is. And as you know, we don't measure that until December 31. It's whatever the rate is at the end of the year. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Have you given rules of thumb in the past as to what change in discount rate might mean to those \u2013 to that balance before performance offsets? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: No. We've never done that for FES in particular, but the rule of thumb on a change in the discount rate, it impacts liability by about $250 million. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : But that's across the whole company? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's across the whole company. That's correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : And a subset of that would be at the utilities, which is recoverable and the subset of that would be at FES, where it would increase this exposure, correct? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please state your questions. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Chuck, Jim. Just, I guess, one question on the sales update. Could you just maybe remind what your prior projections were in the plan that you gave? I guess, the last time you gave plan was really last year's EEI for sales growth? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes. Steve, last year, we had pretty much a flat overall growth. We had a slight decline in residential and commercial offset with an increase in industrial, but for total, it was less than a 1% growth rate. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then, on the proceeds that you're going to get to $350 million that you talked to from the kind of AES, you're going to leave that in the unregulated money pool? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, that's right. I mean there'll be about $350 million left after we paid down debt as well as the make-whole premium and that $350 million will just go into the money pool. That's correct. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And are you going to kind of leave it there till FES has resolved or can you bring that into FE Corp. essentially? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: That will come into FE Corp. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. All right. I will leave it at that. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey, guys. Question on the regulated side of the shop. First of all, can you give an update for your expectations of where the New Jersey infrastructure strawman process kind of goes? And second, if the strawman doesn't happen, when do you think you would potentially file again in New Jersey? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I'll take the first half, and I think it's really great to be in a position in New Jersey to even be having discussions with the BPU about a going-forward view of infrastructure improvement. And we're going to keep those discussions going and we hope to get resolved with something that we can both mutually agree to. Beyond that, I'll turn it over to Leila to answer the second question. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: So, I assume you were referring to the infrastructure investment program and the proposed rules, which we are hoping that will be in place by the end of the year, very similar with some of the mechanisms, if you would, to the disc in Pennsylvania and, as Chuck alluded to, a very positive move for New Jersey. So, we will be looking at that just like we did in Pennsylvania to provide a program under it. If we don't use that, we always on a continuous basis in New Jersey and across all our states continue to monitor and see when a rate case may be justified. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Based on your last rate case, I forget, when can you file again? Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: I don't think we have a moratorium, but... Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No restriction in New Jersey, but there's no date certainly for a filing. We'll file when we think it's appropriate. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Chuck, thanks, Leila, much appreciated. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Actually almost everything I have was answered. Just a really quick one, on the MAIT settlement, why did it cause an impairment? It wasn't a big one. So, I'm sort of wondering why that happened. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: There was some regulatory assets that we had on the books, Paul, that as part of the settlement process we agreed to not to recover those. So, we took the impairment this quarter. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And what were those assets associated with? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Vegetation management and storm costs, deferred storm costs. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I got it. Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks guys. So firstly, on the increased guidance for 2017, it looks like a majority of it is CES. Is the delay in asset close or the delay in the close of a transaction part of the reason for that or is it purely driven by market prices and the other factors you mentioned in the call? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah, you got it. A portion of that increase is associated with the delay in the asset sale, but we've also had some favorable O&M. Beaver Valley 2 as well as Perry, they returned from their outages a little sooner than we had expected. We had a property tax settlement in Ohio that has improved that somewhat and we've also seen some improvements in our nuclear decommissioning, which drove some of the increase. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, but how much would you attribute to the delayed close, because the jump is quite meaningful? So wanted to understand how much was all the other factors and how much was just the fact that you had the assets for a little longer? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I'd say about $0.06 is associated with the delayed sale. We had about a $0.07 improvement in our O&M. Property taxes were a couple cents and the NDT was about $0.03. So, that gets you to the $0.18. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's super helpful color. And then, secondly, on the asset sale itself, it seems like quite a bit was renegotiated, right? The price came down by $100 million. You added some more assets and then you have to pay out the $100 million for the change in control on the debt. I was just trying to understand what triggered all of that? Like what drove that significant change in the price and the fact that you had to pay for the change in control? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Really, the change in control, the calling of that debt, we had generally always expected that we would have to do that. The $100 million change is just, I would say the sale was priced on the existing market conditions. And really, the other assets that we included, the Buchanan, I don't have the exact \u2013 I think it was only like 61 megawatts or something like that. It was a very, very small addition of assets. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Understood. And then just finally, in terms of the parental support from FE to FES, obviously there's the pension OPEB and you've provided great color in the past in terms of what FE is supporting FES with. Is there an update on that? Is that something you aim to provide on a regular basis, so we know all the different components? Obviously, there's some money pool and some other liabilities, but wanted to get more clarity on all the different pieces. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. I think we've laid out all of the guarantees on one of our slides in the presentation, so that they're still pretty consistent. And as we said earlier on the call, the money pool is about $67 million right now and we would expect through the forecast period we have through March of next year that the money pool would probably go down to about zero to possibly some money actually invested in the money pool. So other than that, that's everything we have out there and nothing's changed. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. Super helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Jim, you guys obviously had a very successful bond issuance and refinancing back in early June. Could you just give us an update on your thoughts on parent-level credit capacity versus kind of where you stand today? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: From our standpoint, we did have a very successful bond offering. From my standpoint, I don't see us increasing that capacity any. In fact, I think Chuck and I would like to decrease the leverage at the holding company somewhat. We do have capacity where we could issue several billion dollars more in debt, but that is not in any of our plans at this point. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's pretty clear I think. And then, Chuck, I respect that you don't want to give any extra detail on the negotiations with creditors, but I did want to just clarify some comments in your prepared remarks. Is it fair to say you've had or the FES Board has had two separate meetings with some creditor group since the last earnings call and that that creditor group, to your knowledge, represents a meaningful portion of the outstanding bondholders? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: In my prepared remarks, I said there have been meetings. I have no idea how many meetings they've had, but I do understand that it represents a broad spectrum of the bondholders and a majority of the bondholders from what FES has communicated. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thanks. I guess that DMR comes up for renewal, when would you expect \u2013 would you expect to file sometime next year, I guess, for the two-year extension or when would you plan on filing? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Paul, you're right. Right now, it's a three-year period. It goes through 2019. It's our expectation that we'd likely file early in 2019 for that extension. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then, you talked about certain changes that are required for the Bath transaction to basically close. Can you provide sort of any insight as to what those changes might involve? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Not changes, Paul. We need an operating agreement between the owners and there are multiple owners. And we're just working through the process of getting that operating agreement completed. When that's completed, the transaction can go forward. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Right. But I mean, as I recall, that was a complicating factor sort of the first time around, right, that there were required changes that needed to be made to the operating agreement and it sounded as if that didn't happen. And then, you went through the whole renegotiation process. So, is there something that would make those changes more likely this time than in the sort of the previous round? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I don't think there's any issue with getting an operating agreement in place other than the time that it takes to do it. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then, lastly, in terms of liquidity, it looks as if there's adequate liquidity at least until March of 2018 with respect to FES. Is there anything else that you would see that would potentially precipitate a filing sort of earlier than the liquidity sort of concerns that you've outlined? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I'm not going to speculate on behalf of the FES Board what might drive their decisions. So, there's nothing that is material that we haven't communicated. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I just had a quick follow-up on the guidance. The $0.07 you mentioned on O&M, was that purely related to the shorter outages than planned? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Majority of it, Paul, was associated with the outages. There has been a little bit less than advisory costs than what we had expected. And we've also had some lower expenses associated with our retail program, but the majority of it would be associated with planned outages. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, the property taxes, that should be ongoing. Is that fair? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, yes, that is new appraisal values for the plants. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, decommissioning trust will be what the market does, okay. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, that could go up or down based on how the market performs. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your questions. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Transmission CapEx, you had a fairly wide range of guidance, $800 million to $1.2 billion, at least that's the last fact book. I think that's still current. I suspect that the MAIT settlement doesn't really drive that from the lower-end in that range just because it's small. I suspect that reaching an agreement on FES doesn't really drive things, because you're not putting much money, much capital in FES anymore. What drives that then from the $800 million or the $1.2 billion over the next five years? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: We just put that range in there. If we get some distribution riders or some additional spend in distribution, we might diverge some of our capital there. But I think from our standpoint, you would look at probably about an average of $1 billion a year. You're right, the MAIT settlement with a 10.3% ROE, that's consistent with what we're earning in our ATSI program. So, I think it's just a range to determine where we wanted to devote our capital to. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): And then, when you settled the ATSI at the 10.38%, I think one of the statements you said, Jim, was that because of all the small projects you were doing, having that settlement, getting the framework in place was important. Is that the same thing with MAIT that take the lower ROE, but to have this framework, have the ROE status is critical? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah, I think it's important to get that settled. We believe that the 10.3% rate, it is consistent with current market conditions and consistent with our other transmission. So, we think it's valuable to get it settled and get the rates in place and move forward and start devoting some capital there. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thanks. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: And the projects that we're doing are very similar to what we talked about before. We're just moving them east. They're generally smaller projects that get completed and there was a lot of regulatory lag under our lagging formula rate that we don't have any more. Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay, fine. I'll save the rest for EEI. Thank you. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, guys. My questions were actually answered. Thanks. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Shar, take care. Operator : Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Chuck, real quick one. At what point do you feel comfortable or believe that FE will be back in the position, where the company is going to be back in a position to kind of contemplate dividend growth again? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I think first of all, we've got to get this exit of commodity-exposed generation behind us, Michael, and understand what the going-forward state of our company is. Where our dividend's at today, I don't think there's any reason that we would need to think about increasing it, because it's a very competitive dividend and we'll deal with that down the road once we get through this strategic restructuring of our company. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you all and look forward to seeing you at EEI. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with a presentation which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid 2017 results along with 2018 earnings guidance and a growth rate that provides investors with visibility into our regulated opportunities through 2021. Our operating earnings results surpassed our original guidance for the year and are near the upper end of the revised range we provided last quarter. We have now achieved three straight years of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of the operating earnings guidance we provided to investors. I am proud of the financial discipline our entire team has shown over this three-year period. Our 2017 operating earnings reflect the strong financial performance in our distribution and transmission businesses as well as the positive impact of our regulated growth strategy. Our GAAP earnings were impacted by impairments and plant exit costs at our competitive business as well as charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Jim will discuss these in more detail shortly. We are gratified that our plans to transform our company into a highly performing, fully regulated utility earned the confidence of several prominent investors who made a $2.5 billion equity investment in our company last month to support this transition. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the positive impacts this transaction is having on our company. First, it allowed us to strengthen FirstEnergy's balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. We used some of the proceeds to make a $750 million contribution to our employee pension plan, coupled with a $500 million contribution we made earlier in 2018. We don't expect any further required contributions to the pension through 2020. We also reduced holding company debt by $1.45 billion and, as a result, we are positioned for a sustained investment grade credit metrics through at least 2021. This transaction also eliminates the need to issue any additional equity outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans during our current planning period which runs through 2021. Second, the transaction facilitates an accelerated growth in infrastructure investment improvement program for our transmission and distribution businesses. For 2018, we are introducing regulated operating earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per diluted share. This represents operating earnings from our distribution and transmission businesses, net of the corporate segment. With those regulated operating earnings as our base, we're also introducing a long-term regulated operating earnings growth rate projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. This excludes the DMR in Ohio and is offset by the corporate segment. This growth rate reflects incremental investments in both the distribution utilities and transmission companies which I will discuss later for a total capital investment of more than $10 billion over that timeframe. I will note that these projections are presented on a fully diluted basis reflecting the full impact of the preferred shares in 2018. Beginning with first quarter 2018 results, we intend to report on a fully diluted basis to provide you with a comparative view of the company's performance. Finally, our January transaction includes the formation of a Restructuring Working Group or RWG that will advise our FirstEnergy management team as it addresses any potential restructuring at FES. The restructuring working group includes three FirstEnergy executives : Jim Pearson, Leila Vespoli, and Gary Benz, our Senior Vice President of Strategy; along with outside industry professionals, John Wilder of Bluescape and Tony Horton of Energy Future Holdings. The group has already started work, and they received a presentation from FES management to help the outside members become familiar with the business. FES continues to meet with its creditor advisors, and we anticipate that the RWG will be involved in those discussions at some point as well. It's important to emphasize that RWG is serving FirstEnergy's management and that FirstEnergy Solutions board of directors will continue to make decisions about FES, including any restructuring decisions. Together, these actions are designed to transform FirstEnergy by allowing us to fully shift our focus towards the tremendous opportunities in our regulated growth strategy. So let's review the very strong full-year operating performance at our regulated businesses and other developments across our company. In our transmission business, we saw higher 2017 earnings as we completed the initial phase of our Energizing the Future investment program. During the first four years of the program, we invested more than $4 billion to support system reliability and enhanced service to our customers. For the second phase of the program, we're increasing the low end of our targeted annual investments by $200 million. This will bring our planned investments to $1 billion to $1.2 billion annually through 2021. During the second phase, we will continue expanding the program into the Eastern part of our service territory. In December, JCP&L filed a settlement agreement with FERC that provides for rates effective January 1, pending a final FERC order, and also provides JCP&L the opportunity to file for forward-looking rates to be effective in 2020. We expect FERC to rule on that settlement as well as the MAIT settlement that we filed in October in the next several months. In our distribution business, 2017 was a great year. Our results reflect the new rates that went into effect in several of our service territories last January, which more than offset the $0.19 per share impact of milder weather compared to 2016. We're also pleased with the load trends that emerged throughout the year. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial deliveries were consistent with our forecast while residential load exceeded our original expectations. In addition, we have now achieved six consecutive quarters of growth in industrial deliveries, primarily driven by the shale gas, steel and petroleum industries. Together, 2017 operating earnings from our Regulated Distribution and Transmission businesses, offset by the corporate segment, reflect an increase of more than 25% over 2016 or 14% when you exclude the DMR. As we look at 2018 and beyond, our Ohio utilities filed an application with the PUCO in December for a $450 million three-year plans to redesign and modernize portions of their distribution system to reduce the frequency and duration of power outages as well as prepare the system for smart grid technologies. The Distribution Platform Modernization plan will help our Ohio utilities to restore power faster, strengthen the system against adverse weather conditions, and enhance system performance by allowing remote monitoring of real-time grid conditions. In New Jersey, the BPU approved rulemaking for the Infrastructure Investment Program in December. This creates a mechanism that allows utilities to accelerate certain investments that enhance reliability, resiliency, and safety. We expect JCP&L to make a filing later this year. Incremental growth initiatives represented by our increased transmission investment and filings in Ohio and New Jersey, as well as a modest distribution rate case in Maryland are the primary drivers of the increase in our projected regulated operating earnings growth rate to 6% to 8%. Finally, before I move away from the utility discussion, I will note that Mon Power and Potomac Edison are evaluating alternatives to address their projected capacity shortfall in West Virginia. Given the outcome of our application to transfer ownership of Allegheny Energy's Pleasants Power Station to Mon Power, our purchase agreements was terminated in light of FERC's decision and the West Virginia Public Service Commission's conditions, which would have resulted in significant exposure to commodity risk at our utility. As a result, on Friday, Allegheny Energy notified PJM that the Pleasants Power Station will deactivate on January 1, 2019. We will continue to pursue opportunities to sell the plant while we prepare for deactivation. Moving to other Allegheny Energy news, you'll recall that in December, we completed the sale of 859 megawatts of generating capacity at the Springdale, Chambersburg, Gans, and Hunlock plants for approximately $388 million in net proceeds. The transactions involving the Buchanan and Bath plants are each on track and expected to close in the first half of this year. After paying off all remaining long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply, including make-whole premium payments, the net proceeds to Allegheny Energy Supply from the sale of all six of these facilities are expected to be about $220 million. Let's turn now to FirstEnergy Solutions. It is common knowledge that we were very actively involved in a multitude of efforts at both the state and federal levels to support our generation assets in a way that would have benefited our communities, employees and FES creditors. I'm personally disappointed that the endeavors haven't resulted in a meaningful legislative or regulatory support given the importance of these plants to grid resiliency, reliable and affordable power and the region's economy. FES will continue to look at all options regarding these units, and we will continue to support policy solutions. However, as Jim will discuss, we have fully impaired our nuclear assets because the inability to receive any form of legislative or regulatory support has increased the likelihood that the plants will not be able to operate until the end of their useful lives. At the end of January, FES, its subsidiaries and FENOC were $46 million invested in the unregulated money pool. We expect that they will exit the money pool sometime between now and the end of March and draw down the $500 million secured credit facility from FirstEnergy. The current forecast shows FES to have money pool borrowings of up to $100 million between now and March 31. As we prepare for our future as a fully regulated utility, we are continuing our efforts to ensure that our organization is well positioned to grow and prosper and that our cost structure is properly aligned, particularly at our shared services organization. Last year, we told you that we launched an initiative called FE Tomorrow to create this blueprint for our future. The FE Tomorrow team worked with Accenture to develop a variety of scenarios to achieve this goal. Now, as we move closer to our vision of becoming fully regulated, we're entering the next stage of that effort. A team of employees reporting to Jim Pearson has been charged to implementing the FE Tomorrow strategies over the next 12 to 24 months. As we announced yesterday, Jim has been named Executive Vice President, Finance. While he will continue to oversee the financial organization, this new role will ensure he can give his utmost attention to FirstEnergy Tomorrow and the RWG. Steve Strah, our Senior Vice President of FirstEnergy Utilities, will be stepping into the CFO position, reporting to Jim. And Sam Belcher, our Senior Vice President of FENOC and Chief Nuclear Officer, will take over Steve's role as Senior Vice President of Utilities. These changes and several others announced yesterday strengthen our succession planning by moving key individuals into new roles that will broaden their knowledge of our business. We believe this will help ensure that FirstEnergy is positioned to continue meeting our commitments to investors and customers well into the future. 2017 was a great year for our regulated businesses. We're very excited about the transformation that is taking place at FirstEnergy and for the opportunity to accelerate our regulated growth and infrastructure improvement plans that will benefit our 6 million customers, as well as our shareholders. Now, Jim, will provide a review of the fourth quarter results. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning, everyone. As always, we have provided detailed information about the quarter in our consolidated report to the financial community which is posted on our website. Yesterday, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of $5.62 per share that reflects asset impairment and plant exit cost at our competitive generation fleet and charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will take a few minutes to discuss these items before I move on to fourth quarter drivers. We recorded asset impairment and plant exit cost of $2.4 billion or $3.38 per share in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of reducing the carrying value of the Pleasants Power Station, fully impairing our nuclear-generating assets and increasing our nuclear asset retirement obligations, given the outlook for the fleet. In addition, our fourth quarter GAAP results, include a non-cash charge of $1.2 billion or $2.68 per share related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which primarily impacted our competitive business given its significant deferred tax asset position. We are working with all of our state regulatory commissions to determine the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on utility customer rates which would flow through to our FFO given that we aren't a federal cash tax payer. Shifting gears to the results from our operations during the fourth quarter, we had a very strong operating earnings of $0.71 per share. Driving those results was a $0.23 per share improvement in our distribution business compared to the same period in 2016. This primarily reflected the new rates that went into effect in January 2017 as well as higher weather-related usage. Heating degree days were normal for the quarter but 9% higher than the same period of 2016. This drove a nearly 2% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. In the residential sector, sales were up 4%, while commercial deliveries were down 3%. On a weather-adjusted basis, fourth quarter residential deliveries were essentially flat, while commercial deliveries decreased 4% as a result of lower sales and energy efficiency efforts compared to the same period of 2016. Looking at industrial sales, the positive trends continued in the fourth quarter with growth of more than 3% compared to last year, driven by gas drilling and the recovery in steel. In the transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of higher revenues related to our Energizing the Future program. Fourth quarter operating earnings in the competitive business improved due to favorable depreciation and general taxes, partially offset by lower commodity margin and higher O&M expenses. As always, we will remain focused on meeting our commitments to our shareholders and executing our regulated growth plans. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Thanks, Jim. Now, we will move into the question-and-answer phase of our call. I want to preface the Q&A that we will not be able to provide detailed information about the status of negotiations with FES credit advisers or creditors. FES has been operating independently since early 2017, and neither I or the other executives on this call can speak on behalf of FES. Now, let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Congratulations. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So, first off, can you talk a little bit about the CapEx that you're reflecting here? How much of the latest JCP&L and Ohio efforts are reflected in that range that you guys just released here? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Julien, this is Jim. At the upper end of our guidance, we've included the $450 million filing that we made in Ohio, as well as we anticipate that we'll make a filing later this year in New Jersey for the Infrastructure Improvement Plan. So, I'd say at the top end of the range, it includes the $450 million in Ohio, and it also includes some money for the Infrastructure Improvement Plan in New Jersey. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then turning back to the earned ROEs, can you talk about what's kind of embedded as you think on the outer years of that regulated guidance? And specifically, can you talk a little bit more to Pennsylvania and what your thoughts are there? I know that there are some deferred tax items in the regulatory filings there and that's created a little bit of obfuscation out there and truly understanding what the earned returns are. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Julien, in Pennsylvania, the ROEs have not been defined since there was a settlement in those cases. When I think about Pennsylvania and I've heard a little bit of the questions that you just raised but we've just had two cases that have been fully tried in Pennsylvania. They've been before the staff of the Commission as well as the Commission itself. And I'd also note that when I look at our residential rates in Pennsylvania and compare them to our peers, we're about 13% below what our peers are in that state. So I don't see where there's any concern about where we're at in Pennsylvania. And you are right on the deferred taxes. There's a number of adjustments associated with deferred taxes in a rate-making process versus what you look at just from a pure GAAP standpoint. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So I'll just follow on with that based on everything Jim said. There should be absolutely no concern in the market about us over-earning in Pennsylvania. And if there is any hysteria out there, you all are smart enough to know that there are people that trade off with the hysteria. But I just want to emphasize there should be no concern whatsoever. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. And then overall, across the utilities, what are you reflecting out in the 2020/2021 timeframe? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: As far as what, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Earned returns, just in the longer dated regulated numbers you just released. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think you would see that we're assuming that our earned returns on all the utilities would approximate what we had in our filings out there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Fair enough. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: And again (00:23:22) but we're right in line with those. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted touch on tax reform and just when we think about the rate base numbers that you've laid out, how much of an impact upward in terms of an increase in your rate base could be attributed to tax reform? Has that been a material impact at all in terms of your overall sort of projected rate base or has that not really been a driver in the numbers that you've laid out here? K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Stephen. It's Jon. I think we actually have a slide on that. But if you remember, the only thing that's really going to impact us is the elimination of bonus depreciation which was scaling down anyway under the original tax code. So that was 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019. That would be about a $400 million uplift to rate base with the elimination of those two years. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And so that's the extent of it. I'm sorry. K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Both on the Regulated Distribution and Transmission businesses. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. And just on FES, I respect that we really can't get into discussion on the negotiations. I just wanted to understand from FirstEnergy's perspective, you know there's an upcoming bond payment due. Occasionally, there's concern raised about whether or not FirstEnergy might extend the period of effective ownership of FES or \u2013 I'm really effectively trying to just check with you all on your firmness for the timeline of exiting that business and just get your latest thinking on that. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I said in my prepared remarks that I expect that they will be removed from the unregulated money pool between now and the end of March, and that will be the last tie that we have with that business. While I can't speak for FES, I will be shocked if they go beyond as far out some type of a filing. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, Chuck. And just, I guess, related to that, when we think about the management of the business after that, a key upcoming item is the May capacity auction in PJM. Who would be sort of responsible at that point for the bidding strategy in dealing with some of these assets that appear to be fairly economically challenged? How would that sort of, in practice, play out? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: It's FES' decision whether and how to bid in that upcoming auction for the FES assets. It would be Allegheny Energy Supply's decision the same for the Pleasants Power Station, and it would be Mon Power's decision for the assets that are of Mon Power's. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's all I have. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : When we're looking to model out and sort of corroborate our comfort level with the earnings trajectory that you've laid out, I think what you're implying in the way that you've laid out your guidance is that we should assume that, at a minimum, you're getting incremental revenue requirement every year on the capital you're deploying through the rider mechanisms in the different states. But anything that's under a stated rate, the only sort of revenue increases outside of formal rate case would come from any organic revenue growth that you're able to generate. Is that fair? And then, how do we think about O&M? I think you're saying that we should assume that overall you'll keep control of O&M flat. Just trying to come up with a set of basic modeling parameters that we can use to corroborate your confidence level at, let's say, the midpoint of guidance. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Greg, you're right. And let me really be clear about what our guidance is. We have a midpoint of $2.15, and that is what the 6% to 8% growth rate is based off of, so it's a midpoint of $2.15 with a 6% to 8% growth rate. We do have baked in increases in revenues associated with any capital spend that falls under the riders, primarily our transmission spend as well as in Ohio at the upper end, the DMR that would fall under a rider, as well as we would expect the infrastructure improvement plan in New Jersey would. So stated rates, unless there is a filing, we would not get any increases from those other than on organic growth. Now we do have a modest rate case built in for Maryland, but that's the only rate case that we have in our guidance right now. From an O&M perspective, yes, you're correct. We're going to hold O&M flat, and you'll see an improvement in O&M associated with our pension expense. And that's primarily the result of our plan generated an additional $500 million in earnings in 2017 compared to what we expected as well as the additional $1.250 billion contribution that we made in January. So I hope that helps, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : It does. It does. And then the share count you've given us is fully diluted, assuming all of the preferreds convert, correct? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : So in actuality, in what year will that average share count be the actual average share count because in the interim, we're actually being impacted with lower share count but the preferreds... James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: They would have to convert by the middle of 2019. So you're right there. The $536 million is fully diluted and I think we have it probably growing to about $545 million by 2021, and that just assumes the incremental equity issuance associated with our dividend reinvestment plans. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So that's the actual share count more or less in 2020, and then it grows as you continue to use your plans. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's correct. As we continue to issue through our plans, it would increase. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you, sir. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So I'll just follow on a little bit on the O&M. Our utility companies have done an outstanding job of managing O&M over really the last 10 to 15 years. And when you benchmark it, we have very low O&M costs compared to our peers, and that's one of the key drivers behind the fact, as Jim stated, in Pennsylvania, our rates are lower than our peers. And that's true pretty much in every state that we serve. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hi, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So, most of my questions were answered. But just from a modeling standpoint, there's been some very healthy growth that the slides are showing on your distribution year-over-year into 2018. What's sort of driving this especially since we have an absence of rate cases? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: What period are you looking at, Shar? Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Just from 2017 to 2018, looks like distribution is growing a little over 15%. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Let me take a shot at that, Shar. We have some revenue that will grow in 2018 compared to 2017. First, it reflects a full year of the Pennsylvania rate case. As you'll recall, that did not go into effect until the latter part of January, so we'll have a full year. We also have incremental revenues associated with the Ohio DCR. And then we have some growth in West Virginia associated with the industrial load that we've talked about where we expect some growth there. From a expense side, we expect improvement in our expenses, and that's primarily associated with the pension expense that I talked about earlier. And then we also assume that 2018 will be on a normal weather year. So that that would drive about $0.06 in earnings when you compare it to 2017. So I think those are the primary drivers, and that's offset a little bit by additional depreciation and general taxes. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful, Jim, and then just normalize it after that. Okay. And then just real quick on sort of tax reform, there's some preliminary evidence from several commissioners around the regions that they may not necessarily need a lot of that cash back immediately in order to obviously mitigate some rate volatility, et cetera. So when you sort of think about the plan you kind of laid out here, what's the base case scenario you're assuming in this kind of a growth outlook, especially given the fact that you're in multiple states? And then is there an opportunity, especially given the O&M leverage you have, in order to accelerate some of that distribution spending especially in light of your O&M levers and tax savings that you have? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Let me take that. In our base plan, we have not recognized any benefit associated with tax reform. Right now, we're working with all five of the commissions to see what is the most appropriate way to handle this going forward. But when you look at our plan that we have out there, it does not recognize any benefits associated with tax reform. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. How are you? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just on that last point. So, in Ohio, you guys are not planning on any benefit associated with the lower tax rate flowing through to earnings, is that correct? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: We have no benefit in our plan that we laid out, that's correct, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Because there was some filings, I guess, about how \u2013 there was some position that perhaps because it wasn't a general rate case, it was a base rate case that there won't be a true-up until 2024. Is there any \u2013 could you elaborate a little bit on that or what the difference is in that? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we have a stay-out provision through May 31, 2024. So, technically, we will not begin to adjust our rates for any reason, whether expenses go up, whether taxes go up or taxes go down. I can say that we've already addressed the riders. The DMR and DCR filed for lower taxes there. But we have not done anything on the other side with Ohio other than in our plan that we've laid out, we have not incorporated any of those tax benefits. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So in other words, so just to make it crystal clear, the fact that tax rates are going down will not \u2013 they're not going to be benefiting your EPS in terms of the guidance that you provided, is that correct? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Right now, they will not be benefiting our guidance, right, and we're not flowing anything through. Those would be deferred at this point. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, great. And then the FES, I understand that the auction decisions and what have you are going to be done by FES is your expectation. But you guys are obviously going to be very much apprised about what's going on in the wholesale market just from being a big utility operating in it. What is your expectation or thoughts about \u2013 since you haven't gotten \u2013 since policy has not shown up to be supportive of the power plants? Incrementally, how many power plants, just generally speaking, do you think might be leaving, might not be participating or at least clearing the auction in May? Do you follow what I'm saying? I mean, I know that you're not necessarily going to be making the decision there, but just in general, when you guys are looking out there and you're looking at supply and demand and what have you, just from a strategic perspective, what are you guys thinking might be the amount of capacity that fails to show up or to clear the auction, if you follow me? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I'm not going to speculate about what others might do with their assets. I'll just give you my simple view of the future. Unless something is done to change the construct of these administrated markets which have been administrated in a way to disadvantaged coal and nuclear plants, over the long haul, unless the states step in to provide support, there will be no coal or nuclear plants left in these markets. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan: Good morning, Chuck and Jim. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Good morning. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan: For the corporate segments, the guidance that you guys provided is a lot lower than we had been modeling. I'm wondering if you moved any corporate costs or other costs from FES or the unregulated segment into there and that is baked into the guidance range that you give. And then also if there's any kind of successful cost cutting baked into that as well as we go out in the plan? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. What we've assumed in the plan is that none of the costs that are currently being charged to FES are included, other than about $25 million associated with depreciation and that's associated with common systems that we have between FES and ourselves, and that would be accounting systems, payroll, accounts payable, something like that. The other impact on the corporate side is we've lost some of the tax shield where the interest used to be deducted at a 35% rate. Now, it's a 21% rate. So, that's driving some of that difference. But I would expect, in the plan going forward, corporate would hold flat in about the $0.55 range. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan: Okay. So, you're including only $25 million of depreciation moved into corporate in the plan, but you think that given everything you know that's pretty realistic with all of your cost-cutting efforts to date and going forward at the corporate level? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's correct. That's what we have built in there. That's right. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan: Okay. And then my second question is you've mentioned just no incremental equity needs going forward other than the internal plans that were previously part of your guidance. Anyway I just wanted to make sure that you're confident that you can fund the existing or the new CapEx program entirely with internal cash flows and debt. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes, we are comfortable we can do that and you'll see we do have some new debt built into the plan. But when you think of a transmission spend that is in the $4 billion to $4.8 billion range, typically about half of that is funded through debt as well as any new capital above what we have in distribution would be new debt. But yeah, we're very confident we can do that internally. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No additional equity through 2021. I can't believe its only one month after doing $2.5 billion that we're already getting that question again. But there will be none. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan: Okay. Fair enough, guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill - UBS: Yeah. Thank you. Can you talk to the $450 million Distribution Platform Modernization plan in Ohio just kind of what sort of reception you've gotten since you filed it and what the process is there and any \u2013 how you thought about scaling it and if there's likely to be any change, up or down, to the program? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, up till now, we have just been answering questions from the staff about what it is, what it does, how it helps customers. And beyond that, I don't think we're in a position to really say. I'd ask Leila to add to that but... Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: So the impetus behind that, we had another filing out there for a more full-blown, if you would, grid modernization plan. That kind of got stalled when the Commission was having its different platform and then the discussions around the state. And so we looked at our system, and there are certain things that can be done and should be done that any smart grid system can be built off of. And so that's what we have in front of them. So it's a way for the Commission to consider it, to not tie their hands. And quite frankly, as you're looking at the spend, to kind of phase it in. So \u2013 and discussions we had pre-filing, it was warmly received. And we'll see \u2013 we don't have a schedule yet in terms of hearings, whether they can meet the date we requested or whether it might have to slip a little bit. But the concept, in any regard, was warmly received when we shared it with the Commission. Gregg Orrill - UBS: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks so much. So my question is on tax reform. And I understand that it's not really built into the forecast right now or the plan you've put out. But from a cash flow perspective, can you just walk through what you expect the cash flow impact to be because obviously revenue is coming down and you have DTL refunds as well. So what do you expect that cash flow impact to be and how is that impacting your FFO to debt? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: When we look at the full impact of tax reform, Praful, if we had to adjust all of the rates, it would probably impact our FFO to debt by about 1 to 1.5 percentage points. And right now, our forecast assumes those cash flows are not there and we still remain at about a 13% FFO through 2021. So, I'm not concerned about that. But when you think about the stated \u2013 or the formula rates, they will reset whenever those dates are. For the others, they'll reset whenever there's another rate proceeding or commissions decide to actually. As far as refunding customers, I think they'll follow the normalization rules, and ultimately those amounts will be refunded over the life of those assets, which is generally 30 to 40 years. So, any cash flows that flow through now that are not required to be flowed back to the customers immediately, then that's going to benefit our cash flow and it's going to further improve our FFO to debt. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I got you. That's helpful. So, in that refund, can you just break down the DTL portion of it? Is there a protected and unprotected portion and what is the assumption of refund on the unprotected piece? K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. Praful, this is Jon. There is an unprotected piece. It's very small in the grand scheme of things. The excess deferred taxes was about $2.3 billion. 95% of that, if not more, was related to property which would be protected and be refunded over the life of those assets. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. And then finally, just to add the DMR to it, I'm assuming in your current FFO to debt, you're building in the cash flow coming in from the DMR. If the DMR doesn't get extended, plus you have the FFO impact of the lower revenues and potentially some DTL refunds even though it's small, can you tell us what that FFO to debt looks like excluding DMR and then building in the impact of tax reform? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: That's right. As I've said earlier, Praful, we have built in the full impact of tax reform in our forecast. It goes through 2021. And also, we did not assume the DMR would be extended beyond 2019 and our FFO is still in the 13% range. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And the target for FFO is that level or is there a different target? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: I think we're comfortable with the plan we have right now, and the amount of capital investment that we plan to make that the 13% range is appropriate. As time goes on, we would like to drive that up somewhat, but I think we're very comfortable with where that is right now going to a fully regulated model and the amount of capital investment that we're planning to do. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And just finally is the parent debt to... Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Praful, we need to move on. We're running out of time and there are about six, seven more people in the queue to ask questions. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: So please limit your questions to one or two, not five or six. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. When you talk about I guess O&M as being a potential driver, I guess, can you quantify sort of the pension benefit that you're assuming numerically? And also, is there any further reduction in O&M beyond sort of the pension? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: The way I would look at the pension, Paul, is we probably have an incremental almost $1.750 billion and we're going to get a 7.5% return on that. So, the O&M benefit would probably be in about the $0.15 range. From an other O&M standpoint, we haven't built anything else in other than it would be flat. As Chuck said earlier, we are really very cost-effective within our utilities. Any cost reductions within those types of rates would have to be adjusted either through the formula rates or else when we go in for any rate proceedings. On the corporate side, we will continue to look at those cost to see if we can offset that $25 million in depreciation that we're assuming from the competitive side that we do not have anything built into the forecast we've given you. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: And I know it's been like gone over a lot. But just to clarify on tax reform, you're assuming that whatever potential benefit that would not flow through sort of immediately, you would treat, from an accounting perspective, as a deferral. So, from an income statement perspective, you would not be booking any benefit in 2018 or any of the other years? Is that sort of a reasonable way to think about tax reform in terms of your guidance? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: At this point, in our guidance, yes, we don't have any of that benefit baked into our earnings. From a cash flow standpoint, any cash that flows through, it will be upside to us but we don't have anything built into that either in our metrics. Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Chuck. How are you thinking about the range of potential outcomes from Mon Power in terms of their supply needs? And when specifically are those supply needs really coming to a head? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, I think in the short term, Michael, they would just meet any supply needs from the PJM market. And we are reevaluating what we need to do there. In another two years, we'll need to file another integrated resource plan anyway. But we are not planning to take another attempt at Pleasants, if that's what you're asking. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. I was thinking more in the lines of either new build or acquisition of existing assets that are in the market today but maybe acquiring them at an attractive price for customer and ratepayers? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, at this point, as I said it's too early. We're going to go back and sit down, and Mon Power is looking at all the options. They may, at some point, do another RFP, and I'm sure in that RFP, if they do it, they'll address what FERC determined to be shortcomings in the previous RFP, but it's too early to answer that question. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, real quickly, how big of a step-up \u2013 and this may be a Jim or a Steve question, how big of a step-up in transmission revenue are you expecting in 2018 versus 2017? Kind of like what are you baking in, in guidance there? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: At the low end of our guidance, Michael, we're assuming that we'll spend $1 billion in transmission. At the upper end, we would be at the $1.2 billion range. So I think in 2018 we'll have about a normal increase in revenues, as you've seen over the last year or two. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I was just checking because you referenced some of the settlements made in JCP&L, and I didn't know if they gave a one-time boost given the implementation of those this year. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: No. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah, I would look at probably from a revenue standpoint, our rate base growth will be about $0.07 in 2018 when you compare it to 2017, and then a little bit with the stated rates in JCP&L, that would be about probably another $0.03. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated. Thanks, guys. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just on the New Jersey IIP filing, can you give us some insight into what kinds of things you might consider putting in there? Will it be similar to the $450 million program in Ohio, or is this different kinds of components? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Well, we are developing it right now, Jonathan, and it's too early to talk about. So as soon as we are prepared to disclose it, probably, we will. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So it's not necessarily it may or may not be the same kind of Distribution Modernization stuff to be up. Thanks. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: I would say clearly, it will be projects and programs that are designed at improving reliability, improving resiliency, improving safety, security, et cetera, the types of things that the plan was intended for us to try to address. Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.: And Jonathan, just as you may know, the rule itself provides for project eligibility so, obviously, will stay within the parameters of that. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, as we sort of think about scale with the sort of current relative sizes of CapEx in Ohio versus New Jersey be a good place to start thinking about this or not necessarily? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. I think, it'd be on the order with what we filed in Ohio under the Distribution Platform Modernization. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could just on this pension topic, Jim, I just want to clarify the $0.15 you just referenced, is that the sort of bridge between 2017 and 2018? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yes. That's correct, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And is there any sort of quantifiable benefit from the assumption around slightly lower discount rate that it looks like you're bedding in as you go forward off of 2018 or is that fairly immaterial? I know you do the \u2013 your accounting's little differently. James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: Yeah. There's no benefit associated with the discount rate from an earnings standpoint. But we did, I think, provided a slide and showed what our assumptions were longer term on what the liability would be on a discount rate growing to 4.5%. And if we had to set that discount rate today, it probably already be at 4.25%. So, we think that's a pretty conservative estimate for the liability even. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But that's not driving the earnings guidance basically? James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.: No, no, no. No impact there. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. And I will literally have one question. So in Ohio, remember we met with the PUCO Chairman and he was emphasizing that your latest ESP included an understanding that the Ohio utilities will be investing in their distribution systems as called upon by the state. So in light of that, how does this $450 million Distribution Modernization plan compare to what this total investment opportunity here is, given what is perceived to be as years of under-investment for the distribution businesses? Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: The DMR was about $200 million a year. We just filed a plan to invest $450 million of that into the types of programs that the DMR was intended to contemplate. So, I think we are on track to substantially invest everything that they provided for us in that ESP. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Jones, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.: Okay. Thank you and thanks for your continued support of FirstEnergy. This will end our call. Take care, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities, LLC Angieszka Storozynski - Macquarie Research Operator : Greetings and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin. Meghan Beringer : Thank you, Brenda, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's first quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our Web site under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations Web site along with a presentation which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room who are available to participate in the question-and-answer session. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones. Charles E. Jones: Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone. Today, for the first time we are reporting earnings that represent FirstEnergy as a fully regulated company. We had a strong first quarter with GAAP earnings of $2.55 per share and operating earnings of $0.67 per share. Our GAAP earnings benefited from a $1.2 billion gain associated with the deconsolidation of FirstEnergy solutions, all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy nuclear operating company. As you know, the FES and FENOC Boards of Directors approved a Chapter 11 filing for these entities on March 31st. The filings do not include FirstEnergy or our distribution, transmission, regulated generation, or Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiaries. We recognize that these recent events, including FES's announcement that it intends to sell or deactivate two nuclear power plants in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania during the next three years have been challenging for our employees. They are also difficult for the community surrounding these plants that have worked hard to help preserve jobs and the many economic benefits that these generating units provide. We understand the importance of these plants to the regional economy and recognize that more than $5 million of our utility customers are still exposed to the uncertainty of competitive markets. Therefore, I will continue personally to advocate for regulatory or legislative solutions, including FES' application for an emergency order under the Federal Power Act that recognize the attributes of fuel secure baseload generation and to ensure our customers continue to have a stable, reliable power supply. I continue to believe we are doing long-term damage to our nation's infrastructure, and I intend to be a steady voice in pushing for more integrated policies and decision-making. Today we're extremely pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement in principle with two ad hoc groups of key FES creditors. The first representing a majority of all outstanding secured and unsecured funded debt at FES and its subsidiaries, and the second including a majority of Bruce Mansfield certificate holders. The agreement affirms previously announced guarantees and assurances of certain FES employee related obligations, which include unfunded pension and other employee benefits and provides for the waiver of certain intercompany claims held by FirstEnergy. Among them the $500 million secured credit facility, $200 million surety support and the rail settlement guarantee. It also provides substantial assistance from FirstEnergy on key business matters, while FES and FENOC continue their restructuring process. In addition, other major terms effective at emergence include : full release of all claims against FirstEnergy and related parties; a $225 million cash payment from FirstEnergy which includes a reversal of the $88 million NOL prefiling purchase; a tax note from FirstEnergy up to $628 million due December 31, 2022 bearing interest at the prevailing treasury rate which represents the estimated value of the worthless stock deduction and is designed to trade at the par value of the note when issued; the transfer of the Pleasants Power Station, which is currently owned by Allegheny Energy Supply to FES for the benefit of creditors; and a right of FirstEnergy to share in recoveries after an agreed-upon threshold is met. The agreement is subject to approval by the Boards of Directors of FirstEnergy, FES and its subsidiaries, FENOC, and Allegheny Energy Supply, the execution of definitive agreements and the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The ad hoc group also agreed to use its best efforts to have the official committee of the unsecured creditors, as well as any remaining key creditors join the settlement by June 15th. This agreement is a significant step towards FES ultimately emerging from bankruptcy and would settle a key issue in the FES bankruptcy process, so that the creditors may focus their efforts on a restructuring plan. 2018 operating earnings guidance and the long-term growth rate we introduced in February includes the guarantees and assurances that we previously disclosed, as well as other assumptions that fully capture the elements of this agreement. So we are affirming our 2018 operating earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share, as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 68% through 2020 [ph]. I\u2019d also like to be very clear on this next point. We continue to have no plans for additional equity beyond the annual $100 million in investment and employee benefit plans through 2021. In addition, we expect this agreement in principle to be credit positive. We are also introducing a second quarter earnings -- operating earnings guidance range of $0.47 to $0.57 per share. Let's turn now to our business going forward as a fully regulated utility. In our transmission business, we continue to implement our Energizing the Future investment program. More than 600 projects either underway or in the pipeline for 2018. We are on track to invest $1.1 billion in our transmission system this year consistent with the capital plans we announced in February. One of these is a $45 million transmission project in McKean County, Pennsylvania that will help maintain service reliability following the retirement of generating plants in the region. The project includes a new 230,000 volt transmission line that extends about 15 miles between existing substations in Bradford and Keating townships, as well as new equipment to help reduce the frequency and duration of power outages. This project, which began late last year, is expected to be completed by mid-May ahead of June 1, 2018 in service deadline. Another project nearing completion is a new 28 mile 138,000 volt transmission project in Erie and Sandusky counties in Ohio that is needed to maintain service reliability during periods of peak demand. We expect to energize the new line in late May. FERC approved our settlement agreement for JCP&L's transmission rates in February. New rates were effective January 1 and are retroactive to June 1, 2017. This agreement also offers JCP&L the opportunity to file for forward-looking formula rates to be effective in 2020. The MAIT settlement filed in October remains spending at FERC and we expect the ruling in the second quarter of 2018. In our distribution business, the first quarter weather adjusted load results closely matched our expectations, as Steve will discuss in more detail. During March, a series of Nor'easters brought high winds and heavy wet snow that caused extensive damage to the eastern portion of our system. Collectively these storms resulted in outages for millions of people in the Northeast. A total of 1.2 million FirstEnergy utility customers experienced outages as a result of these three storm events with our JCP&L and Met-Ed service territories hardest hit. In New Jersey alone, we replaced nearly 51 miles of wire, more than 750 poles and cleared trees at more than 5,400 locations during the restoration effort for the first two storms. Restoration for those storms involve more than 6,200 line workers, hazard responders and assessors, forestry crews, job dispatchers and electrical contractors. We know being without power is difficult for our customers and we're proud of the efforts by our employees, contractors, and outside utility crews to efficiently and safely make repairs in challenging conditions. We're working with Utility Commissions in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania to review our preparation and response to the outages. While we're confident that we met our commitments, we work with the Commissions to identify and implement any additional best practices that can help enhance the experience of our customers in these situations. In total, our utilities spend more than $355 million on restoration efforts during the first quarter, including $250 million in New Jersey and $80 million in Pennsylvania. Approximately $230 million of the total was O&M with all, but $10 million being deferred for future recovery. In Ohio, our application for a $450 million Distribution Platform Modernization plan remains pending at the PUCO. The request of the Commission's approval for this 3-year plan to redesign and modernize portions of our distribution system, which will help our Ohio utilities restore power faster, strengthen the system against adverse weather conditions, and enhance system performance by allowing remote monitoring of real-time grid conditions. Elsewhere, our plans include a filing midyear for our JCP&L customers under the New Jersey's Infrastructure Investment program and we anticipate a rate case filing in Maryland during the second half of the year. Now I will turn it over to Steve, who joins us for the first time in his new role as Chief Financial Officer for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments. Steven E. Strah: Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to join you today. Before we discuss first quarter results, I have a couple of housekeeping items to discuss with regard to our presentation of earnings. First, substantially all of the operations that previously comprised our Competitive Energy Services segment are now presented as discontinued operations in our other -- in our corporate and other segment for both 2018 and 2017, and are excluded from our operating earnings as a special item. This resulted from the deconsolidation of FES and FENOC, the completed sale of AE Supply's gas plants and the pending asset purchase agreements for the sale of Bath County Hydroelectric and Bay Shore plants. The remaining competitive business activities which were primarily related to AE Supply's Pleasants plan are included in the corporate and other for reporting purposes. As we will discuss later, there was some impact from Pleasants in our first quarter earnings, but we expect its results to be flat for the year. Second, as we mentioned in February, all of our operating results and projections are being presented on a fully diluted basis. This includes showing the equity issued in January as fully converted or approximately 538 million shares, and excluding the impacts of preferred dividends. We believe this is the best way to provide you with a comparative view of our performance. Reconciliations for items along with other detailed information about the quarter are available in our consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our Web site. As Chuck mentioned, our first quarter GAAP earnings of $2.55 per share included a $1.2 billion gain from the deconsolidation of FES, its subsidiaries and FENAC. These results compared to a first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share. On an operating earnings basis, first quarter earnings were $0.67 per share compared to $0.52 in the first quarter of 2017 on a fully diluted basis and reflecting only the continuing operations of our regulated distribution, regulated transmission, and corporate other segments. In the Distribution segment, operating results increased $0.15 per share primarily as the result of colder weather this year as compared to 2017, the impact of new rates that went into effect in Pennsylvania in late 2017 -- I'm sorry, in late January of 2017, as well as the Ohio DCR. Heating-degree-days were normal for the first quarter, but 17% higher than the same period of 2017. This drove a 5% increase in total distribution deliveries compared with the first quarter of 2017, including an 8% increase in residential sector and a 3% increase in commercial sales. On a weather adjusted basis, first quarter residential deliveries were down less than 1%, while commercial deliveries were slightly up. Looking at industrial sales, the positive trend continued for the first quarter with growth of nearly 3% compared to that of last year, driven by the shale gas and steel sectors. This marks the 7th consecutive quarterly increase in industrial sales. In the Transmission business, first quarter operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base in MAIT and ATSI due to our continued investment in the Energizing the Future program, as well as higher revenues at JCP&L from the FERC settlement that Chuck mentioned earlier. At our Corporate and Other segment, first quarter results reflect the higher interest expense and the lower tax shield. This was partially offset by higher commodity margin at Pleasants, primarily due to higher wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2018, but as I mentioned earlier, we're expecting its earnings contribution to be neutral for the year as compared to 2017. I will also note that we continue to expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be about 27% -- I\u2019m sorry, 28% for the year. Finally, we continue to receive questions about our approach to passing tax reform savings to customers, so I'll take a moment to discuss this process. Let me reiterate that for our guidance for 2018 does not include any benefit of taxes. On January 1, we began deferring these amounts as a regulatory liability until we work through the regulatory process in each of our jurisdictions. This is a complex issue that will be addressed uniquely in each regulatory jurisdiction. We have already implemented the tax change for the DMR and DCR in Ohio where we filed proactively to lower the rate to reflect the impact of tax reform saving customers nearly $40 million. Our Ohio utilities also filed comments that base rate distribution rates are not impacted by the Tax Act changes, because they\u2019re frozen through May of 2024. In Pennsylvania, we estimate that the combined net annual effect of the tax rate will be about $116 million across our four utilities. Our companies filed comments presenting arguments that single issue rate-making was not appropriate and provided support for implementing a reconcilable rider to be in effect 90 days of the final commission order. The PUC issued an order making all rates, including rider rates temporary as of March 15, 2018 for six months potentially the earliest date that the PUC would go back for tax savings. JCP&L reduced rates by $28.6 million on April 1, 2018 to reflect the tax rate change. These interim rates are subject to final BPU review and the BPU is expected to make a decision regarding treatment of excess deferred taxes going forward by July 1. JCP&L is seeking authority to continue to defer regulatory liability the impact of tax reform during the BPU proceeding until the next base rate case. In West Virginia, Mon Power and Potomac Edison will file testimony by May 30, proposing the treatment of tax reform related savings. And in Maryland, while the estimated Tax Act impact would be approximately $7 million to $8 million annually for customers, Potomac Edison will file a base rate case in the third quarter of 2018 where the benefits of tax reform will be realized by customers through a lower rate increase than would be otherwise have been necessary. On the transmission side, FERC issued a show cause order directing Mon Power, West Penn, and Potomac Edison and 45 others utilities on stated rates to propose revisions to those rates effective March 21, 2018 to reflect the changes in the federal corporate tax rate. JCP&L was not included on the list of stated rate transmission utilities required to file likely because the settlement at JCP&L's recent transmission rate case already took into account and addressed many tax impacts. ATSI, MAIT, TrAILCo, and PATH with adjust rates as part of the normal annual true-up process. We will continue to work with the regulatory commissions in each of our jurisdictions to determine the appropriate approach for our customers. Thank you for your time. Now let's take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Fleishman : Hi. Good morning. Charles E. Jones: Hey, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Hi. So just a couple questions on the -- with respect to the agreement, could you give us a sense of -- I think you said majority of creditors, just any more specifics of percent of creditor support and any kind of known opposition that we should anticipate? Charles E. Jones: Well, I can't give you specifics on the percentages of total creditors. I can tell you this, 100% of the creditors that were in these ad hoc groups have signed on to both agreements. And so there was no opposition within the ad hoc groups and they\u2019ve as I said in my remarks, committed to work with us to get all the other signatories on by June 15. Steven Fleishman : Okay, great. And then on the -- just on the overall -- I know you mentioned your overall plan is still the same in terms of earnings per share growth and equity. Maybe just a little more color on kind of how your credit metrics look and you said the credit agencies should be positive, any more color on their reaction to this? Charles E. Jones: Well, we will let them speak for themselves, Steve. But I would tell you this. We\u2019ve reviewed the settlement with both of them, which led to my comments about my belief that it will be credit positive. The metrics themselves are going to evolve as we move through this process. I think that we expect to be well within the guidelines of both -- all of the major rating agencies. Steven Fleishman : Okay, great. Congratulations. Charles E. Jones: Thanks, Steve. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead with your -- with Bank Of America. Please go ahead with your questions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. Congratulations. Charles E. Jones: Thanks, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. So, perhaps to follow-up on Steve's question a little bit more precisely, can you comment a little bit on the credit positive nature of this with respect to where exactly pro forma for the settlement, your FFO to debt ends up through the forecast period and how you see this changing versus your prior expectations? It would seem that largely the tax note and the 225 here would be the two key items to watch in terms of the evolution, but let me know your thoughts? James F. Pearson: Hey Julien, this is Jim. Let me jump in here. When we get out into our planning period post emergence, we see our credit metrics being solidly in the 12% to 13% range, which is well above S&P and the Moody's threshold. So we feel very good about that. On the second point, yes, you're right, we have the $225 million plus the $628 million tax note that we talked about, but that was well within the parameters of our planning period. As you see, the tax note $628 million, that's not due until December 31, 2022, which is essentially financing, which will be at the risk free treasury rate that\u2019s prevailing at the time of emergence, so that will have what I would say a minimal impact on our FFO. So, all in all, it is well within the guidelines of what our plan was and we feel still very confident that we're going to be within that range. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just with respect to Ohio, New Jersey, you alluded to upcoming infrastructure filings et cetera. How do you feel about being within the range or the distribution CapEx range you talked about earlier, and if you were to get these filings where would that put you, just to kind of make sure we're in the same zip code? James F. Pearson: If we would get what\u2019s in Ohio and New Jersey, I would suggest that that would probably put us in the upper end. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you both. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Hi. Just a quick one first, this date of June 15, is there any particular significance to that as part of the bankruptcy process or is that just a date that you're targeting? Charles E. Jones: No, it's just a target date. There is no significancy, but clearly this agreement in principle is a major step forward, and hopefully we can get the rest of the creditors onto it also. Jonathan Arnold : But does the agreement hold if you don\u2019t achieve that by June 15? Charles E. Jones: Yes. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So there's no particular time frame whereby you would have to resolve to keep this agreement intact or is there \u2026? Charles E. Jones: No. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then just separately on that, I wanted to revisit the tax slide, you are saying you haven't included anything in guidance for -- as a benefit from tax reform. Am I right in what you then said that you do have the benefit of the lower tax rate in Ohio where you have the rate freeze, but you consider that to be part of the freeze and therefore it\u2019s not a benefit per se, so you aren't deferring that piece or I just want to make sure I understand that right. James F. Pearson: Jonathan, we\u2019re deferring everything at this point. So we\u2019re also deferring that in Ohio, and as Steve and Chuck have mentioned earlier, we're not going to make any adjustments to those deferrals until we have what I would say final authorization from all the Commissions. Jonathan Arnold : So guidance and first quarter earnings then also -- both of those defer the Ohio piece as well as everything else? James F. Pearson: That's correct. Charles E. Jones: That\u2019s correct. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thanks for clarifying that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Gregory Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Charles E. Jones: Hi, Greg. Gregory Gordon : So just a couple of follow-ups, pretty thorough questions so far. The $810 million in pension and postretirement and other costs, that number as of your most recent update was closer to $1 billion. I just want to make sure that that\u2019s lower as a function in part of the pension funding exercise you guys did with the -- part of the equity raise earlier this year or are there other aspects of that change that are not associated with that? James F. Pearson: You know, Greg, I think we\u2019ve always been pretty consistent that the pension and other post employment benefits would be in about [ph] the $800 million range and that that's made up of the pension executive deferred comp, banked vacation as well as a little bit of our long-term incentive program. I think probably -- we also incorporated some guarantees in there, which was about a $140 million, so that gets you right to your $1 billion range. Gregory Gordon : Okay, my bad. Sorry about that. Second question, as I look at the terms of this deal, new money to the FES creditors is about $225 million, you got the tax note, you\u2019re transferring Pleasants. So other than the opportunity for you guys to participate in the value of the bonds, if they agree ultimately to more than $0.60 on the dollar, this is sort of definitively a clean break with FES with you having some optionality if they get recovery above $0.60, is that a fair summary? Charles E. Jones: I think that\u2019s a very fair summary. I think you got it figured out. Gregory Gordon : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hi, how are you doing? Charles E. Jones: Good, Paul. Paul Patterson : Greg sort of asked my question. I guess, just to make sure, so after the emergence of bankruptcy, do you expect any ongoing support in terms of employee benefits or anything else to be going to -- for FirstEnergy Corp. to be providing any assistance or cash payments to the generation company? Charles E. Jones: No. What\u2019s -- the entire arrangement will be done through this settlement process with the creditors and that will be it. We deconsolidated the books on the filing of FES, and we don't intend to provide anymore support to that part of the business, other than we've agreed to provide some shared services support through the restructuring process, some governmental affairs support through the restructuring process. Those all will be reimbursed by FES. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi guys. Just wanted to clarify on earnings, the 6% to 8% earnings growth, that\u2019s still off of the earnings excluding the DMR, so the -- like 2018, 2.15, is that right? Charles E. Jones: Correct. Praful Mehta : Got you. And then secondly, in terms of parent debt. I saw that the parent debt came down a little bit, I think $6.6 billion versus $7 billion, $7.2 billion last release. Just wanted to check is there anything specific that happen at the parent level in terms of deleveraging? James F. Pearson: No, there isn't, Praful. I know that the parent level when we issued the equity, we took out some of the term notes, but that should've been the extent of it. Our short-term debt probably went up in the range of above $1 billion, may be a little more than that, that\u2019s associated with the $500 million pension contribution we made. Also the revolving credit facility was drawn down by $500 million because FES drew that down and then we had about $300 and some million of storm cost. But I would say that\u2019s what the primary changes are in any type of our consolidated parent debt is. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thanks. And that level is expected to remain at this level or is there any plan in the near-term to kind of pay it down or borrow further as needed? James F. Pearson: I would say over the planning period that\u2019s going to stay about in that range. Praful Mehta : Great. Thanks, guys. James F. Pearson: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. James F. Pearson: Good morning. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to just touch based on current level of costs and just as you think about -- I know you\u2019ve been working on cutting costs, but is there any further potential as we think about your cost structure at the parents or otherwise, just what should we be thinking about in terms of initiatives or potential further cuts there? James F. Pearson: Well, Stephen, I think the way to think about it we started the process of what we call FE Tomorrow about a year-ago. We have been already over the last year implementing changes to the parent in anticipation of this restructuring process. We are going to -- we are not going to disclose dollar for dollar what we're doing here and there. I don't think that that's in our best interest to try to do that. I can just tell this, we're committed to resizing our corporate center to match the operations that we're going to have in a manner that that makes sense that we can give full recovery of those cost as we move forward as a regulated business. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And, Chuck, just at a high level, you\u2019re generally encouraged by sort of the progress that you\u2019ve been making in terms of that cost-cutting efforts? Charles E. Jones: Yes, I'm very encouraged. And I think we set some targets that I'm confident we are going to meet and I\u2019m also confident we\u2019re going to exceed those targets. You'll see the impact on it as we deliver on the growth rates that we projected. Stephen Byrd : That's great. And then shifting gears just on the tax note, the $628 million, I know that\u2019s basically sized to equal the cash tax benefit that you're going to realize. But I guess is it fair to say, I guess, your view is you would realize those benefits before the note is due in payables. In other words you will benefit from that cash flow and then ultimately you will need to pay that note off. But it's really designed to think up ultimately, but I would guess maybe some of that cash might come to FE before the maturity of the note, is that fair or how should we think about that? Charles E. Jones: Yes, Stephen, that\u2019s correct. We could receive those funds prior to that. And the note also allows us to pay that off early without any penalty if we so decided. Stephen Byrd : Okay, perfect. And then just lastly, just on one element of the agreement in principle, I think there's a provision where FirstEnergy could share in recoveries. I was thinking about to the extent that there is federal support for baseload generation with those kinds of support payments be something that potentially FE could be sharing in or that be excluded? Charles E. Jones: I would say that that\u2019s potentially something we could share in, but I just wanted to be really clear. We're highly motivated to get support for those generating assets because it would be a mistake for our country for them to close. The communities and employees are -- have the biggest concern there. As of a couple weeks ago, we have no remaining commercial interest in these generating facilities other than potentially what you just referred to in the settlement with creditors. I\u2019m going to keep fighting for support for those plants, because it's the right thing to do. If it gets to the point where it exceeds the threshold that we\u2019ve got in this agreement with creditors, then, yes, we would share some of that, but that's not why we\u2019re doing it. Stephen Byrd : Understood. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Congrats on today's announcement. I know it's been little bit of a long road, but you made a lot of progress, so kudos. One question about the new -- a follow-up on the nuclear plants though. Does this mean that the creditor group if the plants actually retire as announced, then FE Corp. doesn't maintain any of the liability associated with the retirement cost, meaning the decommissioning cost, the dry cask storage and that that would all fall to the new owners of the plants? Charles E. Jones: That's correct. Michael Lapides : Okay. I appreciate that. One other thing, just looking -- and this is on the distribution business and this is more of a housekeeping item. It look like O&M was up a good bit year-over-year. I don't know if I\u2019m misreading that or is that all stuff that just gets passed through in revenues one for one as well? Just wanted to see and maybe check that. Jason J. Lisowski: Hey, Michael. This is Jason Lisowski, Chief Accounting Officer. Actually the O&M cost is actually a benefit year-over-year. There was about $0.05 benefit and a lot of that is through the pension OPEB cost being reduced, because of the higher asset return and the contribution made back in January. Michael Lapides : Got it. I may have misread that, I will follow-up with you guys offline. Once again, congratulations guys. Charles E. Jones: It's nice to get a distribution question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Yes. Chuck, not being the expert in bankruptcy that you have reluctantly become, Exhibit A in the term sheet that was filed in the 8-K this morning. I just want to make sure my reading of that is correct. All that does is memorialize the Mansfield leaseholders as unsecured creditors of FES to the tune of, what $787 million, no obligation there to FE, correct? Charles E. Jones: Correct. Charles Fishman : That's the only question I have. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your questions. Shar, your line is live. Please check if you\u2019re muted. Shahriar Pourreza : Sorry about that. Good morning, guys. Charles E. Jones: Hi, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza : Just let me ask you -- most of my questions were answered, but on the tax note, there was -- in one of the terms of the draft, there was some language of the tax note can be somewhat mitigated if there is a sale or partial sale of the fossil or nuclear assets. Does that sort of potentially also relate, is there a process in place whether the decommissioning activities could be up for sale and how does that sort of work with the tax note? James F. Pearson: What that means from that tax note is if they were to, say, sell the plant or deactivate that and FE pays them through the intercompany tax sharing agreement and in turn our work with stock deduction is reduced, that's really what that's intended to mitigate. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, got it. So it's not related to potential sale of the decommissioning activities as you shut the plants down? James F. Pearson: No. Shahriar Pourreza : Is there a process in place to sell the decommissioning activities? Charles E. Jones: You would have to talk to the creditors and FES about that one. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, great. And then, Chuck, let me ask you a distribution question. So as you sort of think about tax reform and I know some of the stuff has been deferred, but as you sort of think about like the accumulated deferred income tax balance that you guys have, have you guys sort of thought about or have you broken out how much of that is sort of protected versus unprotected? And as you sort of think about the unprotected portion, is there an opportunity sort of credit that back sooner than later and potentially look at higher rate base opportunities? James F. Pearson: I would be lying to you if I said I was an expert in that field, which I\u2019m not. I know we had a question on that before the unprotected piece is relatively insignificant at this point, so we haven't focused much attention on that at this point. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, great. Congrats, guys. My questions were answered. Thanks. James F. Pearson: Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead with your questions. Angieszka Storozynski : Thank you. So I have a question on this 6% to 8% EPS CAGR, so that was issued before. You knew how much money you will need to really settle with FES creditors, so now we\u2019ve a sense. So can you give me an idea if there's any potential offset to those incremental costs associated with the settlement? And hence I\u2019m roughly in the same place within that range and if not what is basically driving the difference between the 6% to 8% in that range? Thank you. Charles E. Jones: So, Angie, when we gave you that 6% to 8% in February, we're already in the middle of discussions with creditors and built into that our assumptions about what the cost to reach an agreement might be. So it's already included in the 6% to 8% and there's no need to adjust for it at this time. Angieszka Storozynski : So the delta -- so the 6% to 8% is just purely a function of O&M attrition fees and CapEx or maybe low growth as well? Charles E. Jones: There's no delta to the 6% to 8%. Angieszka Storozynski : No, no, I understand. What I\u2019m trying to say is what could gave me an 8% EPS CAGR versus a 6% EPS CAGR? What\u2019s the biggest driver here? Charles E. Jones: More investments such as the distribution platform, modernization in Ohio or the infrastructure investment in New Jersey. More investment would be what would drive us towards the top end. Angieszka Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Actually, Chuck, I\u2019m going to make your day, I\u2019m going to ask you more questions about the distribution business. Can we go to the appendix please, the slide I think it's 23 where you talk a little bit about Pennsylvania and the slide before that when you talk about Ohio. In Pennsylvania, you've got two utilities that are earning healthy ROEs into utilities that look like they\u2019re under earning. What\u2019s the trajectory and plan to fix the ones that are under earning? James F. Pearson: Yes, I would say from our standpoint, Michael, what we always do is we look at what our projected capital investments are going to be as well as what load growth or degradation will be and then we'll sit back and make a decision whether we should go in for a filing. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve got a couple of utilities that have a slightly higher ROEs that doesn\u2019t allow us to have the DISC recovery at this point in time. But there is some additional expenditures that are starting to flow through there, that\u2019s going to bring them back down within the -- I think below the 9.5% range or whatever to that. But I would say we universally look at all of our distribution companies, what our plan spend is, what our expected revenues and returns are, and then we make a decision on whether we should go in for a rate proceeding and I think you can see that magnified in what we\u2019re going to do in Maryland. We're planning on making a filing at the latter part of this year and there's -- that's the way we approach it. But just \u2026 Michael Lapides : Got it. And \u2026 James F. Pearson: \u2026 that\u2019s slightly below -- we don\u2019t make a decision to go in immediately and get into what I'd say rate fatigue. We strategically look at what is the optimal timing on when to make those filings. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then a more -- may be more strategic kind of question. We had three or four years in this industry among regulated companies including an announcement made today of M&A occurring where companies are able to cut costs via M&A. Those costs eventually flow back to customers via the rate case process somewhere down the road, makes companies more efficient. Just curious once you get FES result and it looks like it's happening sooner rather than later. How you think about the landscape for M&A and what FirstEnergy's role in that landscape, if any. Charles E. Jones: So we\u2019re a product of three of those types of events. And I am proud to say that when you benchmark our O&M costs across all of our utilities, they benchmark very well against our competition. I would think that the synergies of those transactions have helped us achieve that. The end result of that is that we have pretty much lower, the lowest rates in the states that we serve. So we\u2019ve given the benefit of those transactions to our customers. I\u2019m a little tentative when you think about M&A type of things today because of the premium cost and the high cost to achieve from a regulatory perspective makes it difficult to deliver dividends to customers in the short-term. I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves now with 6 million customers across five states. That 6% to 8% growth on top of -- an appropriate dividend policy is going to be a good story for our investors for a long time to come. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated, guys. Charles E. Jones: Okay. Well, thank you for your questions and your time and thank you as always for your support. I think this was an important call for us as we move forward, and we'll talk to you in next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thanks, Sherry. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with a presentation which supports today\u2019s discussion. Participants in today\u2019s call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Jones : Thanks, Irene, and welcome, everyone. Hot weather and strong operational performance across our company led to great second quarter results. Our earnings exceeded the guidance we provided to the investment community and I remain very proud of our FirstEnergy team\u2019s record of consistently meeting or exceeding the estimates we have provided to you over the last three-and-a-half years. We\u2019re entering the second half of the year with tremendous momentum on our customer focused regulated growth strategy. Looking at the balance of the year, we are currently tracking near the upper end of our 2018 operating earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share and we are pleased to affirm that range today. For the third quarter, we are introducing an operating earnings guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. We\u2019re also affirming our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. This includes the impact of the amended settlement agreement and the FES bankruptcy case to include the FES and unsecured creditors committee. This final comprehensive settlement defines and quantifies all of FirstEnergy\u2019s obligations with respect to FES and FENOC and as a milestone development as we move forward as a fully regulated company. I will touch on the significant updates to the April agreement and principle. You can find more details on these items along with other non-economic terms in the appendix of the Quarterly Highlights Presentation that is published on our website. First, we will provide a credit for nine months of the 2018 shared services cost on behalf of FES above to $112.5 million. In addition, we have agreed to extend the right for FES to purchase shared services from the end of this year to June 30, 2020. Second, we have increased the cash payment by $88 million. And third, we have agreed to cover certain FES the employee benefit related cost with an expected value of $18 million including a voluntary enhanced retirement program if offered by FES. In terms of timing, we expect FES to file the agreement with the bankruptcy court by the end of August for approval in September. Reaching the settlement only four short months after the bankruptcy filing is a tremendous accomplishment and it represents an outstanding effort by a restructuring working group and everyone else involved. In addition, by completing this effort squarely in mid-2018, we are fulfilling the commitment we made to you when we announced our timing to exit competitive markets. With the resolution of this milestone step in the bankruptcy process for FirstEnergy, we look forward to entering 2019 with our focus on the continued successful implementation of our regulated growth strategies. Let\u2019s switch gears and discuss our second quarter results and other developments. In our distribution business, weather was the dominant driver but it wasn\u2019t the only positive development. In our Residential segment, we saw growth in both customer count and weather adjusted usage in the second quarter and we are hopeful these results signal an improving economy in our service territory. We also continue to see growing demand from our industrial customers, with their electric usage increasing by 2% marking the eight consecutive quarter of growth in that customer class. Turning to regulatory activity. In New Jersey, severe coastal weather systems and Nor'Easters are a difficult reality for our JCP&L customers as well as our utility infrastructure. Recently our JCP&L team conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution system and assess lessons learned from restorations efforts following severe weather events. From that analysis, we developed JCP&L Reliability Plus an infrastructure investment plan that is designed to improve customer service by reducing that frequency and duration of power outages for our New Jersey customers, particularly those related to severe weather. This four year, $400 million plan was filed with the BTU last month. These targeting incremental investments include nearly 4,000 enhancements to help the reliability and resiliency of JCP&L\u2019s overhead and underground distribution lines. New equipment to minimize outages and additional tree work to reduce the impact of storms. We requested BTU approval by the end of the year. In Maryland, later this month, we plan to file the first base rig case for Potomac Edison in nearly 25 years. The request will address the impact of federal tax reform on customer rates as well as recovery of investments made in our Maryland distribution system to ensure continued safe and reliable service. In Ohio, our application for a $450 million distribution platform modernization fan is pending at the PUCO. As we have discussed, the three year plan seeks approval to redesign and modernize portions of our distribution system which will help our Ohio utilities restore power faster, strengthen the system against adverse weather conditions, and enhance system performance by allowing remote monitoring of real-time grid conditions. In our transmission business, in May, FERC approved our settlement agreement establishing a forward-looking formula rate for MAIT, with an implementation date for new rates of July 1. Our customer-focused Energizing the Future program is driving significant improvements in the performance of our transmission infrastructure. Since 2014, we have completed between 600 and 700 transmission projects per year. These have been focused on upgrading or replacing aging infrastructure, building a smarter, more secure transmission system and adding operational flexibility, so grid operators can quickly adjust to changing conditions in the grid. We have replaced or rebuilt more than 1200 miles of transmission miles across our service territory and we have a rigorous process in place to continue identifying projects that can reduce transmission outages and enhance reliability for our customers. In four years since we\u2019ve launched this program, these efforts have resulted in a 37% reduction in transmission equipment related outages in our ATSI zone, which services our Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating, and Toledo Edison utilities in Ohio, as well as Penn Power customers in Western Pennsylvania. We remain on track to invest more than $1.1 billion dollars this year on transmission upgrades, growing to $1.2 billion dollars per year from 2019 through 2021. As we continue expanding the program eastward, we fully expect to achieve similar results in our MAIT region, which encompasses our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas in Pennsylvania. In addition to our strong progress in these regulated growth strategies, we are making headway in our efforts to align our cost structure and workforce for the future, through our FE Tomorrow initiative. In June, we offered voluntary severance and early retirement packages to approximately 600 employees, predominately in our Shared Services organization, which in-groups such as IT, communications, finance, and legal. The offers were accepted by nearly 500 individuals. These employees will begin departing this month, with most retiring by the end of the year. In addition, in July we extended the retirement package to eligible members of our executive team, with Jim Pearson & Leila L. Vespoli both accepting their offers. Leila will retire on April 1, 2019 and Jim will retire no later than that date. I\u2019d like to personally thank Jim, Leila, and all the other employees who are retiring from our company for the many valuable contributions they\u2019ve made over their careers. These departures roll into our FE Tomorrow initiative where we continue our work to identify the optimal organization and properly align our corporate costs and systems to support our efficient, regulated growth company going forward. While we don\u2019t have any financial projections related to FE Tomorrow to share with you yet, we expect that the initiative will offset the nearly $30 million related to depreciation for common systems shared with FES, which we previously disclosed in our guidance. We expect to be in a position to provide more details on these activities during our third quarter call. But a great first half of the year, and we are committed to executing the plan we\u2019ve already laid out. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve for a review of the quarter and other financial developments. Steven Strah : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported very strong second quarter results. Our GAAP earnings were $0.28 per share and our operating earnings were $0.62 per share. This succeeded the top end of our second quarter guidance. As a reminder, to provide you with a comparative view of our performance, we continue to present all of our operating results and projections on a fully-diluted basis in light of the January equity issuance. This allows us to show all of the preferred shares as fully converted and excludes the impact of conversion timing. While it does not impact our presentation, I\u2019ll note that preferred shareholders did begin to convert these shares in July. You can find reconciliations and other detailed information about our results in the second quarter consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our website. Before we move into operating earnings drivers, I\u2019d like to point out a couple additional special items. First our GAAP results include costs associated with the redemption of long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company. You\u2019ll recall that we used the proceeds from the sale of the Bath hydroelectric plant, which closed during the quarter, and the earlier sale of gas-fired plants to redeem this debt. And second, GAAP earnings results include a $0.17 per share benefit related to two regulatory actions. The first of those actions, FERC approved a settlement that reallocated previously incurred costs of certain transmission projects across utilities in PJM which will result in a refund to our Ohio utilities. This benefited our second-quarter GAAP earnings by 10%. The second action. In the wake of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding costs incurred to secure renewable energy credits in Ohio, we recognized a $0.07 per share benefit from the reversal of a reserve recorded in 2013. I\u2019ll note that the accrued carrying charges on the balance were also reserved -- reversed but were not included as a special item because that expense was always part of our operating earnings. This appears as a $0.03 per share benefit to operating earnings in our Distribution business and was not part of our original guidance. Now moving on to other key operating earnings drivers in our Distribution business. Earnings benefited by $0.09 per share from stronger distribution revenues associated with higher weather-related usage, increased industrial load, and a true-up of previous deferrals resulting from rate orders that were issued in the second quarter of 2018. Cool temperatures in April followed by hot weather in May and June resulted in a 4% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to last year\u2019s mild second quarter. Sales to residential customers increased 8.6% while commercial deliveries increased 1.6%. Heating degree days were 33% higher than the second quarter of 2017 and 5% above normal while cooling degree days were 22% higher than 2017 and 30% above normal. On a weather-adjusted basis commercial sales were down 1.4% but residential sales were up 1.4%. As Chuck said, we saw growth in both residential customer count and weather-adjusted average usage. We are cautious about reading too much into the short-term improvements but nonetheless we\u2019re encouraged by these results. Another bright spot is the industrial sector where deliveries increased 2%. We have now recorded eight consecutive quarters of sales growth with a one year growth rate of 2.3%. In our Transmission business earnings continued to benefit from our Energizing the Future investment program including a higher rate base at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries and higher revenues at JCP&L. And in our Corporate segment, second quarter results reflects slightly higher interest and operating expense. This was offset by increased commodity margin at the Pleasants Power Station driven by higher wholesale prices due to hot weather this quarter. We continue to expect the earnings contribution from Pleasants to be insignificant for the year. I\u2019d also like to share this brief update on where we stand with regard to passing tax reform savings onto customers. As you know, on January 1, we began deferring the full amount into each jurisdiction as a net regulatory liability as we work through the regulatory process. In our utilities, we delivered customer savings in New Jersey on April 1 and in Pennsylvania on July 1. In Maryland, we plan to address tax reform in the upcoming rig case filing. In Ohio, we delivered customer savings related to various writers and we continue to work with regulators in both Ohio and West Virginia to determine next steps regarding the balance of tax reform. In our Transmission business at ATSI, TrAIL, and MAIT, rates will automatically be lowered in connection with the normal formula rate process. And for the Allegheny transmission assets, we filed a proposed 6.7% reduction to stated transmission rates during the second quarter which is pending before FERC. We\u2019ll need to keep you updated on our progress. So clearly, we\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance and operating performance during the quarter for the first half of the year. We\u2019re making excellent progress on our commitments to the investment community and the implementation of our regulated strategies. And we\u2019re positioning our company for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth to benefit our shareholders, customers and employees. So I do want to make a correction. The special item related to the FERC settlement helped our GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share. I misspoke when I said 10%. My apologies. Thank you for your time. And now let\u2019s take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and on the settlement. Charles Jones : Thanks, Greg. Greg Gordon : You reiterated your short and long-term earnings guidance notwithstanding the increase in the agreed-upon remediation to the debtors and the creditors at FES. You know is it that there\u2019s some offsetting aspects of better performance in your core business that eat through that potential incremental cash out flow? Or is it just simply that it\u2019s bounded by the range that you\u2019ve already articulated? Charles Jones : I would say it\u2019s just simply bounded by the range that we already had articulated, Greg. Greg Gordon : Okay. Thanks. My second question is a bit off the beaten path, but I think pretty important. You\u2019re going to be cleaned up sort of across the Rubicon [ph] here on separating from FES later this year. The dividend was cut from $2.20 a share to $1.44 a share several years ago. It\u2019s been unchanged since then. The payout ratio I\u2019m looking at on your earnings growth aspirations would seem to indicate there was some opportunity for consideration of resuming some type of dividend growth. At what point will you bring to the Board for their consideration a change in the dividend policy? Charles Jones : I think as we get this separation done, I will be having conversations with the Board. But I think it\u2019s too early to go there. But clearly I think if we\u2019re going to be expected to be valued as a fully regulated company, we\u2019re going to have to have a dividend policy that matches what other fully regulated companies do in the very near future. Greg Gordon : Okay. So not right away, but at some point in the near future? Charles Jones : So that would get this FES fully behind us, which we \u2013 this was a huge milestone, and it gives us the ability to now quantify what the fully regulated company looks like going forward. And that puts me in a position to have more meaningful discussions with the Board than we were able to have up until now. Greg Gordon : Thank you, Chuck. Didn\u2019t mean to put the cart before the horse, but just getting a little excited on you resolving all this stuff. Take care. Charles Jones : We\u2019re excited too. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. Charles Jones : Hey, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : I just wanted to touch on you FE Tomorrow update, very positive update. Again, maybe this falls on the cart before the horse category too but you mentioned in your remarks that you expect the initiative would offset the $30 million in depreciation for common systems. As you look at the scope of possibilities around continued cost cuts, is that the general ballpark level we should be thinking about or is there a series of initiatives that could significantly exceed that $30 million? Charles Jones : Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say. We started planning for this exit over a year ago with that feed tomorrow. We had a lot of that groundwork done in advance. We\u2019ve obviously implemented this voluntary early retirement program to facilitate that. We\u2019re working through re-designing our entire corporate structure to fit what we need to be a regulated utility business going forward. That\u2019s a work in progress. It\u2019s going to result in savings but we\u2019re not ready to communicate what that total amount means and how it\u2019s going to look going forward. Internally, there are lots of people involved and we\u2019re taking into account the feelings and emotions and everything else that goes into what we\u2019re putting this corporate structure through right now. At the appropriate time, we\u2019ll tell you what the financial impacts are. Stephen Byrd : Totally understood. And then at a high level just thinking about your financing plan, you\u2019ve laid out some incremental CapEx opportunity so I just wanted to level set and check in again in terms of just making sure I understand how you would approach financing incremental CapEx needs to the extent that you do get approval? Steven Strah : Steve, this is Steve Strah. So from a financing plan perspective, we would use internally generated cash flow as well as debt issued at the utility. So we have no incremental equity needs through our planning period through 2021. Stephen Byrd : Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Chris Turnure : I appreciate the details on the tax reform process especially in the appendix that you provided today but I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the process in Ohio right now where you stand on the tax benefits outside of the writers and if you\u2019re deferring them currently and what the next steps are. Steven Strah : This is Steve. Thanks for the question. We continue to work with regulators and staff in Ohio. We are currently deferring the full impact of the number of tax savings dollars there beyond the writers that we\u2019ve already trued-up. So we\u2019re working with them just as other utilities are working with them through the process. And once again, we\u2019re following the lead of regulators also in West Virginia, as an example, where we have filed as asked and we\u2019ll work through the process with them. Chris Turnure : And is the process in Ohio going kind of as you expected it to go at this point? Steven Strah : I think we\u2019re within the expectation level that we had. It\u2019s a two-way dialogue. It\u2019s very clear that we\u2019ve returned roughly $40 million through the writer process for the DMR and DCR writers. The remainder is to be worked out. Chris Turnure : Great. And then separately for the distribution business this quarter, I think you were clear that you guys did include a $0.03 benefit from the Ohio decision and adjusted EPS. But were there any other items that were nonrecurring or unusual in nature and adjusted EPS for the distribution business. And then I was also hoping you could quantify weather versus normal and a normalized load growth impact on an EPS basis as well. Steven Strah : There were no other onetime adjustments to the quarterly earnings. The weather impact was about $0.03 compared to last year. Chris Turnure : And did you guys have that on a versus normal basis as well? Steven Strah : The total weather adjusted experience that we had is roughly 1% above normal when you look at it on a year-to-date basis. Chris Turnure : Okay. But for the quarter specifically, we don\u2019t have the EPS impact of weather versus normal or normalized load growth versus normal? James Pearson : Yeah, Chris. This is Jim. We were about $0.03 to $0.04 higher associated with weather during the quarter. Steven Strah : This is Steve again. As I said in my open remarks, we had a cool April, but we had a very warm May and June that got us to that $0.03 number. Chris Turnure : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Claire Huang with Bank of America. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. I\u2019m slipping in for Julien here. James Pearson : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the great update. I just had two quick questions, not necessarily on FES here. The first is in terms of ROEs in Ohio. So they\u2019re trending upwards. Just wanted to confirm any details about the seat test and your thoughts there. James Pearson : So, as of this point in time, we have not even triggered the first threshold under the seat test. So, I think all is good with regard to ROEs in Ohio for the moment. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Got it. I know this is a little forward-looking, three is a change in the commission potentially with the election, just want to get your thoughts on the seat test going forward, if there\u2019s anything you can say now or this is much more far away of a topic. James Pearson : That is way forward-looking and I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s, I think probably there are some commissioner spots that are coming due next year but we have no idea who the governor is going to be at this point. It\u2019s too premature to even think about that. Steven Strah : With regard to the seat test, the seat test is statutory, so that is not something the commission is allowed to just ignore. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s fair. Okay. And then my second question is just, I noticed you didn\u2019t have any commentary on the nuclear assets. I know that since you guys are totally out of FES now, that it\u2019s not really related to your ongoing business, but just curious if you have any thoughts on support for those nuclear assets and your thoughts there. James Pearson : So, any thoughts around the future of those assets are now questions to be posed to FES. I would say that from my perspective, I continue to feel that that the market policies in our countries have severe flaws, that closing perfectly good nuclear plants in the long run is not going to be a good thing for our country. In the long run, it\u2019s not going to be a good thing for the six million customers that I\u2019m paid to look out for. Because I think you know having a diverse mix of generation provides the most secure future for those customers from both a physical security, grid resiliency, and an economic stability perspective. So, to the extent my voice matters in this process, I\u2019m going to continue to be a loud advocate for it. I do believe that the Department of Energy is still very seriously looking at this issue and we\u2019re hopeful that they intend, that they will eventually step forward and do something to stabilize it. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations to Jim and Leila. I want to quickly first follow up on the comment about no incremental equities through 2021. Was that meant to indicate that your internal cash flow and small inclement to leverage would be a limiting factor on CapEx? So, in other words if you were successful, it would be the approvals for the Ohio DPM, the New Jersey IIP, potentially some transmission projects. Would you not spend if you needed equity or would you raise equity if those opportunities came up? Steven Strah : This is Steve again. Our forecast, with or without, those capital programs, we would generate enough internally generated cash flow and be able to fund the difference in debt issued at our regulated companies. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarifying. Next one, given the strong start to the year so far and little bit of help from weather, do you see any opportunity to maybe accelerate from O&M from P19 into 2018. Is that part of why you didn\u2019t raise guidance for the full year? James Pearson : No, we didn\u2019t raise guidance for the full year because we\u2019re halfway through the year and a cold August and a warm December would result in reversing everything that we\u2019ve seen. So, I think I\u2019ve said before I\u2019m not going to take credit for good weather but I\u2019m also not going to plan on it either. So, you know, we are on track with our plan as we laid it out for 2018 with basically the only difference being the Supreme Court ruling and the weather in this quarter. Andrew Weisel : Understood. And lastly, just to clarify, given the progress made with FES and the settlements, should we think of the restricting working group as basically done at this point or is there anything more that they\u2019d be working on that we can be looking for to updates on? James Pearson : I would say you can think of it as basically done, but not done. We still have work to get definitive agreements in place and get the courts to approve it. But I\u2019m not planning to use the restructuring working group to advise me on anything but the bankruptcy. Andrew Weisel : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed. Charles Fishman : Good morning, Chuck. A couple years ago, when you first started your appeal about the importance of the three nuclear plants, you know notwithstanding the grid reliability, and resiliency issues. One of the arguments you made was that the closure of those facilities would require material investment in the transmission system. You now moved the upper end of your transmission guidance for 2019 through 2021. I think the guidance was just the unlocking the future slides this year, does that, have you started including anything in there or are you going to wait until we get closer to the retirement dates that FES has set or could that go higher I guess is my question. Charles Jones : I'll go first. I\u2019ve talked generically about the costs that are imposed on the transmission system when existing power plants close. Generally that\u2019s not around the nuclear plants though. The nuclear plants are very heavily networked as a result of the need to ensure multiple sources of off-site power for reactor coolant. So the nuclear plants themselves don\u2019t generate a lot transmission costs. I\u2019ve spoken about the costs we did incur when we closed the Lake plants and as well as costs that have occurred throughout the markets as other power plants have closed. But inside our plan we include all of the RTEP projects that PJM identifies for our footprint. And those go up and down each year but they are included within our plan. So I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any significant change from the $1.2 billion that we talked about over the next four years after this year. Charles Fishman : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Good morning. So just the shared services agreement with FES that you \u2013 they have a right to extend, is that something where it\u2019s pretty much done at your cost so you don\u2019t have to worry about \u2013 it\u2019s not an issue for FE if it\u2019s extended? Charles Jones : That is correct. Our financial ties to FES will end this year so that we can focus being a fully-regulated company starting in 2019. Any shared services that they may want after that they will pay for at the appropriate costs. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. And then just the Potomac Edison, what kind of returns \u2013 and I might have missed an answer in this but what kind of returns has that subsidiary been earning? Leila Vespoli : So that subsidiary, this is Leila, has been earning returns in the 5.6% range and so obviously rate case we are seeking to put that in a proper place, which is also the reason we are hoping to take care of the tax issue associated with that because we\u2019ve been underearning for a substantial period of time. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Praful Mehta with Citi Research. Please proceed. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Chuck Jones : Hi. Praful Mehta : So well congrats on further movement on the FES settlement. As that movement happens and as you clean up the purely regulated story, just want to understand from a strategic perspective how you\u2019re thinking about your story. Do you feel like you have the right size? Is there any need to increase or decrease operations? Just as I look at your portfolio today, your I guess portfolio post-FES, anything from a strategic direction perspective that we should be thinking about? Chuck Jones : From a strategic direction we\u2019re committing to 6% to 8% growth over the next four-year period and beyond that, there\u2019s nothing that I would comment on. I would just say any inquiries we would take seriously and look at and we\u2019re going to always do what\u2019s right for our shareholders but strategic plays for growth in this industry today are very complex especially if you take a company like ours where we have five regulatory jurisdictions so that would imply six or more likely regulatory jurisdictions. They\u2019re just very complex and right now I think we\u2019re just focused what we\u2019ve said. We\u2019ve had 6 million customers across five states, 10 distribution utilities, three transcos [ph] and now we\u2019re looking at how we deliver the value that our shareholders had been asking for from us starting in 2019 and then well into the future. Praful Mehta : Fair enough. That\u2019s good color but as you look at any opportunities that do come your way, how should we think about the criteria apart from obviously getting the right premium, the right returns for shareholders? Are there anything else that we should be thinking about as you kind of evaluate these opportunities? Chuck Jones : I have no comment, Praful. Praful Mehta : All right. Fair enough. I at least tried. I guess one more specific question on the economic lease of Pleasants. As a part of this restructured settlement, just wanted to get a little bit more color for this economic lease by FES or Pleasants beginning no later than January 2019. Can you just provide a little bit more color on that? Chuck Jones : It fulfills what I\u2019ve said earlier that starting in 2019 any financial exposure to the commodity markets is gone and the financial lease for Pleasants will move all of that to the FES creditors. Praful Mehta : Got you. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, just curious. How are you thinking about where you are in the transmission investment cycle? Meaning the $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion range. Do you kind of view that as kind of a long-run normalized run rate? Or do you think \u2013 and if you don\u2019t mind \u2013 maybe touch on the specific geographies. Is there an uptick coming in one of the geographies, a downtick coming in others? You talked a little bit about this over the years but just kind of curious trying to get your multiyear view on where transmission been hedged. Chuck Jones : For the next two years, it\u2019s going to be $1.2 billion. It was $1.1 billion this year and $1.2 billion for the next four years. We are moving it around our system. That\u2019s the clear benefit that we have of having a five-state territory with almost 25,000 miles of transmission. We can move it around. I\u2019ve talked about the benefits already at 37% reduction and equipment related outages on our ATSI system. That\u2019s a direct result of the investments we\u2019ve been making. We\u2019re now moving more into the make [ph] part of our system and I\u2019m sure down the road we\u2019ll look at the Allegheny transmission that is in currently still instated rates and see if it makes sense to move to a forward-looking transco [ph] for those. But I think for now, for the next four years, it\u2019s going to be $1.2 billion. We\u2019re doing 600 to 700 projects a year and we have to be cognizant of the execution risks. And as I\u2019ve talked before, there\u2019s not an unlimited workforce out there in our country today for transmission line and substation projects given that a lot of our other peers are focusing on this area too. Michael Lapides : Got it. And one quick follow-up. If you think about the next three to five years and what may be on your long-term regulatory wishlist, meaning is there a state in your various service territories where you think there\u2019s opportunities to upgrade or improve the regulatory mechanisms that would A, potentially increase investment in that state, distribution, whatever, and B, help reduce to the lag that impacts your company? Chuck Jones : Well I don\u2019t have anything specific to talk about but clearly we have a good track record of working our regulators to come up with different mechanisms other than traditional rate-based type of rate making. So whether those are writers or formulas or trackers in Pennsylvania. We have that as IIP in New Jersey as a helpful addition to how we do business there. We\u2019ve had the DCR in Ohio. And so anything that is [indiscernible] to investors so that you understand when we\u2019re making investments what the returns are for you. That is constructive for customers. And obviously if we can reduce flag [ph] all of those are goals that we would like to achieve. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from -- we do not have another question, I\u2019m sorry. Charles Jones : Okay. Well, thank you, all. As I said earlier, this settlement is a big milestone in our evolution to be in a fully regulated company. We thank you for support and I look forward to seeing you all in between now and the third quarter call and then talking to you again at the third quarter. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thanks, Melissa. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Jones : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. We had a great quarter, and I'm pleased to have this chance to speak with you about our results and our progress on key initiatives. Since our last call in August, we have successfully carried out several of the critical steps necessary to complete our transition to a fully regulated utility. As I'm sure you know, on September 25, the bankruptcy court approved our definitive settlement agreement in the Chapter 11 proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions, its subsidiaries and FENOC. This very positive development marks perhaps the most important milestone in our exit from competitive generation. While you may occasionally see news about the progress of FES, FENOC and their affiliates, as they work with the bankruptcy court. To be clear, we expect that none of this will impact our ability to execute our regulated strategy. We're also in the final stages of implementing our FE Tomorrow initiative, which will align our cost structure and shared services workforce to efficiently and effectively support our regulated businesses going forward. In total, 960 positions in our shared service organization were impacted by this effort. In addition to the nearly 500 employees, who accepted our voluntary enhanced retirement package, we eliminated nearly 230 open positions, transition some employees into opportunities in our utility business and created a flatter, leaner management structure by reducing layers and increasing spans of control. As part of this streamlining effort, there are nearly 45% fewer leadership positions in our shared services organization, including 46 Director, Executive Director and Vice President positions and 163 supervisory and manager level positions. The majority of these organizational changes went into effect during the third quarter. As part of the FE Tomorrow effort, our teams identified opportunities that will eliminate the $300 million of cost that were associated with our competitive operations. In addition, we expect to fully offset the $30 million of depreciation, associated with common systems shared with FES. We also identified an additional $20 million of O&M and interest, and $35 million in capital reductions for total incremental cash savings of $85 million. The expected savings include reductions in labor costs and less reliance on contractor work and will be reflected in the 2019 earnings guidance, we will provide at EEI next month. The FE Tomorrow initiative has been an outstanding effort by our teams across our corporate functions. In fact, a level of projected operating expenses associated with our shared services organization, benchmark solely within the top quartile of our industry. And we are confident that we have the proper organization and cost structure to support our fully regulated business. Past two years and this year, in particular, have been a period of rapid change in our company. I'm extremely proud of our employees' ability to remain focused on the execution of our objectives. As you saw in the results we posted last night, our regulated businesses continue to perform very well. We reported strong third quarter results and exceeded our guidance, largely due to the hot summer weather that is lingered through the end of September. We will discuss our earnings drivers in more detail, but we were very pleased that in addition to the benefits from the heat, we saw a second consecutive quarter of growth in residential weather adjusted usage. And at the same time, industrial usage was up 2.5% compared to the third quarter of 2017, marking the ninth quarter of growth in that class. On the regulatory front, we continue to execute on our plans. In August, we filed the first base rate case for Potomac Edison in Maryland in nearly 25 years. And this week, we supplemented the filing to update the partially forecasted test year with the full 12 months of actual data. The $19.7 million request addresses recovery of the investments we have made in our Maryland distribution system to ensure continued, safe and reliable service. The request is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform. The Maryland Public Service Commission provided a procedural schedule that includes evidentiary hearings beginning on January 22, we expect a final order by March 23. In Ohio, our application for our $450 million distribution platform modernization plan is pending at the PUCO. The three year plan would focus on distribution, automation, voltage control and preparing for the grid of the future. Now that the commission's powered forward initiative is complete, we believe the PUCO will be able to focus on the distribution platform, modernization proceeding and grid modernization issues. In New Jersey, our four year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan is pending at the BPU. As we discussed last quarter, this plan is designed to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of the distribution system for the benefit of our customers in New Jersey. We are hopeful that we will receive a procedural schedule soon to facilitate timely approval by the BPU. Finally, we continue to execute our energizing the future transmission plans across our footprint, and we remain on track to invest $1.1 billion in our system this year. Consistent with our eastward expansion this initiative, this summer, we completed the $51 million East Towanda-South Troy line rebuild project in Bradford County Pennsylvania. This project was as part of our mid-Atlantic interstate transmission subsidiary, involve rebuilding an existing 19.6-mile, 115-kilovolt transmission line using 230-kilovolt construction standards. The rebuild line was designed to allow further construction of the second 230-kilovolts circuit when needed in the future. Also in May, earlier this year, we finished rebuilding a 7.2-mile section of a 115-kilovolt line on an existing right away in Bradford County and South Central Pennsylvania. This will connect to a new 10.6-mile span of line that stretches into neighboring Somerset County. When this $50 million reliability project is complete in 2019, it will connect several substations and address the risk of thermal overloads and low-voltage conditions that could impact service reliability in that region. We've updated our full year 2018 GAAP earnings forecast to $1.68 to $2.60 per share, which reflects that deconsolidation and court-approved bankruptcy settlement with FES and FENOC and an estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments. With our strong performance and the impact of favorable weather through the first nine months of the year, we're raising and nearing our full year 2018 operating earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share from the previous range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We're also reaffirming our longer-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. Now Steve will provide a review of our strong third quarter results and our financial developments. Steven Strah : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. Our results are very straightforward for this quarter. So this will be a quick discussion with plenty of time for your questions. Starting with our GAAP results, yesterday, we reported a third quarter GAAP loss of $1.02 per share. This is due to a pretax charge of $1.2 billion, representing the expected obligations under our current agreement with FES and FENOC bankruptcy cases. And with the court's approval of that settlement, we moved the Pleasants Plant to discontinued operations to reflect its upcoming transfer to FES and excluded the plant from operating earnings starting in the third quarter. Before I move on to the discussion of operating earnings drivers, I'll remind you that we continue presenting operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis. This allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and it eliminates the impact of conversion timing. For your reference about 56% of preferred shares had been converted as of September 30. In accordance with the terms of the equity issuance, we expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be converted by the end of July, 2019. As always, we provide reconciliations and detailed information about the quarter and our consolidated report to the investment community, which is posted on our website. Our third quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share surpassed the top end of our guidance with weather driving the bulk of the $0.17 per share increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. Results in our distribution business benefited by higher deliveries along with lower expenses, lower financing cost and higher regulated commodity margin. These factors more than offset related - cost related to increased vegetation management work in Pennsylvania, higher depreciation expense and general taxes. Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 6.3% compared to the third quarter of 2017. This was largely due to cooling degree days that were 28% higher than last year and 29% above normal. Sales to residential customers increased 12.9%, while commercial deliveries were up 2.7%. On a weather adjusted basis, deliveries to commercial customers were down 0.7% compared to last year. The decrease primarily reflects the continued impact of energy efficiency measures in that sector. However, as Chuck said we continue to see positive developments in our residential customer class where third quarter weather adjusted sales increased 1.7%. This is the second consecutive quarter where we have seen a meaningful uptick in weather-adjusted residential load. Paired with the continued modest increases in our residential customer count, we are cautiously optimistic that these promising metrics will form a trend. In the industrial sector, total deliveries increased 2.5% compared to the third quarter of 2017 for nine straight quarters of improvement over the prior year period. The increase in demand primarily came from our customers in the shale gas and steel industries, but we also saw higher usage of hospitals and universities, which was weather-related. Moving on to our transmission business, third quarter earnings increased $0.02 per share compared to last year. This reflects the higher rate base that are made in ATSI subsidiaries as well as higher revenues at JCP&L. And then our customer segment, our results reflected higher operating expenses and the impact of lower federal tax rate compared to the same period in 2017. Finally, I want to give you a quick update on our liquidity facilities. As a fully regulated company with stable, predictable earnings and cash flow, we have a much improved risk profile that comes with lower liquidity requirements. On October 19, we reduced aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended their maturity dates to December 2022. We also entered into two new term loans totaling $1.75 billion to refinance our revolver borrowings. These credit facility changes reduced interest expense in connection with our FE Tomorrow initiative. We had an excellent quarter with strong financial result. We also achieved very important milestones in our corporate transformation, including an upgrade to investment grade by S&P. We remain focused on execution, and we are committed to positioning FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth to benefit our shareholders, customers and employees. Thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Now let's take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So maybe to just follow up here, what are the ramifications of the cost savings here? Is potential additional latitude from a balance sheet perspective? Can you talk about how you're thinking through the additional FFO to debt latitude? What kind of metrics you want to be targeting? And ultimately given perhaps the litany of opportunities, you already described on the call, where you're trending within your own Capex budget? And if you would see yourself being in a position to increase that Capex budget, whether because of the additional FFO to debt latitude or simply because you wanted to pursue external financing to raise external funds to finance some of the additional CapEx? Charles Jones : All right. So that's like five questions in one there Julien, but I will try to take them all on. So first, FE Tomorrow, the obvious first objective was to deal with the $300 million of shared services cost, which has been supporting the competitive business throughout basically the history of our company. In a way, where none of that become a drag on our ability to execute our regulated plan, we accomplished that. Second was to deal with the $30 million of depreciation associated with common systems that we shared with FES, we accomplished that. On top of that, then $20 million of O&M and interest and $35 million of capital, that isn't going to be substantial in terms of moving our credit metrics. It will be down in the third decimal place. So it's not going to make a big difference. Where we're targeting is 12% to 13%, which keeps us above the Moody's 12% guideline, in the S&P 9% guideline, and we expect to be there for the foreseeable future. And did I get them all? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well, what about just the pursuing external financing? I know a few months ago, you all committed to perhaps staying away from the capital markets and living within your means if you will with respect to hitting your CapEx. But obviously, there's a lot of different opportunities than many continue to materialize here. Is there any chance that you all are looking at or would contemplate raising your CapEx budget to reflect some of these beyond the ranges that you've already articulated? Charles Jones : Okay. So first of all, we've said, we don't contemplate any new equities through 2021, and we'll evaluate it at that point. Between now and then, we'll invest $7.5 billion in infrastructure at FirstEnergy. And at some point, equity might be unnecessary component, but not through 2021. As far as that CapEx planned today, I do not see increasing it. The plan we have generates 6% to 8% per year combined growth for our company. I don't see any reason to take it above that, and I think that's an appropriate number for FirstEnergy at this time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And if I can clarify quickly. Just with respect to the cost savings identified, '19 run rate or how do you think about that flowing into '20 onwards, right? As you think about the various pieces there, annualized and year-over-year if you will, it's more of a timing question. Charles Jones : We'll see it in '19 and beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: The full year '19, to be clear? Charles Jones : Yes. Steven Strah : And Julien, this is Steve Strah. And I would also just say, those savings are in support and blended in within our 6% to 8% growth rate. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. But there's not an annual - annualizing factor such that perhaps that's a more of a '20 figure than a '19 figure or to the extent which that you - okay, great. I will.... Steven Strah : No. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Could you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the local economy and the weather normalized sales and how looks for next year to right now? Charles Jones : Well, the good news is, we are seeing some positive developments when we adjust out the warm weather that we had this summer. 1.7% growth in the residential segment is probably the most positive. We did add 35,000 new residential customers between the third quarter of 2017 and today. So that's contributing to the growth in the past as we were adding customers. We were seeing that kind of eroded by energy efficiency and fuel switching to natural gas and other things. But I think 35,000 new customers and 1.7% growth, and it's the second quarter in a row where we've seen some growth is a good thing. 2.5% growth in the industrial sector, that's now, as I said in my opening remarks, nine quarters where we've seen growth in that sectors. So I think what we're seeing is some of the growth in the natural - national economy is starting to move into the FirstEnergy footprint. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then just any thoughts on the Ohio tax reform order earlier this week, and that seems to get flexibility in addressing, any thoughts on it? Charles Jones : Yes. I'll give you my thoughts. Obviously, tax reform is an issue we've been dealing with across the board. We're done in Pennsylvania. We're done in West Virginia. We're done in New Jersey. We'll be done in Maryland with the resolve of the rate case there. In transmission, the formula rates adjust automatically. We filed a case for the AYE stated rates to make the appropriate adjustments there as FERC requested. That only leaves Ohio left to deal with, and we have frozen rates for several more years in Ohio. But despite that, I expect, we'll be able to sit down and work with the Public Utilities Commission on some type of a settlement that makes sense for them for us and all the interested parties. Steven Fleishman : Great. And then just lastly, I might miss this at the beginning, just at the upcoming Addison conference, the - what if any equipment or disclosures are you providing? Charles Jones : Anything on the plate right now is 2019 guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to step back and talk about changes to the generation mix in Ohio. I guess, you have a number of moving pieces, you have numerous potential shutdowns as well as, I guess, there's a possibility of legislation that it could increase the amount of renewables in Ohio. So I'm thinking about this from an opportunity set in terms of both additional changes to the grid overtime that would be needed. If there is a number of shutdowns, possibility of a FirstEnergy directly investing in renewables, if the target renewables amount goes up. Just generally, it's a longer term, but I'd like to see some of your thinking around what that might require in terms of incremental spending, incremental changes to the grid or involvement of the renewables, anything else on Ohio that you might comment on? Charles Jones : Right now, in Ohio, FirstEnergy is a fully regulated transmission and distribution company. We have no generation, regulated or competitive any longer, and we're focused on what it - the needs of customers are from a T&D perspective. Should there be additional closures in Ohio, there's a process within PJM to review those closures and identify any changes in the transmission networking capability to handle those. Those would be dealt with through the ARTEP process and of course we would make those changes on our transmission system as necessary. At this point in time, under Ohio law, regulatory utilities aren't allowed to invest in generations. So I'm not spending any time worrying about generation in Ohio at this point in time. We're worried about the T&D infrastructure and serving our customers the right way there. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And then just switching over to your cost cutting and making great progress there. I was curious as part of that cost-cutting effort, did you do any kind of a benchmarking, your cost structure relative to neighboring or peer utilities just in terms of how your cost structure looks? And just curious if there's any commentary could provide on pro forma, what your cost structure looks like relative to peers? Charles Jones : Yes. We did, and we used Accenture to help us with this process, Steven. And they brought a number of benchmarks to the table to assist us, including benchmarkings of cost at a high level with our peers. But also things like, layers of management between me and the people doing the work in the corporate office, spans of control for our leadership in the corporate office. That's what drove the entire reduction. As I said in my opening remarks, now that it's all done, our corporate structure cost are in the top quartile within our industry. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And Chuck, just at the utility level, are there any of your units that are noticeably high in terms of the cost, whether it be just because of lack of scale or any other drivers? Just - I appreciated at the current level you've got in your cost down pretty massively. Just curious if sort of any of the subsidiary stand out as having a cost structure that's quite a bit higher than peers? Charles Jones : No. In fact, there - it's just the opposite. Our utility cost structure is generally benchmarked in the top quartile and top decile for both capital and O&M, even at our current CapEx levels. Operator : Our next question comes the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Could I just in terms of the EEI question. If not the EEI, when would be reasonable for us to expect you to think about rolling forward your current outlook, but if I'm not wrong goes through 2021? Charles Jones : I don't think you'll see anything at EEI this year that goes beyond 2021. Jonathan Arnold : And is that something you think, Chuck, you would do sort of with your year-end call or more sort of later in the year next year. This is going to.... Charles Jones : I think it'll be sometime later in 2019. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And if I can, what are you particularly waiting to see before adding another year to the outlook let's say? Charles Jones : Well, there's a number of things we're waiting to see. First of all, we've got a lot of things to focus on now that we're fully regulated. I want to see whether two months make a trend in terms of load growth in our territory or not. I think, that could be a big factor. And beyond that I just think given four years out, what I like to do is give you plans that I know that we have nailed down, and we can execute on. And four years out is a little bit outside of the planning window that I think has proven for us to go to. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then just on transmission, do you - any comments on the recent FERC order, I realize you have rates that have settled. As you look at the sort of potential shift to the new model. Can you just give us some context of how do you think that would set versus where you're earnings are? Charles Jones : Well, here's how I look at it. Our formula rate - rates of return are fairly new right now. The MAIT 1 was just set recently. I think, that bodes well for those rates going forward. I think, longer term, if there's much done to change FERC ROEs, it's going to compress them with the state ROEs, and it's going to work against what FERC is trying to do to stimulate transmission investment because it's going to shift money not just in our case but probably in many other cases, down towards this recent system and away from transmission. So I think that is going to kind of be a control rod in the process. But even if they decide to move forward, here's how I think about it. 0.5% change in the ROE is about a $15 million impact on the FirstEnergy's earnings. That is not significant, and it's something we can make up within the rest of our plan and not something that will take us off track from a 6% to 8% growth rate in any way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Gregory Gordon : I think maybe we should all just email our questions to Julien and just actually ask them all. Sorry, Julien, couldn't help myself, talk to you later. So just to rebase go back and rebase the conversation around earnings. If I recall correctly, your 6% to 8% growth target is based off of a 2017, you know, $2.15 number. Is that - am I remembering correctly? Charles Jones : The 2018 fully diluted number ex DMR. Gregory Gordon : Right. It's a 2018 number? Charles Jones : Yes. Gregory Gordon : Okay, just wanted to make sure I had - that's right, 2018 number. So if I look at that then where within the guidance - that 6% to 8% guidance range or maybe you don't want to comment on this. Would you sort of feel like you were trending now that you've got the CapEx plan sort of solidified, there're cost cutting in the books, FES exiting. And if these types of load growth numbers were to be consistent, would you be confident in your ability to be sort of at the midpoint or towards the upper end of that range at this point? Or are you - is it too early for you to discuss that? Charles Jones : So number one, I'm not going to give 2019 guidance until EEI. So that number, you'll hear in a few weeks. And beyond that, we give a 6% to 8% range. We expect to be within that range, and we don't guide right now to the bottom or the top of that range. So I think you're going to assume that we should be somewhere within that range. And a lot of factors can affect that. As I said earlier, if two months of residential growth becomes a trend that will drive more to the top end of that range. If something happens with FERC ROEs that might move us a little bit down. There's going to be puts and takes throughout that. But I'm confident and we've reaffirmed that, that 6% to 8% growth range over the next three years is something you can count on. Gregory Gordon : Great. And you guys just paid the dividend at the same rate that you paid it since it was cut several years back. Charles Jones : Yes. Gregory Gordon : Can you give us some guidance as to when you think it's appropriate to go to the board to recommend a policy that's more comparable to your peers both in terms of payout ratio and growth? Charles Jones : Yes. So we've been a fully regulated company now for all of about a month since the filing was approved. Gregory Gordon : So what's keeping you? Charles Jones : So I've said all along, if we expect to be treated in the market like our regulated peers at some point in time, we're going to need to have a dividend policy. In the immediate future what's keeping me is, our yield on our dividend is nothing to be ashamed of. It's in the 3.8% to 4% range depending on where the stock price is moving. We began discussions internally with the leadership team to see what we might recommend to the board, and I think just be patient, it will come, and I know we need to do it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful Mehta : So just maybe following up on the earnings side, thinking about the DMR and the extension to the DMR. How do you see that positioned, and if that doesn't come through in terms of an extension, what kind of EPS drop-off do you see with DMR going away? Charles Jones : So all of our earnings projections that we've given you exclude DMR. So there would be no drop-off whatsoever regardless. If we expect to file a case for extension of the DMR early next year, or hopeful that the commission will roll on it by the end of next year, and we'll have the answer about what happens with those last two years at that point in time. But it can only be positive, it cannot be negative. Praful Mehta : Yes, I know, fair enough. And that's I guess where I was going which is, If you do get it, let's put it the other way then what is the upside that you see for the DMR going forward? Charles Jones : Well, if you can calculate what two years of it will be worth. I wouldn't see us taking that money and doing anything with it, that would take us off track long term that we can't continue. That's why we've taken it out of the numbers that we're sharing with you now. Praful Mehta : Got you. Fair enough. And I guess moving on to the credit side and the total debt. I was looking at Slide 31, which had your balance sheet debt and the whole core debt has gone up to about $7 billion. Just wanted to understand, is there a target of like what whole core debt you would like to have as you go through this restructuring process. I noted there was a term loan that was taken as well. So just wanted to get a little more context on the whole core debt and where do you see that going as a percentage of total debt as well. Charles Jones : No higher than the $7 billion that it's at right now. Praful Mehta : Got you. And is there any target in terms of what proportion it'll be of total debt going forward? Or will that only reduce as your rest of the balance sheet, I guess, grows with the growth of the utility side? Steven Strah : Praful, this is Steve. So right now, holding company debt as a percentage of total debt will be around 35% to 40%. Over time, we expect it to go down to about 30%. Praful Mehta : Got you. And just to clarify. On Slide 31, it says it does not include the term loans that you have recently taken. Is that not included with the $7 billion or is it within the $7 billion? Steven Strah : So basically, our holding company debt over time will average to be about $7 billion. So it's going to be a little give-and-take, so it does include the term loans. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : I'll ask for them in orders. First of all, going back to Slide 4 on the FE Tomorrow, the $300 million of costs associated with competitive ops. Who does that actually accrued to? Meaning, does that come back and benefit FE, the new FE, the regulated FE? Does that benefit kind of FES on the way out and prep for emergence? I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's happening there, and whether that's capital O&M or something else? Charles Jones : It doesn't benefit anybody, Michael. It is the actual shared services costs that we've incurred in the past to support the FES and FENOC part of our company that have been traditionally shared with them through our shared services allocations. If we did not deal with it, it would have been a drag on our ability to execute our regulated strategy. So the goal was as FES ultimately says, we don't want these shared services anymore. We needed to make them go away. So it's basically a dollar-for-dollar elimination of the costs that were previously built to FES, so that there's no drag on our ability to move forward. Michael Lapides : Got it. A follow-up on related question. Chuck, you talked a little bit about the yield where your stock trades, and we recognize that maybe on a valuation perspective it trades a little bit differently than some of the other kind of pure-play regulated utilities. Are there strategic thoughts you and the board are having or discussions of whether there are other changes to the corporate structure that maybe possible? Meaning, you've got a great transmission company, if you think the market doesn't value the transmission assets correctly. Are there ways to monetize parts of that or to highlight or accentuate the value of that to the market? How are you guys thinking about the kind of the value inherent within FE and the FE business family? Charles Jones : Well, how I think about it as it's much more valuable than a lot of you think it is. Based on a 6% to 8% growth rate and a dividend on top of that. But having said that, as I said, we're about one month into now being finally a fully regulated company. And me as the CEO, being able to focus on a fully regulated company, probably 2/3 of my focus over the first four years in this job has been on the competitive business, and what we were going to do about it, and how we were going to exit it, and the entire exit process. Now I'm able to focus on the fully regulated side of our company. A company with 6% to 8% growth isn't something that I think we want to - that we need to necessarily do anything with at this point in time. Strategically, to restructure our company, I think it's perfectly structured. We have regulated distribution utilities across five states. We've got now three investment regimes in transmission that are under formula rates, down the road, if it makes sense for the Allegheny transmission system, we move to a formula rate, we'll look at that. But it's all going to be driven about how do we maximize investment for customers and subsequent growth for shareholders out of what we have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Charles Fishman : I just had a quick housekeeping thing. When you initiated the 6% to 8% of the $2.15 base, you talked about shares growing to 545 million in '21. Now you're talking fully diluted 538 million in no equity. Should we just assume we're 538 million flat through 2021 for our modeling? Steven Strah : This is Steve Strah. No, we have a DRIP program that we issue shares under each year. So it's about $75 million to $100 million of equity value. So you can do your calculation based on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Howard Scotia Weil. Andrew Weisel : One of the topics you have been drilled into pretty deeply. So I just have a couple - more details I wanted to dig into. First, on O&Ms, just a quick one on timing, given the favorable weather this summer, were you able to accelerate some O&Ms from 2019 into 2018 that might support the guidance? Charles Jones : No. There was none of that and in fact, because of some reliability issues, we spent a little extra O&M in one operating company, Penelec than what the original budget has. But when you get nine months into a year and you start trying to move money around within a budget, it takes people and contractors to execute what we do in this regulated business. It's a very complex maneuver. And I just want to keep the team focus on executing the plans that we have in front of them. So there was none of that done. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Fair enough. Then two questions on Capex. First of all, how would you describe the conversations with regulators, interveners around the IIP New Jersey and the DPM and potential extension of DMR in Ohio? Charles Jones : So IIP in New Jersey, we're having discussions with both the staff and interveners. We're waiting on commission to issue a procedural schedule. I think, those discussions will go on throughout the first part of next year and will be able to give you a little more guidance on where it stands. I think, in general, the reaction to the IIP has been favorable in New Jersey. And obviously, the commission used it favorably or they never put in place. So I think that one bodes well, but it will get clarity early into next year. On the DMP, as I said, the commission in Ohio spent a lot of time on their PowerForward initiative this year now that, that's done I think they're going to have time to focus on our filing, and we're hopeful that we can get that to a conclusion. So - and on the DMR, we'll make our filing in early next year and will see where that goes. Obviously, we expect to make a case for why the last two years should be continued, but we haven't built any of that into our 6% to 8% growth. Andrew Weisel : Okay.[indiscernible] and then if I heard you correctly [indiscernible] plan. My understanding is that [indiscernible] that anything would be incremental. So if they are approved, should we think about that? Charles Jones : Ask the question again, your voice was garbled and maybe you get closer to your phone. Andrew Weisel : Sorry, apologies. If I heard you correctly you said that the current Capex spend does not really have upside potential [indiscernible]. Charles Jones : I think you should think of the current CapEx plan as the CapEx plan for the next three years, and if we decide to make any changes to it beyond that, we'll let you know then. But I think you can count on it being what it is for the next three years. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Paul Fremont : Just a quick point of clarification I guess on PowerForward. Do they need to make determinations under that proceeding that seems to kick off in early December before they're able to actually act on your request, which looks like it would be sort of covered under the general topic that they're looking at? Charles Jones : No. They're free to act on our request at any time. Paul Fremont : Okay. And so you would expect then that yours will move forward independently from that proceeding? How - when would you expect the scheduling work? Charles Jones : Paul, as I said, I think commission now has time to focus on it. We're having active discussions with the staff on it. I can't give you a date as when I expect an order, but I'm optimistic that we can get something done on it in the not-too-distant future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Jones for any final comments. Charles Jones : Okay. Well, I'd like to thank you all for your support of FirstEnergy. We look forward to seeing you at the EEI in a few weeks. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thanks, Christine. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website, along with the presentation which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Irene, and good morning, everyone. 2018 was perhaps the most pivotal year in FirstEnergy's history. Through a series of careful coordinated actions, we met our commitment to fully transform FirstEnergy into a premier high-performance pure-play regulated utility. I will spend just a few moments recapping the year, then move to our opportunities for 2019 and beyond. We began 2018 by announcing a $2.5 billion equity investment from several prominent investors. Among other things, this new investment enabled us to reduce our holding company debt by $1.45 billion, eliminate the need to issue additional issue additional equity outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans through 2021, and contributed a total of $1.25 billion to our pension plan in 2018. That investment also helped us accelerate our regulated growth in infrastructure improvement plans. And for the first time ever, introduced a long-term growth rate projection for our regulated operating earnings. In April, we reached an agreement in principle to address our obligations in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions and all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company. Our final definitive agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in September. Reaching a fair settlement with the debtors, Unsecured Creditor Committee and key creditor groups within months of the bankruptcy filing helped us deliver on our commitment to quickly and thoughtfully exit competitive generation, allowing us to turn our attention to FirstEnergy's future as a fully regulated utility. The settlement and our improved risk profile as a utility was stable, predictable earnings and cash flow cleared the way for an across-the-board upgraded S&P, including an upgraded issue or credit rating at FE Corp. and a positive credit outlook with Fitch. In turn, we had lower liquidity requirements and took several steps in October to reduce our financing costs. We reduced the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended the maturity dates to December of 2022. At the same time, we refinanced our revolver borrowings through two new term loans totaling $1.75 billion. To effectively and efficiently support the growth of our regulated transmission businesses, we completed our FirstEnergy Tomorrow initiative to realign our shared service organization and cost structure. Through a voluntary enhanced retirement package and the elimination of open positions, we reduced headcount in our corporate support functions by 40% and expenses by 43% without any involuntary employee layoffs, which is an accomplishment I'm very proud of. At the same time, we created a flatter, leaner management team by reducing layers and increasing spans of control. We identified and eliminated $300 million in costs associated with our previous support of competitive operations. And we expect to realize an incremental $85 million in savings due to additional reductions in capital, interest and O&M expenses. As a capstone to our transmission, our board approved a new dividend policy along with an initial 6% dividend increase in November that reflects confidence in our regulated long-term sustainable growth plans. With a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of operating earnings, the new policy supports increased shareholder returns and continued investments in our strategic initiatives. Our stock ended the year with a total shareholder return of 27.7%, making FirstEnergy the top performer in the EEI Index. I know many of you have been long-term investors in FirstEnergy, and we thank you for both your confidence and patience. With all of this going on, I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees stayed focused and executed on our growth initiatives. Last night, we reported full year 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.59 per share. Operating earnings exceeded our initial 2018 guidance and were at the top end of the range we provided in October. This makes four consecutive years of consistently meeting or exceeding our guidance to the financial community. Our 2018 results benefited from weather, solid execution of our growth strategy in the transmission and distribution businesses, and modest load growth in all three of our distribution customer classes. We remain encouraged with the overall trends in our distribution business. Industrial sales have increased steadily for 2.5 years, while most of that growth is driven by the shale gas industry, we're also seeing sustained improvement in the steel sector. Our weather-adjusted sales to residential and commercial customers were modestly positive across the full year, and we're pleased to see continued gains in the number of new customers in these segments. In our transmission business, we are entering our sixth year of Energizing the Future program. We continue to efficiently execute our long-term customer-focused strategy to modernize the transmission grid across our service area. Our transmission rate base at 30% of our total regulated assets ranks among the largest in the nation, and our transmission spend as a percentage of market capitalization is at the top of our industry. We are excited about the future, and I believe we are poised for a strong year ahead. Let's shift gears to recap some of our ongoing initiatives and expectations, starting with our regulatory activities. First, our Ohio utilities have a supplemental settlement pending with the Public Utilities Commission in a matter of tax reform and grid modernization. The original settlement filed last November was signed by the PUCO staff, representatives of industrial and commercial customers, environmental advocates, hospitals, competitive generation suppliers and other parties. The supplemental settlement added the support of residential customer and low-income advocates. This settlement addresses how all of the tax savings associated with federal tax reform would be returned to customers and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities also made a filing with the PUCO to request approval for a two-year extension to the Distribution Modernization Rider. Rider DMR was first authorized by the PUCO in 2016 to provide additional revenues to ensure our Ohio utilities have access to lower-cost capital that promotes a faster and more economical path to modernizing the distribution system for the benefit of our Ohio customers. While we believe we have a strong case to continue this rider, I will remind you that it is not factored into our earnings growth projections. In Maryland, hearings took place in January, and we expect a final order by late March in our first Potomac Edison base rate case in nearly 25 years. As we have discussed, our request of $17.6 million will address recovery of investments to provide safe and reliable service to our Maryland customers, and it is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform. And in New Jersey, the procedural schedule for our four-year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan was suspended due to settlement discussions. JCP&L Reliability Plus will enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. Throughout this year, we expect our newly formed Emerging Technologies group to continue identifying opportunity for future investments that will allow us to better serve our customers by analyzing and implementing advanced technologies and working with state and federal policies designed to improve grid performance and energy security. We are affirming our 2019 full year guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. Now let's turn to Steve for a review of our results for the fourth quarter and other financial developments. Steve Strah : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. First, a reminder, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter and the year are posted on our website in our consolidated report to the financial community. Also, consistent with our practice over the past year, we present operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis. This allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and eliminates the impact of conversion timing. About 87% of the preferred shares had been converted as of January 31. We expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be included by the end of July in accordance with the terms of the equity issuance. With that said, let's get started at a look at the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings were $0.25 per share. This includes a pension mark-to-market adjustment and other special items. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share, in line with the top end of our guidance. In our distribution business; our results benefited from higher deliveries, lower financing costs, and stronger regulated commodity margin in West Virginia. These factors offset higher depreciation and O&M and which was primarily related to additional vegetation management work in Pennsylvania. Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Residential sales increased one half of 1% while commercial deliveries were up 1.7%. Weather had a modest impact on sales with heating degree days about 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. On a weather adjusted basis, commercial deliveries increased 1.8% and residential deliveries were essentially flat. In our industrial sector, the trend of steady growth now is stretched into 10 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter deliveries increased 1.4% compared to the same period of 2017. This was led by gains in the shale gas, steel, and electric equipment manufacturing industries. In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings at our formula rate companies were $0.02 favorable due to higher rate base at MAIT and ATSI. This was offset by higher O&M in our stated rate transmission companies. And in our corporate segment, we had slightly lower operating earnings offset by higher income taxes and the non-deductible portion of interest compared to the same period in 2017. Now I'd like to take a moment on this month's $500 million pension contribution. First, a quick history. Beginning in 2011, we adopted the mark-to-mark method for our pension and other post-employment benefit accounting. Each year, typically in the fourth quarter, we remeasure our pension assets and liabilities to recognize changes in discount rates, actual return on planned assets, and other differences to the actuarial assumptions. The loss or gain is recognized in our GAAP results. This is a preferred method of accounting under GAAP because it recognizes the actuarial gain or loss in the year it occurs instead of amortizing it over a longer period. We exclude this adjustment from our non-GAAP operating earnings to provide greater transparency to our ongoing operational performance. In 2018 our mark-to-market adjustment was a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share. Lower than expected returns were partially offset by a higher discount rate, which was on the high side of the estimate we provided in our third quarter materials. So we ended 2018 with approximately $3.9 billion of liquidity, of which $367 million was cash. We expected this favorable cash position to remain through 2020 so we decided to put the cash to work for us now by making the $500 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan on February 1st of this year. This contribution improves our pension plan's funded status to 82% and it eliminates any projected minimum funding requirements through 2021. As Chuck noted earlier, we're making great progress with the rating agencies. We're now investment grade across the board by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch; and we expect further ratings improvements over time as we execute the regulated growth plan that we've outlined. As many of you know, S&P tracks an FFO to total debt metric with a minimum threshold of 9%; Moody's tracks a CFO working capital to total debt metric which has a current minimum threshold of 12%; and Fitch tracks an FFO adjusted leverage metric with a maximum threshold multiple of 6.5 times. We expect to be compliant with all three rating agencies and their respective thresholds through our 2021 planning period. Our actions during 2018 redefined FirstEnergy. We're excited about our future as a premier fully regulated utility. Today more than ever, we're focused on three things; implementing our strategies, delivering on our commitments, and building a brighter future for our shareholders, customers, and employees. And now before we turn it over for your questions, Chuck would like to share a few additional comments. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Steve. Today marks the final earnings call for two longtime members of our executive team who many of you know well, Leila Vespoli and Jim Pearson. Leila and Jim are both retiring in the next couple of months following long and distinguished careers with our Company. They both played key roles in our mergers, various acquisitions, and our transformation into a fully regulated utility; and both have been key trusted advisors to me during my tenure as CEO. I want to thank \u2013 take this opportunity to recognize their strong and thoughtful leadership and to wish them a happy and healthy retirement. Now I'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Hey, good morning, everyone. And again congrats to Leila and Jim here, it's been a pleasure. Chuck Jones : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up quickly, starting first with the commentary on New Jersey, the Reliability Plus program, just the commentary on a suspended timeline here in settlement discussions. How do you think this could advance just procedurally here through the course of the year and against the CapEx that you've already outlined? And then separately, I noticed you kind of mentioned this in conjunction with the newly formed Emerging Technologies Group. How do you think about the total potential size of spend here especially as you go through the settlement process? Chuck Jones : Okay. So first in New Jersey, what I mentioned is that the procedural schedule has been suspended to allow the settlement discussions to continue. Obviously we don't have a settlement to announce or I would have announced it today so, but we're hopeful that we can get to a settlement. But your second question I think is an important one and that is we are planning to spend just shy of $3 billion of CapEx per year for the next several years in our footprint. So when I think about the New Jersey spend, obviously we filed that plan because that's where we would like to spend $400 million over the next four years. But in the event we don't get to a settlement and then we get back on to the procedural schedule and that doesn't work out either. We have plenty of opportunity around FirstEnergy in four other states and transmission to make these investments in order to support the 6% to 8% growth that we are committing to. As far as the Emerging Technologies piece, I think that's one of the most exciting things about where we're at as a company that we actually now have the time and the resources to start thinking about what do we want FirstEnergy to be in the future. We've committed to kind of what we're going to do over the next three years as far as capital deployment, but we're really looking state by state, utility by utility, and transmission at what are those new emerging technologies that makes sense for us to invest in on behalf of our customers, what are the regulatory and legislative impediments to being able to do that, and then we've got three years to start working on how do we deal with those impediments. And as I said, it's just I think an exciting time because I've just finished or just started my 41st year, I guess I would say, with this Company. The first 40 years we've been working in one form or another to always put some of the past behind us and today for the first time, we're really in a position to start looking to the future. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Excellent. And then quick second question here. I suppose the conversations are kicking off in Ohio again, about any potential legislation. Is there anything that you all would be looking towards on the utility side, specifically here if anything at all? Chuck Jones : Not in any specific form, Julien. Obviously, if our new leaders of the states \u2013 we have a new governor, a new speaker of the house, we\u2019re going to have a new Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. If they determine that they think the time is the right to really put energy policy for the state back on the table in some fashion, legislatively, then we would expect to engage and provide our input. But it\u2019s too early in the process for me to talk about what that might mean. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you all very much. Congrats, again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon : Hey, guys. Thanks, good morning. Just a quick question on the \u2013 you guys said that \u2013 in your prepared remarks that you expect to be compliant with all three rating agencies\u2019 minimum thresholds over the course of the financing period \u2013 over the course of the forecast period. Given your 2019, I guess, when I think about the Moody\u2019s metric, in particular, right, the FFO forecast is lower now because of the pension contribution, but that should basically be trading math since it reduces your assumed pension deficit. This, all things equal, will be sort of neutral to the calculation. Is that the right way to think about it? Steve Strah : So yes, we expect to be in the right place with all three rating agencies throughout the planning period. 2019 has some unique attributes because of the remaining liabilities for the exit of competitive generation that are \u2013 that will be gone in 2019, and I think, in our conversations with Moody\u2019s, they\u2019re looking beyond that period at more where we\u2019re going to be in the 2020, 2021 time frame. So we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to stay above the threshold for all three rating agencies, and hopeful that we can even get to a position where we see further positive movement from them. Greg Gordon : Okay. That, I guess, without being \u2013 I was trying to be less blunt, but I just didn\u2019t see you guys at above 12% in 2019 based on the cash flow profile you laid out in this guidance, but your explanation for that is that the CFO is negatively impacted by the remaining exit costs from FES and it should look better in 2020 and 2021? Steve Strah : That\u2019s right. There\u2019s a little dip below 12% this year, but it writes itself next year. Greg Gordon : Okay. You\u2019re always very direct. And I appreciate that. Thank you. That was my question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Arnold : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the pension. You mentioned expecting that kind of cash position to continue to be strong into 2020. Is \u2013 and you don\u2019t expect to have to make any minimum contributions. But is there a scenario where we might see further voluntary contributions along the way here and just kind of how you\u2019re thinking about that as you\u2019ve been moving the funding up? Chuck Jones : I\u2019m not thinking about any further voluntary contributions right now. This one, the timing was such that we did have cash available to do it. And as you all know, our pension plan was hurt by the performance of the fund in 2018 as was everyone else\u2019s. And taking this step early helped offset some of those losses that we incurred last year. But right now, we don\u2019t have any plans to do anything. The next mandatory contribution is in 2022. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And can you share what would the size of that be, Chuck? Just kind of as you look at it today? I think you \u2013 before you had a $330 million for 2021 was the number you gave us at EEI. Is the 2022 number in the same ballpark or something smaller? Steve Strah : Jonathan, this is Steve Strah. It is in the same ballpark. Right now, we have that estimated at just about $380 million, once again that\u2019s in 2022 and we\u2019ll \u2013 that will be subject to how the market performs over the next several year period, and we\u2019re comfortable. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one other thing on the \u2013 we don\u2019t have time to review the filing on the DMR and as much detail as we\u2019d like. But Chuck, could you just give us the sort of high level on how you\u2019re justifying the request to extend and whether it\u2019s similar or evolved a little from the original request? Chuck Jones : So first, obviously we\u2019re very thankful that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio did this for us several years ago. It helps insurers, as I said in my prepared remarks, low-cost capital to begin the process of modernizing the grid in Ohio. Our filing pretty much is along those same lines. And I think we have a strong case to argue for two years of additional DMR funding. But I also have said repeatedly, we don\u2019t have that in any of our growth plans, the 6% to 8% growth rates are not depending on it. And even if we get it for two more years both, those of you who evaluate our stock and the rating agencies, you\u2019re going to factor it out because it\u2019s only for two more years. But having said that, the cash and the availability of that cash to make meaningful investments in the grid in Ohio is important to us going forward. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi guys. Chuck Jones : Hi Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. So I just wanted just touch on pension, again just to clarify. Is the proportion of equity versus debt products that are invested from a pension plan changing as a result of the performance in 2018? Or is that consistently a high proportion of equity? Just so I understand going forward how should we think about the volatility of that fund? Steve Strah : This is Steve Strah, again. We are not going to change our approach in terms of the composition of the investment portfolio. Roughly 70% of that portfolio is return-seeking. And I don\u2019t see any meaningful change coming. Praful Mehta : Understood. And the change in discount rate that offset a lot of that earnings impact, is that also one-time? Or how do you see that discount rate changing? Steve Strah : We ended up moving to the full yield curve last year. So that turned out to be beneficial for us, and I think, we\u2019ll just see how the market and interest rates move over the course of the year, Once again, we see no change in our approach. Praful Mehta : Got you. On the credit side, it was very helpful to have the full context of all rating agencies. I wanted to understand is there any threshold from a holding company debt perspective that you\u2019re also looking to achieve within the targets from a rating agency perspective? Steve Staub : Praful, this is Steve. So from a holding company debt perspective, we\u2019re targeting right around 35% to 37% holding company debt as a percentage of total debt and Moody\u2019s specifically is aware of that and they have no issues with it. Praful Mehta : Understood. Well, that\u2019s super helpful. And finally, just from a strategic perspective, clearly, the transition has gone really well, your metrics are in line apart from the small pension stuff, everything seems to be working well. Is there at some point apart from pure execution, thought around strategic intent both on the buy or sell side in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that? Or is it purely just execution mode at this point? Chuck Jones : So obviously, I\u2019ve been getting this question a lot lately and those are the types of things that, number one, even if there was something we were thinking about, we wouldn\u2019t talk about it. But, number two, growth through M&A in this industry is becoming increasingly difficult, increasingly costly to get the regulatory approvals necessary. I think many of our regulatory commissions are \u2013 it seems to be concluding that bigger companies aren\u2019t necessarily better. But having said that, any opportunity that presents itself, we would take a hard look at. And if it makes sense both short term and long term for shareholders. I think we\u2019ve demonstrated we\u2019re willing to tackle tough decisions to make this company more valuable for our shareholders so we would do that. And as you know how that part of what we do works, Gary Benz, who is my Chief Strategy Officer, is listening to proposals from investment bankers all the time about things that they think can make our company stronger. We evaluate every single one of them and if everyone presents itself that really does make our company stronger, we\u2019re going to make it happen. Praful Mehta : Got you. I hear investment bankers do that so I appreciate it. Thank you for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Congrats on a good year. Just looking at Slide 23 and it has the distribution ROEs versus authorized. And a lot of these are pretty well below what the target, and obviously, Ohio is a different animal given how rate making\u2019s done there. But just curious how you\u2019re looking at some of the other subsidiaries, whether West Penn, one or two others, maybe even New Jersey; where it looks like these things kind of imply pretty sizable under-earning. How you\u2019re thinking about rectifying that or whether it implies there\u2019s a base rate case coming in one of those jurisdictions? Chuck Jones : Well, it\u2019s interesting the question about under-earning because I get them many, many times about concerns about us over-earning. And here\u2019s what I would say. Take Pennsylvania, in particular, as of January this year the DISC has been turned back on for all four of our distribution operating companies and as you\u2019re familiar with how the DISC works, we\u2019re making investments under the DISC. Those investments will contribute about $0.02 a share to our 2019 growth. So one, that\u2019s the method we\u2019re using right now. At some point in time, if we bump up against the maximum amount of investment we can make under the DISC, then we will be required to have another base rate case around of base rate cases in Pennsylvania in order to roll that in and then be able to use the DISC going forward. But we\u2019re a ways away from that point. I would not anticipate any rate case filings in Pennsylvania this year for sure, even though our stayout is expiring this year. In Ohio, we\u2019re in a rate freeze through 2024. In Maryland, we\u2019re just wrapping up a rate case with new rates to go in effect on March 23. It\u2019s not been that long since we had a rate case in New Jersey. So, the investments that we\u2019re making this year and really for the next several years, it\u2019s just shy of $3 billion. Over 50% of that is being made in transmission formula rates and realtime riders in our distribution companies. And so the 6% to 8% growth that we\u2019re talking about does not depend on any rate cases in order for us to achieve that growth. It\u2019s merely executing the plan, investing in these formula-driven mechanisms, and then the growth will occur. Michael Lapides : Got it. I just want to follow up on that, though, and I\u2019m thinking New Jersey specifically, I mean the 2.1% trailing 12-month ROE that you\u2019re showing on this, anything abnormal or highly unusual in that number only because that\u2019s just a really sizable spread relative to authorized. And the IIP will help on future investment, but it may not help if you\u2019ve got significant O&M lag that\u2019s already in place. Chuck Jones : I\u2019m going to let Eileen answer that one for you, Michael. Eileen Mikkelsen : Thanks. In looking at the loaded ROE for JCP&L on that Slide 23, I would note that, that was a number that preceded our last base rate cases the note says. So, it\u2019s the last publicly available published ROE number from prior to implementing rates from our last rate case. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated. Chuck Jones : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman : Yes. DMR question was answered. So let me ask you this, Chuck. You made the statement either at third quarter call or at EEI that you didn\u2019t think the market was appreciating the transmission system of FirstEnergy. I suspect that you had influence on that graphic on Slide 5 showing it\u2019s 30% and anyone can see that that number is going to go up based on your CapEx plan. What else do you do to get \u2013 what\u2019s going through your head as far as how you get people to appreciate the benefit of the FERC-regulated transmission? Chuck Jones : Well, I think number one, we do have to start talking about it more and we are a company that has a large transmission footprint, 24,000 miles of transmission lines, largest in PJM, one of the largest in the country, it is 30% of our regulated assets, it\u2019s growing at 11% per year over the next three years in that 6% to 8% growth rate. So I think it\u2019s worthy of really calling it out to make sure investors see it. I think there are a couple of other things holding our stock back from rerating. One is the continued overhang of FES and even though we have reached a settlement with all the creditors and that settlement have been approved by the court, there\u2019s still some confusion in the market as to our ongoing relationship with them that I don\u2019t think will go away until they actually emerge and change their name at some point hopefully later this year. So, I think that\u2019s holding us back. But I think \u2013 I can\u2019t undersell the value of what the transmission system means to FirstEnergy and its shareholders. We\u2019ve got forward-looking formula rates for all of it, but the former Allegheny system, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re making all these investments in ATSI and MAIT right now as I said. I mean, when you think about the investments we\u2019re making over the next three years, more than 50% of them are in formulaic mechanisms that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s just execute the work plan, and we\u2019ll execute the growth that we\u2019ve committed to. Charles Fishman : So in New Jersey, where it\u2019s state-regulated transmission, mostly, and I realize you\u2019re in the middle of the settlement negotiations, but I suspect that they have to give you some kind of formulaic treatment of your investments in New Jersey or else you\u2019ll focus more on your FERC-regulated. Is that correct? Chuck Jones : I think, we\u2019ll be successful next year in moving JCP&L to a formulaic mechanism, still regulated by the state likely, but that\u2019s the game plan. But the answer is yes. I mean as we think about where we\u2019re going to invest shareholder money, we want to put your money in good investments. Good investments are formulaic mechanisms at transmission, realtime riders and distribution that don\u2019t have regulatory lag, that lead to the improvements that we\u2019re making to also serve customers. And you\u2019ve heard me say this before, good investments are the ones customers are willing to pay for and shareholders are willing to invest in. So all of what we\u2019re doing is also driving improved service for customers. And just take the ATSI part of our Energizing the Future, we reduced transmission outages by almost 40% on the ATSI part of our system. And a single transmission outage can affect \u2013 it affects tens of thousands of customers up to maybe 60,000 to 80,000 customers at times. So those improvements are great for customers too. Charles Fishman : Okay. Thanks a lot, Chuck. That\u2019s all I had. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Most of my questions have been answered. I did want to just directly address that question, Chuck, you mentioned before in terms of just the accounting calculation of ROE versus the real regulatory calculation of earned ROEs. Would you mind just at a high level talking through in Ohio as an example just some of the adjustments that need to be made to get to the proper sort of regulatory calculation of earned ROE? Chuck Jones : I think it\u2019s way too complicated to get into on an earnings call, Stephen. So, I\u2019d be happy to talk to you offline or have Irene go through it with you. But as I said, in Ohio, our rates are frozen through 2024 and you can imagine all of the different moving parts with DMR, with a DCR rider that\u2019s been in place for now, I think we\u2019re in year seven of that and it goes on through to 2024. The ultimate grid modernization rider. There are unique treatments for some of the lost revenue from energy efficiency improvements we\u2019ve made. It\u2019s just very complicated and we can\u2019t go through the numbers on the call, but those are examples of things that affect how it looks from a GAAP perspective, from how it turns out from a regulatory accounting perspective. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And then just lastly, you mentioned the Emerging Technologies Group. It sounds like an exciting new area. Is it possible to give an example or two of the kinds of technologies that generically might offer some benefits to customers and system operations? Chuck Jones : I would say \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example. Not saying it\u2019s going to end up the way we would want it to end up, but one particular example would be electric vehicle charging stations. We\u2019ve had two of our governors, New Jersey and Pennsylvania express their desire to have significantly more electric vehicle penetration in their state. One of the impediments to accomplishing those goals is going to be a robust charging network. Utilities, like ours, and not just ours, are skilled at building infrastructure. They are skilled at planning infrastructure. They are skilled at \u2013 an example of that case of building it out in a way that it\u2019s robust, but not duplicative, doing it for a 9.5% to 10% return on equity, which is a very cheap way to finance it. And I think it\u2019s something that if we really want more EV penetration, our states ought to look at having there utilities help them accomplish. Right now, none of our states want us to do that, but that\u2019s an area where I think we\u2019re going to have ongoing conversation with them about the value that we think we can bring to help them with their environmental strategies for their states. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. Mr. Strah, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. Steve Strah : Well, thank you all for your persistence in staying with us over the long haul. We\u2019re really excited about where we\u2019re at as a company, really excited about the next three years, and then as we get more into this Emerging Technologies area, excited to tell you about it once we know more. So, thank you for your time this morning. Look forward to talking to you again soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Please go ahead. Irene Prezelj Thanks, Brenda. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website, along with the presentation which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Before I turn the call over to Chuck, I\u2019ll note that we updated our investor materials with the goal of making it easier for you to find the information you need on our website. Our former consolidated report has been merged into our quarterly earnings package with additional materials provided in our fact book. As always, we welcome your feedback on these changes. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. We're off to a very good start in 2019. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share along with operating earnings of $0.67 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. Steve will discuss later our results reflect the continued success of our regulated growth strategies. Let's begin with an update on our progress so far this year. In our transmission business, we're on pace to implement a plan to $1.2 billion investment in our Energizing the Future program in 2019. With most of that work in our ATSI and MAIT service territories in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Just a reminder, energizing the future is a multi-year program to improve the reliability, resiliency and security of FirstEnergy\u2019s portion of the bulk electric system that is shared by our entire nation. It\u2019s working. Just one example is that we have reduced transmission outages due to equipment failures on our ATSI system during the first four years of the program by 37%. And while we are still finalizing year 5 [ph] results, it looks like that will increase to eliminating more than half of the equipment related outages in ATSI. We expect similar results in May as we move forward. We currently have about 1000 projects underway in stages ranging from engineering and project development to project management and construction. Many of these are multi-year endeavors and we expect to bring 600 to 700 projects in service in 2019, which is consistent with our pace during the last several years of this customer focused initiative. To support our Energizing the Future initiative, this month we opened our center for advanced energy technology or Kate in Akron. This 88,000 square foot facility is one of the most comprehensive grid technology testing and training centers of its kind in the country. We designed it to be a centralized hands-on environment where our engineers and technicians can develop and evaluate new technologies and grid solutions and simulate a variety of real world conditions. It also includes classroom space where we can train our workforce to safely use new equipment and processes as we upgrade, maintain and ensure the security of the grid. In addition to supporting our grid modernization program, Kate also creates opportunities for us to advance best practices across the industry. We hope to collaborate with peer utilities research institutes, research institutes and key stakeholders such as device manufacturers, who could potentially utilize our state of the art facility. Turning to our distribution business, as we mentioned last quarter, our Ohio Utilities filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission in early February for a two-year extension to the distribution modernization rider. Again, while we believe, we have a strong case to continue this rider I will remind you that it is not factored into our current earnings growth projections. Also in Ohio, our supplemental settlement regarding tax reform and grid modernization is pending with the PUCO. This proposed settlement addresses how customers will benefit from savings associated with federal tax reform and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million over three years. In New Jersey, we were very pleased to reach a settlement yesterday with the staff of the Board of Public Utilities, the division of Rate Council and the New Jersey large energy user\u2019s coalition for our infrastructure investment program. Our JCP&L Reliability Plus program builds on the service enhancements we have made in our New Jersey footprint in recent years with an additional $97 million investment. Through this program, we plan to implement more than 1400 targeted projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency of overhead power lines, replace existing equipment with smart technology devices and expand the vegetation management program to reduce tree related outages. On final approval from the BPU, the work will take place between June 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Once the projects are complete, customers will experience fewer sustained outages under normal conditions as well as a reduction in outage duration. While there was a difference between our original IIP request and the settlement amount, we have plenty of opportunities to make those capital investments in other parts of our system, both in distribution and transmission. We will also contemplate filing a subsequent IIP in New Jersey, to continue our investments there beyond 2020. In Maryland, the Public Service Commission issued a final order in our Potomac Edison rate case on March 22nd. The order fully resolved tax reform in Maryland, calls for a final bill credit to customers to return prior period tax savings and allows Potomac Edison to increase based distribution rates by $6.2 million net of tax reform, to invest in safety and reliability enhancements. In addition, the Public Service Commission approved a four year Electric Distribution and infrastructure surcharge rider. That program will be used to recover incremental costs related to three reliability programs, which include installing more distribution, automation equipment, accelerating an underground cable replacement program, and utilizing new substation rate closers that can minimize the number of customers impacted by service interruptions. Potomac Edison is required to file another distribution rate case at the end of the surcharge period. In January, the Public Service Commission also approved Potomac Edison\u2019s five year $12 million pilot program to install electrical vehicle charging stations in Maryland and offer rebates for charger installations. As part of the program, Potomac Edison plans to install 59 public charging stations at locations across our Maryland service territory, including nine fast chargers, residential customers will be eligible for rebates for the installation of EV charging stations at their home and rebates will also -- will be available for charging stations installed at multi-family properties. We're proud to support Maryland's efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, which is an important step for a cleaner, healthier, environment. We see projects like this as a natural fit for First Energy as we fulfill our mission to become a forward looking utility committed to making our customers lives brighter, the environment better, and our communities stronger. Our environmental and social on government strategy is built on the pillars of our mission statement. In 2019, we are continuing our efforts to offer greater transparency and engagement with our ESG goals. Late this year, we will produce a new corporate responsibility report to examine our efforts on issues as wide ranging as diversity inclusion, our environmental footprint, corporate governance and community support. This will complement our first climate report, which we published earlier this month. The Climate Report looks at how our strategies as a fully regulated utility are aligned with the emerging technology trends that support a lower carbon future and examines the business risks associated with a carbon constrained economy. It also reviews our significant progress towards the carbon dioxide reduction goal we announced in 2015. We pledged to reduce CO2 emissions from our generating fleet by at least 90% below 2005 levels by the year 2045. At the end of 2018, we had already achieved a reduction of 62% with about three quarters of that reduction related to plant retirements. We expect to reach a CO2 reduction of 80% later this year well on our way to achieving our goal. I want to express our experience with plant decommissioning activities. Over the past 12 years, we safely and responsibly retired and remediated seven coal plants, and successfully anticipated the economic and environmental concerns for each site. This is just one of the ways in which we have demonstrated our commitment to corporate responsibility. It is a core value that we stand by at all times and that includes during the FES bankruptcy. That is why a key component of our settlement agreement was our substantial support for FES to both emerge from bankruptcy and meet any legacy and future obligations. This includes all environmental responsibilities that could occur when the plants are eventually retired. Following the judge's decision on the FES bankruptcy earlier this month, FES committed to engage with the Department of Justice and other concerned parties. In light of the commitment by FES, our previous assessment of the obligations and the surety and funding that are already in place. We see no increase risk to removing the broad third party releases from the comprehensive settlement. While these releases would have served to bring finality to First Energy's involvement with these legacy assets, removing their releases does not in our assessment and experience increase liabilities or obligations to our company. We are pleased that FES has submitted a revised disclosure statement and believe they will continue to work constructively with all parties to ensure both timely approval of their plan and their bankruptcy exit. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our 6 million customers with a commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility and implemented our regulated growth strategy. We are affirming our 2019 full year operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share including this year's DMR. In addition, we are introducing a second quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share and affirming our long term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 68% from 2018 through 2021. Thank you. Now turn the call over to Steve for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments. Steve Strah Good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders. First, reconciliations and others detailed information about the quarter are available on our Website in the strategic and financial highlights documents. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance. With that, let's take a look at our results. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.59 per share. Operating earnings were $0.67 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this is above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher weather adjusted residential load, and lower interest expense related to debt refinancing. I'll spend more time on that topic in just a few minutes. These factors were offset by higher depreciation expense related to our rate base. Total distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 with a slight increase on a weather adjusted basis. Heating degree days were close to normal for the quarter and comparable to the first quarter of 2018. Residential sales were a bright spot for us this quarter. Sales increased about 1% on a natural basis when adjusted for weather, the increase was almost 3% with growth in both customer counts and average usage. The upturn in weather adjusted residential sales over the past 12 months is an encouraging sign. In the commercial customer class, sales increased about 1.5% on national basis and about 1% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load was flat, marking the end to a long 10 quarter run of growth in that segment. The results reflect lower demand from steel and automotive manufacturers, which offset growth, continued growth in the shale and chemical industries. Turning to our transmission business, earnings increased as a result of higher rate base, which reflects our continued investment in the Energizing the Future initiative. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses at our stated rate transmission companies. And finally, in our corporate segment, first quarter results reflected higher net financing costs in the absence of commodity margin from the Pleasants Power Station. As a reminder, we began to exclude Pleasants from our operating earnings in mid-2018 due to the court approved settlement that transfers economic interests of the plan to FES. These factors were partially offset by a lower, effective tax rate. Touching on underlying strengths of our distribution and transmission companies, we have recently seen positive, credit ratings actions for several of our subsidiaries. Near the end of March, Moody's issued one notch upgrades to ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L. And last week, Fitch issued one notch upgrades to JCP&L, Manpower, Potomac Edison and Allegheny Energy generated company. We believe these positive actions are a testament to our overall improved risk profile and we expect to see continued positive momentum. Before I close, I'll take a moment to review our financing activities this year. At our utilities, we refinanced $300 million of maturing debt at both JCP&L and MAIT during the quarter. We issued new senior notes totaling $900 million to re page or return borrowings and fund capital expenditures at these utilities. We also issued $500 million of new debt at First Energy Transmission and $100 million at ATSI, primarily to repay short term borrowings and fund continued investments in our Energizing the Future program. Lastly, from a liquidity perspective, as of Friday April 19, we had approximately $3.7 billion of liquidity of which $200 million was cash. Thank you for your time. We had a very solid quarter, and we're off to a great start this year. Now let's take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Q - Greg Gordon Hey good morning guys. Good quarter. Thank you. A - Chuck Jones Hi Greg. Q - Greg Gordon Can you talk a little bit about the -- the settlement in New Jersey, I think, you guys had asked for approximately $400 million of Electric Infrastructure investment over four years. I think you settled on $100 million over two years. How did we get -- ask to the to the deal, and do you think that's adequate to provide the safe and reliable power to those customers and how does that proceed after that? A - Chuck Jones So first of all from our perspective, Greg we're very happy with this settlement. It's now the second time, we've been able to reach a settlement in New Jersey with the main parties that influence our ability to do our business over there. Very happy with the settlement. To put it in perspective, it's $97 million over an 18-month period, which begins in June of this year and ends at the end of 2020. So just to give you a little perspective, where we talk in Ohio about $516 million over three years, let's double the number of customers. So if you have that, it's $258 million and it's double the number of years, three, versus one and a half. So if you have it again, it's $129 million. So we're spending $97 million in New Jersey versus $129 million in Ohio on an apples-to-apples basis. It's a good start, and we're very happy with it. And I believe if we execute to perfection, and we deliver the results that we intend to deliver in New Jersey, we won't have any problem negotiating an addition to this that goes beyond 2020. Q - Greg Gordon Great. Thanks for the perspective. Second question. When I -- when we look at the -- when we look at the new agreement that you've made to move forward with the get the disclosure statement that FES bankruptcy approved and get this thing done. What's the critical path now for the FES bankruptcy to be fully and completely resolved voted on, and for them to exit? Is it -- that we're waiting for the nuclear license transfers and -- or is it some other issue. And what's your best guess as to sort of the window of timing on when this is wrapped up? A - Chuck Jones Well with the caveat that I am not the CEO of FES and FEG, I would suggest that I think the nuclear license transfer is probably on the critical path. Now that we've kind of moved forward beyond the court ruling I believe, with regard to these nonconsensual third party releases. Let me just comment on that a little bit more. I would say that, that caught us by surprise with the focus of the court being solely on the releases and not on the actual settlement, because we believed in the actual settlement that we have provided substantial value to make sure that FES can emerge, operate these assets and deal with any retirement obligations when those come down the road. So we felt like the nonconsensual releases weren't a big deal, because of the substantial settlement that was on the table. But since the focus is on those, we decided to remove those and move forward. So now the next step in the process is for the court to move or to approve the disclosure statements and allow the process to continue moving forward. We're hopeful that will happen on May 20th, and then and then they will continue to make their case for emergence and we expect that to happen sometime later this summer. And then the license transfers would be on the critical path if it -- if it all flows that way. Q - Greg Gordon Okay. So later this summer would be great, August or September. Appreciate the color. Thank you. A - Chuck Jones I think it's later in the year than that Greg. It\u2019s probably November, October November with the transfer. Q - Greg Gordon Got you. October, November. Thank you for being clear. Have a great day. A - Chuck Jones Okay. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumolin Smith with Bank of America. Q - Julien Dumolin Smith Hey good morning. A - Chuck Jones Hi, Julien Q - Julien Dumolin Smith Hey. Thank you for taking the question. So maybe just a start where Greg just left off. Might be a tad detailed, but just if you give us a little bit of sense, obviously you've posted a surety bond already specifically against some of the assets here and one of the larger collage assets. Can you talk about where that number came from just the firm it up in terms of. I know you said in your prepared remarks, this doesn't change the metrics as far as you see it. How did you come up with that surety bond number, and you how do you think about that relative to the obligation of that? Because obviously that came from somewhere. So I just want to try to be a little bit more confident out there. A - Chuck Jones Well. First of all those -- the surety bonds have been in place for quite a while now, all the way, way back to the beginning of our negotiations with FES and they arrived at given we have already begun the process for example, with Little Blue Run at the Mansfield plant of closing it in steps part by part every year. So we've got a good track record of what the cost to do that are, and the surety bond is was put in place to ensure that that their surety for those costs, should we at some point not decide to do it, but we're not going to do that. And I want to -- I want to say very clearly, what I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to stand behind any environmental commitment that we have if we sell a power plant. We're still in that chain of ownership at some point if the new owners would default. But the other thing I want to say very clearly is we're not afraid of that, because we've shut down, retired, remediated, tore down and turned over sites in some cases for seven coal fired power plants already. The cost, the benefit that you get out of the scrap, steel, iron, copper, aluminum, the property value For aluminum the property value et cetera, this is not any big deal for FirstEnergy. And so, we\u2019re to move forward fine. But as I said before I want to repeat, we provided substantial benefits to FES that they're going to have the ability to take care of this on their own. Q - Julien Dumolin Smith Excellent. Thanks for the clarity there. If I can briefly here on credit overall, obviously that\u2019s little bit tied to this process. How you think about that continued added latitude new metrics as it stands today given the timeline you just talked to Greg about as well if you don\u2019t mind? A - Chuck Jones Well, I think if you\u2019ve been watching we\u2019ve seen nothing but positive action out of the credit rating agencies, positive action in particular down at some of our utility levels. But I don't expect that that\u2019s going to change going forward. I think we were in constant communication with the rating agencies. They know we\u2019re at in this process. When we had the little speed bump with the bankruptcy court, we communicated with them and I don't see anything that\u2019s going to affect it on the downside. As we emerge and as we get this process completely behind us, I think we can make a case that we\u2019re a much less risky company and that \u2013 we got to be able to move forward all in a very positive direction. Q - Julien Dumolin Smith Do you think it\u2019s more than a percent or so versus the debt latitude as it stands today? A - Steve Staub Yes. Julien, and this is Steve. At the end of day the rating agencies are viewing this year as a year of the transition for us, okay? So upon emergence for FES will be responsible for putting forward the $225 million payment and issuing the tax note of $628 million for 2022. So, I think they understand it\u2019s transitional. Once again, we believe that the beyond that we\u2019ll be at our 12% FFO to debt ratio going forward and as the expectation we have going forward. We don\u2019t see those base line expectations changing. As Chuck said, we\u2019re working very closely with all three agencies to ensure, they\u2019re fully aware of where we\u2019re at. All the positive movements have been great so far. We want them to do their jobs and further consider. And I know they are cognizant that our risk profile is lowering at every point in this processes as FES gets through their bankruptcy. Q - Julien Dumolin Smith Excellent. I\u2019ll leave there. Thank you very much. A - Steve Staub Thanks, Julien. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Q - Jonathan Arnold Good morning. And I think couple of my questions were just asked, but I\u2019d like just on the FES and the release change. Is there any accounting implication of that? Any AROs that you\u2019d have to recognize that you wouldn't have had to recognize with the releases, just wanted to just tie up any loose end there? A - Chuck Jones I\u2019m sitting here watching my chief accountant said \u2013 say, no. Q - Jonathan Arnold It\u2019s good to hear, Chuck. Thank you. That was it. Operator Our next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Q - Praful Mehta Thanks so much. Hi, guys. A - Chuck Jones Good morning. Q - Praful Mehta So, unfortunately I will also ask a little bit on this FES and the environmental side. If you could \u2013 could you dimension for us and given all the experience you\u2019ve had and clearly the risk seems low here and you clearly help FES kind of stand on their own in terms of the remediation, but just to understand what is the risk, like if there is a look back period on the environmental side, how -- what are the factors that could kind of increase the liability from an FES perspective that could slow-up to FE, if you had to kind of look at worst-case scenarios, what are the scenarios that we should be thinking about in that case? A - Chuck Jones Well, I think it\u2019s pretty simple actually, Praful. FES would have to go bankrupt the second time without having dealt with these environmental legacy issues that would then if they fall to FirstEnergy we will deal with them. But as I said earlier, we\u2019ve got already experienced with what that means from an economic perspective and from an environmental perspective to take these plants down, return the land to a greenfield status and move forward and get it certified that way by the State EPAs that have jurisdiction over these sites. So there's just not that much risk. The value of the scrap and the value of the property offset and there's a cottage industry that has developed as a result of the number of power plants closing around this country to take these plans off their hands. They\u2019re actually offer to pay you in some cases for the opportunity to deal with this legacy issue on your behalf, so it's just not something we\u2019re concerned about. Q - Praful Mehta Got you. Again, very helpful color. But just to clarify, how good can that environmental cost be, like \u2013 is there coal ash? If they were like what can that number be before you get to the remediation and then obviously this scrap benefits. But is there a ballpark number that we can think about as a potential liability if FES does go bankrupt the second time? A - Chuck Jones With regard to any coal ash liabilities, the surety bonds that are in place already protect us on that front. So there aren\u2019t any beyond that they we\u2019re worried about. And as I said, the economics are such that there\u2019s nothing there that I\u2019m worried about in terms of ongoing financial obligations to our company that of what you get out of the scrap and the property. Q - Praful Mehta Got you. Again, super helpful color. Maybe a final question just on the DMR. In terms of timing of a decision is there any clarity on when a decision will come on the potential extension of the DMR? A - Chuck Jones No timing. We\u2019ve ask for them to get moving and potentially you have hearings as early as August. Obviously, the existing DMR expires at the end of this year. So we would push hard for any answer sometime this year. So, we know what the impacts going to be next year. Q - Praful Mehta Understood. Again thank you so much. A - Chuck Jones Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Q - Unidentified Analyst Hey, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s actually James on behalf of Shar. A - Chuck Jones Okay. Hi, James, how are you? Q - Unidentified Analyst Good. I just had a quick follow-on question to Greg\u2019s question regarding New Jersey. I know you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that you\u2019ve had conversations regarding EVM's restructure? And then we also just saw one of your neighbors propose a very large EE program. And I was wondering if we did see anything on either of these fronts in the near term? And then, would that be an addition to a 2021 IIP or is the bandwidth kind of limited there? A - Chuck Jones I don\u2019t think there's anything ongoing there right now, James. We were focused on getting a settlement on the IIP through 2020. And what we plan to spend that $97 million on does not include anything to do with EV or it's what I said in my remarks. It\u2019s improving the real-time reliability to customers. And beyond that what we plan, what we would look at beyond 2020 we haven't even started to focus on that yet. Q - Unidentified Analyst Okay. So, no conversations really on the EV at this point? A - Chuck Jones Not really. Q - Unidentified Analyst Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Q - Chris Turnure Good morning. I had another follow up on the New Jersey settlement. Could you give us a sense as to your regulatory strategy going forward there? You mentioned filing another IIP in a year or two. Why would you maybe choose that route versus going in for a full general rate case, given I think you are under earning in the state? A - Chuck Jones Let me just summarize our regulatory strategy overall, because I think it's the same everywhere. When we believe it's time for another base rate case, we will have a base rate case and that's whether it's New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, our rates are frozen for at least five more years. So \u2013 but we would have base rate case whenever that makes more sense than using the IIP or using the DISC in Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to look at that and evaluate it at all times. I don't see any meaningful base rate cases in 2019. And then, we\u2019ll evaluate and we\u2019ll let you know what we see is the plan for 2020 when we get out to 2020. Q - Chris Turnure Okay. But for now the kind of earned ROE trajectory there, plus your earnings from this settlement and the investment that comes from that are sufficient in your view? A - Chuck Jones Yes. Q - Chris Turnure Okay. And then my second question is on holdco financing strategy. I think on the last call you said the holding company would be around 35% to 37% of consolidated debt this year. Can you just give us some flavor as to that amount? How much of it is kind of long-term debt, short-term debt, term loans? And how much of that separately might be variable rates? A - Chuck Jones Yes. I'll let Steve Staub to answer that in detail. But I would just say, it's -- that's the level we're going to be at for the foreseeable future. And I continue to believe that as we get more financial flexibility as a company we're better off investing and serving our customers better and indirectly creating growth for our shareholders as opposed to retiring this debt. It's better and makes more economic sense I think for everyone involved. But I'll let Steve take you through the details of what constitutes that corporate debt. A - Steve Staub Sure. So, in terms of the composition of our holding company debt at FE Corp., we have 1.750 billion [ph] in term loans. That's our most cost effective debt on an after tax basis that's right around 2.5%. Then we have 5.35 billion in bonds that on an after tax basis is anywhere from 3% to 3.5%. And then, we have the $628 million tax note yet to be issued once FES emerges we will issue that note and that will be outstanding until the end of 2022. In terms of financing activity, I suspect that at some point in time over the next 12 months we will most likely go out into the bond markets and refinance the term loan position and potentially do some liability management on some of the bonds mature in 2022 and 2023. So you could see a sizable bond deal at some point in time with FE Corp over the next let's say 12 months. And as Chuck said, our holding company debt is going to be around the mid 30s, 35% to 37% for the foreseeable future and that's where we're going to be. Q - Chris Turnure Okay. That's helpful. And fixed versus variable rate is kind of embedded within that answer with the term loans being the variable component? A - Steve Staub That is correct. The term loans are the only variable debt that we have. Q - Chris Turnure Okay. Thank you, guys for the color. Operator Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Q - Michael Lapides Hey, guys. Thanks for the taking my question. And congrats on a good start to the year. I have two, both a little bit on the regulatory side, obviously at the distribution business. First of all West Virginia, how are you thinking, Chuck, about a multi-year goal in terms of potential rate base growth reemerging or reigniting in West Virginia in the coming years? Meaning, how do you think about what the opportunity set for investment in that state is? That's my first question. My second question is about Pennsylvania. If I look at the data on your slide 31 in the fact book you guys put out last night. Some of the subsidiaries earnings, I don't know, trailing 12 months 2018, south of 8% or 7.5% earned ROEs. Just curious why -- I think three of them were below that. Why that wouldn't stimulate potential rate case filings in the coming months there? A - Chuck Jones All right. Well, first of all, thank you for asking regulated questions. It's nice to be able to answer those instead of FES questions. But with West Virginia, here's what I say, we don't have any long term strategy for West Virginia. We had in place a tree trimming strategy in particular because we had a number of storms dating back to the derecho back in 2013. I think that was -- that that show that we had some exposure there. But beyond that West Virginia is kind of a state that we're in a business as usual mode. We\u2019re we're spending money every year. We're seeing some growth in West Virginia as a result of being a fully regulated state. Industrial growth in the shale and chemical sector and as well as in the north eastern part of West Virginia and our Potomac Edison West Virginia territory, we're seeing some growth. That's offsetting our costs. When we get to the point there where we think we need to have a rate case, we'll have a rate case. But right now, we just don't see any need to and I don't have any long term strategy because I think we're performing okay and there's nothing that needs immediate attention in West Virginia. With regard to Pennsylvania, we've made a concerted effort to improve our disclosures and I think that means you all are going to be talking to Irene quite a bit. But I don't think we want to get into details about rates of return and so forth on this call. So I'm just going to encourage you to talk with her off line about it. But I will point out that in Pennsylvania as of the first of this year the DISC is turned on in all four of our operating companies in Pennsylvania. We cannot turn that DISC on unless we're underneath the threshold for allowed rate of return as the commission looks at it. So I think we're in good shape. We're using the DISC at all four companies and I think we ought to take it off line to talk about the details, because as we get more and more transparent it's going to create a lot of questions that we just don't have time for on an earnings call. Q - Michael Lapides Got it. Thank you, Chuck. A - Chuck Jones Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Q - Andrew Weisel Good morning everyone. Chuck, [Indiscernible] I was going to congratulate you guys and the IRR team in particular for the new slide deck. I like the look of it. Two questions for you guys though both regulated, so don't worry about that. First one is, I know you haven't updated the CapEx outlook in a little while, but given the DPM and JCP&L Reliability Plus settlements, should we expect results to trend towards the higher end of the ranges? Or is it more a function of improved visibility into recovery with less or no lag? A - Chuck Jones Well, I think in what we\u2019ve said as far as our going forward 6% to 8% growth plan, we've said that the CapEx program in general is going to be in the $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion range combined T&D throughout that planning period and I expect it continues to keep it in that range. That range contemplated. The IIP in New Jersey had contemplated where we were at with the grid mod in Ohio. And we provided a range there to allow for some movement in all of what we do. You can't plan down to the dollar -- $2.9 billion of capital spend. But I think you can count on it being in that range throughout the planning period and probably likely beyond the planning period. Q - Andrew Weisel Should I take that as a no comment on high end versus middle versus low end? A - Chuck Jones There's so much that moves around that it's going to be what it will be. We have capital costs related to storms that we expect to be able to cover within that range. If we have a heavy storm here, I'll move us to the high end. And if we have a light storm here it will -- there's just so much that moves around that I'm not trying to dodge your question. I just don't know the answer to your question and that's why we\u2019ll provide a range. Q - Andrew Weisel Okay. Understood and fair enough. Next one I have is a little bit different direction than some of these other questions. Three of your largest states are at least contemplating some sort of ZEC programs for nukes. I know you don't have any plans for rate cases in the near term as you talked about. But do you worry about affordability impacts on rates on these programs? And how do you balance the tradeoff of reliability versus cost especially now that you're out of the generation business? A - Chuck Jones I don't worry about it at all because I think these states that are stepping up to protect their nuclear plants are ensuring long term rate stability for their residence and their customers in those states, and it's providing a hedge against the most high beta fuel that we've ever had in this industry which is natural gas. It's providing a surety that they have ample supplies of electricity during the most strained times of year in frigid climates where natural gas cannot meet all of its obligations. So, I think it's providing and just take for example, the bill that's pending here in Ohio. It's $2.50 per month on a residential customer bill. To provide that security we all buy insurance for our homes, our cars and a lot of other things. It's a very cost effective insurance policy that these states are taking out and it provides long term economic benefit and clean air benefits too. So, I think these states are smart and I'm on record and I'll continue to say as long as I have. I have this role. These states are making up for failed market policies that are not working correctly. When you form a market on nothing but a lease cost, marginal cost, it's not going to ever take care of the fixed costs of these important assets. So I think the states are all doing the right things. Q - Andrew Weisel That's very clear. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question is from the line of Agnie Storozynski with Macquarie Group. Q - Agnie Storozynski Thank you. I will go back to FES. So just taking a step back, I understand whole of the explanation about the limited \u2013 as any liabilities, but you did try to have this release included in the FES Settlement. So there must have been a reason why you wanted to have it there. So, if you'd never thought that there is a risk why did you have it in the settlement? A - Chuck Jones Well, Angie, I said in my prepared remarks, it was in there to try to create some finality which is I think important in everybody's minds as FES exits that is much finality as we could create we created. And that's why it was in there. Never expecting it to be the focus that it became during the bankruptcy process and the focus it became with the Justice Department. So, we believed that it could be in there because the substantial settlement that we've worked out with FES provides for taking care of these obligations over the long term and provides for their ability to exit, operate and then eventually deal with any plant closure costs that come their way. So we just didn't see it as a big deal one way or another, but it was in there to try to provide finality. And -- but once it became a speed bump we have no issue with removing it. Q - Agnie Storozynski Okay. And then on Ohio DMR, so, I mean is there -- are you engaged in negotiations? Is there any range of possibilities that you would consider. I mean, what is the pitch at this point in the sense, are you're trying to say that your investment level in Ohio will increase commensurate, so that\u2019s basically humping 33 million in extended DMR. I mean, what can you give us here? What\u2019s the bid and ask spread is currently? A - Chuck Jones Well, as I've said, we have nothing built into our forecast going forward for DMR. We've asked for the current level to be extended for two years which is what the original filing gave us the ability to do the bid ask and I guess its anywhere from zero to the current levels. Our approach is that it has driven what the commission was trying to do, which is stimulated investment in our Ohio utilities in grid modernization efforts that will hopefully then be built upon with approval of our grid modernization program once the commission gets back to a full business schedule. Unfortunately, we had a change in chairs and it's taking a while for them to get the train back on the tracks and moving forward there. But I expect we'll get approval of the grid mod program and build upon it. So the basic premise for why we are saying it should be extended is to continue to stimulate the things that the commission was trying to do in the first place. Q - Agnie Storozynski Okay. Thank you. A - Chuck Jones Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Q - Charles Fishman Good morning. Transmission; memory serves me that MAIT and ATSI, a few years back you agreed to a lower ROE in exchange for going forward rate making framework because of the hundreds of small projects you had and then obviously in hindsight appears to be the right decision based on the earnings growth there. But with all that -- with the discussion going on in FERC, the ROE review. Because you're already at a lower ROE relative to some other systems around the country, is that something that really we shouldn't even be concerned about that just not going to impact you? A - Chuck Jones Well, first, we agreed to make that change with ATSI, ATSI was at a higher rate of return on a lagging formula rate which as you said meant that a project they got done in January of 2019, we wouldn't start earning on until June of 2020 under that old. So now when that project goes in a forward looking formula rate, return to cash and earnings to the business much quicker. So the lower rate of return made sense for ATSI. When we founded MAIT, we founded MAIT from the beginning on a forward looking formula rate with a 10.38% return and MAIT it\u2019s not that old. So I think it was set very recently. I don't think there\u2019s anything that we\u2019re worried about with regard to earned rate of returns in our transmission businesses. So I don't think there should be anything that you are worried about. And my read of the [Indiscernible] or what it's worth at the FERC is while they\u2019re looking at rates of return they\u2019re looking at in ways to continue to incent investment in this grid across this entire country, not ways to disincent. So I just don't think it's something that we should be concerned about. Q - Charles Fishman I realize your CapEx goes out to just 2021, are you even thinking about an energizing the Future Phase 3? A - Chuck Jones Well, I think I\u2019ve said before, we have $20 billion of transmission projects that our team has already identified that they believe need to be done. And so given that need, I would expect it it's going to continue to be something we focus on for the foreseeable future. So, while I\u2019m not telling you what our CapEx plan is. I think my expectations it\u2019s going to be in that range for quite some time. Q - Charles Fishman Okay. Like your new slide deck. Thank you. That\u2019s it. A - Chuck Jones Okay. Thank you. End of Q&A Chuck Jones All right. Well, I don\u2019t see any more questions in the queue here. So, I want to thank you all for your time today. And thank you for your continued support of FirstEnergy, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy. Thank you. Please go ahead. Irene Prezelj : Thanks, Brenda. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thanks Irene. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Last night we reported solid second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share, along with operating earnings of $0.61 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance range, which we provided on our last call. While the mild spring weather across our service territory contributed to lower distribution sales this quarter, our results benefited from continued transmission rate base growth related to our Energizing the Future program, as well as lower expenses. We are executing on our plans to focus on customer service oriented growth, as we strengthen our distribution and transmission systems and prepare them for the grid of the future. As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see, as you may start to find our calls a little boring, but seriously, I'm very excited about where we are at, at FirstEnergy, but more importantly, where we are going. Let's start with a review of some of the recent developments in our business over the last few months, then Steve will walk you through the results and as always, we will have ample time for your questions. In our transmission business, we remain on pace to implement $1.2 billion in Energizing the Future investments this year with 600 to 700 projects on track to come into service during 2019. Last week we participated in a transmission summit hosted by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Our team brief the commission and staff on the key areas of investment addressed by our Energizing the Future program, the need for this work and the benefits to customers as well as our process for project selection. When we began our Energizing the Future initiative, a large portion of the work, supported projects required by regulators, which included changes taking place in the electric generation sector and supporting local load growth. Today our transmission system is expected to withstand cyber-attacks and extreme weather events, help predict when maintenance is needed and limit the impact of outages when they occur. Reflecting the shift, our investments are focused on utilizing technology to modernize the grid, enhance security and create greater operational flexibility, while also upgrading aging infrastructure. As we discussed last quarter, these investments are designed to significantly reduce the impact of transmission outages on our electric customers. For example, where work has been completed in our ATSI service areas since 2014, we've recognized nearly 50% reduction in the duration of customer interruptions caused by transmission outages and a 52% reduction in the number of customers affected by such outages. I would like to remind you that one transmission outage can impact tens of thousands of customers, saw 50% reduction in outage events is providing tremendous reliability benefits. To manage the hundreds of transmission projects in various stages of planning, development and construction each year, we are implementing our new performance management process called achieving performance excellence or ApEx. The goal is to refine our transmission project management processes into a more structured, consistent and efficient method of delivering projects as designed on time and on budget. Turning to our distribution business. On May 23rd, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our modified long-term infrastructure investment plans or LTIIPs, the plans increase the spending in each of our four Pennsylvania operating companies in 2019 by total of about $85 million. This includes accelerating capital that was planned for 2020 as well as additional capital to support enhancing reliability in the state. We are currently recovering these investments through the DISC Rider at all four utilities. Next month, we plan to file new LTIIPs that will outline our Pennsylvania operating companies incremental reliability spending plan for the 2020 through 2024 period. Before we move from Pennsylvania, I will mention that we have signed a non-binding term sheet to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2. This would transfer the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the responsibility for decommissioning to a subsidiary of Energy Solutions, LLC., an industry leader in the nuclear decommissioning business. As background TMI-2 is currently license to do GPU Nuclear and owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L. We acquired in 2001 as part of the GPU merger, since it was not an operating plan, it was never part of FES or FENOC. While we are still to beginning of the process, which requires numerous regulatory approvals, this agreement would transfer future nuclear obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. Turning to New Jersey. The BPU approved our JCP&L Reliability Plus plan in early May and we've begun to implement this infrastructure investment plan with projects designed to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system. One of the first projects is installation of 1700 new TripSaver automated reclosing devices on local neighborhood powerlines. These devices help limit the frequency and duration of service interruptions by automatically detecting issues, isolating outages and pinpointing the location of problems to help speed restoration. Now let's turn to Ohio, where there has been quite a bit of activity over the last several weeks. Last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for our grid modernization program. With investments of $516 million over three years. The stipulation was approved unanimously by all five commissioners and the commissioners complemented the parties on reaching a global settlement that resolved many issues with a broad base of support. This order also fully resolves the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Ohio, with our customers receiving 100% of the tax savings. We expect related refunds to begin this quarter. In addition, we will begin the work to further modernize our Ohio electric distribution system. The program is designed to reduce the number and duration of outages and help our customers make inform decisions about their energy usage with advanced metering and communications. On July 15th, we filed our 2018 Significantly Excessive Earnings Test or SEET results with PUCO for each of our three Ohio utilities. Each utilities individual 2018 return on equity was well below our calculated SEET threshold and the consolidated ROE for our Ohio companies was 8.8% also well below calculated threshold. The Ohio operating budget approved last week included an amendment allows us to combine our Ohio results under a single SEET review. This change will not increase our customers rates, it preserves an important consumer protection and maintains the ability of the PUCO and other interested stakeholders to assess our annual earnings. At the same time, it allows us to implement our rate plan in a manner that best serves customers across our entire Ohio footprint. In other developments, House Bill 6 was approved by the Ohio legislature and signed by Governor DeWine yesterday. As you know, the key issue of House Bill 6 is a support it provides to nuclear assets in the state, while we no longer own this generation, we believe this legislation is good for our customers, because it will contribute to the state's economic success and the security and resiliency of the regional electric grid, while mitigating the potential impact of uncertain electric markets on our customers' electric bills now and in the future. House Bill 6 also includes provisions that allow electric utilities to implement a decoupling mechanism, which further supports energy efficiency initiatives that benefit Ohio customers, while providing revenue certainty to utilities. It was set residential and commercial base distribution related revenues at the levels collected in 2018, breaking the link between revenue and the amount of electricity consumed. We are reviewing the potential impacts to our customers and the companies and could seek approval for this mechanism later in the year. Finally, I know many of you are interested in the status of our Distribution Modernization Rider, as a bit of background this rider was approved by the PUCO in 2016. It initially allowed the collection of $204 million in revenues each year for three years and that was adjusted to $168 million in 2018 after tax reform. 2019 is the last year of the initial rider, although we filed earlier this year to extend the DMR for two more years. In June, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a 4-3 decision calling for removal of rider DMR from our Ohio Company's current rates. But the court recognized that the funds already recovered under the rider are not subject to refund. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the court. We firmly believe the DMR was benefiting our customers by jumpstarting our investments and grid modernization and we believe we have a solid legal argument to support our position. However, along with the motion for reconsideration, we proactively filed with the PUCO to make the DMR charges billed during the reconsideration period, which began July 1st subject to refund, if the court ultimately orders the rider DMR must be removed from our rate plan. Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per share. If we do not ultimately recover the approximately $0.12 per share contribution from the DMR for the second half of the year, we would expect results in the lower half of this range. We are also introducing a third quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.68 to $0.80 per share including the DMR of $0.06 per share. Finally, we are affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. You'll recall that the DMR has never been included in our growth projections. Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the second quarter and the first half of the year. Steve Strah : Good morning, everyone. It's good to speak with you today. As always, I'll begin with a couple of housekeeping items. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis, this provides the best comparative view of our performance. As of July 22nd, there are currently 181,520 preferred shares outstanding, with conversions expected to be completed by January of 2020 Now let's look at our results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share, as Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results were primarily impacted by very mild spring weather, which contrasted with a very hot spring in 2018. This drove lower load across all three of our customer classes. Results also reflect the absence of last year's benefit from a court ruling on cost incurred for renewable energy credits in Ohio. These factors were slightly offset by the impact of lower expenses and income taxes. Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the second quarter of 2018 both in actual and weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 20% below normal for the second quarter and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2018, while cooling degree days were about 4% below normal and 28% below the same period in 2018. Residential sales decreased 9.7% on an actual basis compared to the second quarter of 2018% and 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis. Overall, our weather-adjusted residential sales have grown modestly over the last 12-month period. Second quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 5.6% on an actual basis and about 3.2%, when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load decreased 1.7% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel and automotive manufacturers. If you look back at the second quarter of 2018, steel sector usage was about the highest we've seen over the last four-year period and our automotive sector still included the now closed GM Lordstown plant. These changes contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison. Moving to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative. And at our corporate segment, second quarter results reflect lower operating expenses, which offset higher net financing costs. Before I open the call to your questions, I'll review a few items within recent ratings activity. We are pleased that Moody's upgraded the credit ratings yesterday of several of our utilities. Ohio Edison and Penn Power were both upgraded from Baa1 to A3. CEI was upgraded from Baa3 to Baa2 and Toledo Edison was upgraded 2 notches from Baa3 to be Baa1. The ratings outlook is positive for Ohio Edison and Penn Power and stable for CEI and Toledo Edison. We believe these upgrades in addition of those earlier this year by Moody's for ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L demonstrate the underlying strength and positive momentum of our regulated platform. In addition, as you may know, S&P recently revised its group rating methodology, which is used to determine issuer credit ratings for entities that are part of corporate groups. As a result, we expect to see positive actions for several of our operating companies that have a stronger credit ratings profile than the consolidated group. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and through the first half of this year, we remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our plans. Now let's take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumolin-Smith: So want to go back over this and I acknowledge at the outset that this is still early days in implementing this, but can you elaborate a little bit on the mechanics of this decoupling element. I know there is a 90-day element to file for it, but how exactly, would it be implemented with respect to full year 2019. And then secondly, in addition of the mechanics of filing for it and applying it to the 2019 year, how should we think about establishing 2018 rates that might be the trickier piece here. But how do we understand 2018 versus 2019 and I appreciate the nuance that you have these other tracker mechanism in place that make it a little bit apples and oranges at least from our side to see it comparably. So if you don't mind, because I get at the end of the day this is a decoupling mechanism, but there is a few nuances here? Chuck Jones : Well, let me try to tackle it at a high level first and I don't think we're going to be prepared to speak to the exact nuances and how it's going to affect either 2018 and 2019 till we get a chance to fully analyze it. But the bill was our clean energy bill at its heart the decoupling is included in the bill to support Ohio\u2019s clean energy goals. It allows all of the utilities to continue to work with customers to drive further energy efficiencies without a concern for the impact on the revenues with the companies. In Ohio, we have a shared mechanism for lost distribution revenue that this now eliminates the need for us to worry about that. And it's ultimately going to - it will help reduce customer bills because that energy efficiency mandates on our bills, we're going to grow significantly over the next several years. AEP, Duke and DPL already had some type of decoupling mechanisms in place. And I\u2019ll point out this applies to the base rates only and as you already said Julien, it's a 90-day period before it goes into effect and then 30 days. So we're looking at November 20th would be the earliest date that we could file for being included under this new decoupling mechanism. And the commission would ultimately has 60 days to make a decision. So that pushes it till January 19th. For me, as I look at it, I think if you combine the decoupling opportunity with the seat provisions that were combined - that were included in the budget bill with our ESP that's already in place through 2024. It puts us in a position for our Ohio companies where the base distribution revenues can be very predictable and very strong. And the growth in our Ohio utilities is going to come from continued investments in the DCR rider and the 516 million that was just approved for the grid modernization rider. So I think it's going to ultimately provide a very clear and transparent story for our three Ohio companies, but I just can't give you the specifics on the details of how it affects 2018 and 2019 just yet. We've got to get into it. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Maybe let me make this simpler, just to help frame this. Because I suppose, if you look at year-over-year comps, like you just did. I mean how much are you down year-over-year on weather as you think about it and if you were to think about it specifically for our Ohio if that might be an easier way to just frame it, just year-to-date. Can you tell me if that's appropriate to? Chuck Jones : Yes, Steve is going to answer the weather issue. Steve Strah : Yes, maybe I can tackle the weather at a high level issue Julien as we try to compare two very different quarters when you look at 2019 versus 2018. 2018 was very hot weather, it makes the quarter-over-quarter comparison challenging weather adjustment for us is art part science. And this is just one quarter, so it's kind of dangerous to compare them year-over-year. When you look at our trailing 12-month average, I think I'm more comfortable, looking at that and really on an overall basis total loads are about 0.2% to the positive. So we view that as the broader indicator. And I think Ohio tracks along very well with that comparison. Hopefully that helps. Julien Dumolin-Smith: And just again to clarify the last question there. Since, you would file potentially on November 20th earliest that could still apply to 2019, even if you don't get a decision until June 2019. Just to clarify that last piece of the process? Steve Strah : Yes. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Excellent, well, thank you all very much. Chuck Jones : And on this topic, I just want to take a moment to say how great it is in the State of Ohio to have leadership in Columbus, who actually looks at issues and is willing to lead. I want to complement our Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Senate President, Speaker of the House, numerous members of the legislature and Senate, and the Chairman of the Commission because they all work together on a very complex bill here. With a goal I think of providing stable and transparent rates for customers going forward and keeping their Ohio utilities strong at the same time. I think they came up with an approach that was very strong in terms of looking out for this industry and our customers in the State of Ohio. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Charles Fishman : Chuck I either had a bad assumption or - a memory here. I always thought the plan on TMI was to wait until unit one retires and then do both of them together. I guess my first question is, am I wrong about that. And then related to that is, I realize you're just at a term sheet, but what we've seen with other nuclear owners that have retired plants. And I'm assuming this is what's going to happen with energy solutions they take over the trust fund in exchange for all the responsibilities of the decommissioning and decontamination. And then what you would do once you have a signed contract is or the two of you acting together since they can accelerate this decommissioning. You would go ahead and derisk the trust fund and certainly there is a good time to be doing that. So there'll be plenty of money in that is. Do I have this correct right? Chuck Jones : Well, let me kind of take it from the beginning. First, I don't believe there was ever any plan to decommission both units together. One unit is owned by Exelon, one unit is owned by FirstEnergy through GPU nuclear and the utilities as I said. And I think both Exelon and us are going to make our own decisions about how to move forward with our assets. Our decision was up until now we've been relying on Exelon for some support with TMI-2. And there is ongoing monitoring and things you have to do that now that they have made the decision to close TMI-1 that caused us to start looking more seriously at what we needed to do with TMI-2. And I think that basically what I'm trying to say is the term sheet outlines an approach whereby all of the liability for decommissioning along with the decommissioning fund the license, the property, the assets, will all be transferred to Energy Solutions and it will get FirstEnergy out of the nuclear business entirely. Charles Fishman : And there's plenty of money in the trust fund. Chuck Jones : Well, I think that's the thesis from Energy Solutions perspective is, that they\u2019re good at this. There is plenty of money in the trust fund and they believe they can execute and decommission it for less than what's in the trust fund with whatever is left over being their margin so to speak on the decommissioning. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Paul Fremont : I guess first question would be, I noticed on the pension that the slide is unchanged from the fourth quarter but interest rates, I think are substantially lower than they were in the fourth quarter. Can you provide any type of an update on what the unfunded pension liability would be at the end of this year versus sort of the 1.6 billion that you were indicating, I think in that slide? Chuck Jones : I'll turn it over to Steve, but I'll point out that it's July and while the returns on our pension have been doing really well. Last year December was a horrible month and caught everybody by surprise. So we can't really predict in July, what we think is going to happen, but we can give you. And Steve will give you a kind of a year-to-date outlook on where we're at. Paul Fremont : Great. Steve Strah : Paul, it's Steve Starh. So Chuck -- it's only July, we've really won't have a clear picture until we get to the end of the year. Specifically on what the asset performances as well as the impact of the full yield, yield curve. But right now based on what we know our funded status is right around 82%. Paul Fremont : So that actually that's consistent with where, what the slide would show it to be right? Steve Strah : Yes. So we ended 2018 right around 77% and keep in mind, we made a $500 million contribution earlier this year, so that benefited us and so the impacts that we have related to our return on assets are basically offset by the change in the full yield curve to date. So that washes and so the $500 million contribution really improved our funded status from 77% to 82%. Chuck Jones : And I would just round it off by saying, we don't see a need for an additional contribution through our planning period through 2021. Paul Fremont : And then any update on when you might provide an indication of growth beyond 2021. Steve Strah : Not before EEI this year at their earliest. Paul Fremont : And then sort of last question on the CapEx guidance that you're providing particularly for Ohio and New Jersey, does that reflect the settlement because you're still providing sort of a fairly wide range is in both of those jurisdictions. And is there -- and if it doesn't, you sort of, provide an update as to where you would see yourself in the ranges for both for both Ohio and New Jersey? Steve Strah : It does reflect a settlements and we provide the ranges. Just to give us some flexibility as the years unfold to move some money around from state to state transmission to distribution et cetera for things that come up that are unforeseen and that's the only reason the ranges are there. I think you can expect us to be total capital and that $2.8 billion to $3 billion range each of the next several years. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Two questions. First of all on the distribution business, how are you thinking about the outlook for O&M and O&M growth over the next year or so? Chuck Jones : I would say we're look -- thinking about it being flat. Michael Lapides : So keeping O&M growth relatively flat versus what a 2018 ongoing O&M level at 2019 level or I'm just trying to think about what the baseline is? Chuck Jones : I would say the baselines been where the baseline spend but we just, we just went through our FE Tomorrow program which reduced some of our obviously corporate O&M and exceeded our original targets by $50 million. So that's all been baked in to our current numbers going forward as we make these investments in transmission and distribution. What we're trying to do is make investments that have offsetting reductions in O&M that can allow us to kind of keep our O&M flat as things like wages and the cost of material and supplies go up incrementally each year. Michael Lapides : One other and a little bit of an unrelated question, you've tracked pretty well in kind of weather normalized especially industrial demand in West Virginia. At what point does this create a need for new infrastructure for you guys to build out and how do you think about kind of the timing of when that's needed, and whether its generation or significant transmission or even substation build out and B, how do you go about getting recovery on that? Chuck Jones : Well, of new businesses part of what we deal with every single year inside both our distribution and transmission budgets. In transmission there have been several fairly substantial projects in recent years, dealing with the shale gas development in West Virginia and Pennsylvania in particular, so we cover all of that within those existing capital budgets. We plan for a certain amount, it moves around each year, but new business as part of what we plan for every single year and there is no need to really I think contemplate anything exceptional there. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Andrew Weisel : I\u2019ve got a question on the treatment of writers, particularly in Ohio and Pennsylvania. So obviously the DMR court decision was an unfavorable one. My question is the money that you were planning to spend for that program, will you continue to spend it and just seek recovery through a more traditional Avenue notwithstanding, in the rate freeze in Ohio, but should I think of that CapEx money as still going to be spent or is it going to be maybe downsize or postponed and I understand you work within very wide range of the guidance. That's very clear. I'm just wondering about the outlook for the actual spending? Chuck Jones : I think you should think of it this way, I mean first of all, we're very disappointed, as I said in the court ruling. And we think we've made a rehearing application that has strong legal basis, but the cash that came from that rider it was factored into our capital plan, which I already said is going to be $2.8 billion to $3 billion each year for the next several years across the whole footprint. It's not going to affect what we spend on capital. It's not going to affect our growth rate over the period. In fact, nobody ever gave us credit for it anyway. And now, it's a big deal when it's not going to be there for two quarters, it's cash and we've worked hard to strengthen our balance sheet. Steve articulated, particularly the recent credit rating agency actions on our Ohio utilities with upgrades at all of them in a double upgrade at one of them. So the impact of the cash is we don't like it, but it's not going to take us off track from the story that we're telling you, which is 6% to 8% growth and solid movement in Ohio with the CR and the grid mod writers. Andrew Weisel : And then a similar parallel questions for Pennsylvania, you have the upcoming LTIIP filing for 2020 to 2024, should we, when you give the CapEx guidance for Pennsylvania you split it into stated in formula, should we think of maybe how can you give us a little sneak preview as to the size of what that filing might look like. Maybe I'll ask it that way. Chuck Jones : I don't think we can and we're still formulating it and until we know exactly which projects and which -- what our goals are going to be, we can't. But, but the range of capital that we give you is a range. That's large enough that if we decide to expand LTIIP it would take us to the top end of that range if we decide to keep it where it's at we may hang at the bottom of that range, but I think you can expect, as I've said somewhere on the order of $2.8 billion to $3 billion of capital invested in our companies over the next several years every year. Andrew Weisel : So if the outcome of that process is lower end of the reign type of number, would that just mean that you'll have to recover the capital through traditional rate case maybe a little sooner than if the LTIIP were larger, its that the way to think about it? Chuck Jones : No, I think what we file and LTIIP. We have the ability to recover through the desk and then ultimately, when we get to the point where it's 5% of revenues for our company, then we'll have to have a base rate case to continue, but I don't think you should expect us to tell you anything unless, unless that capital range that we've given you would change for some reason other than that we have that range to allow flexibility for us to manage the different things that come out throughout the year at all these companies. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Chuck Jones : All right. Well, it will be I think our shortest earnings call. I hope you weren't too bored. But it feels good to be where we're at. And thank you for your support. Look forward to talking to you with the third quarter call Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp Third Quarter 2019 Earning Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session fill follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may now begin. Irene Prezelj : Thanks, Rob. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today\u2019s discussion. Participants in today\u2019s call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thank you, Irene. And good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly five year track record of delivering on our commitments to you, our third quarter operating earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. As a reminder, when we held our second quarter call, we were waiting for our final outcome related to our Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider. Because of this, the third quarter guidance we provided to you included a $0.06 benefit from the DMR. While the rider was ultimately removed from our Ohio rate plan, I\u2019m pleased that we were able to offset its absence during the quarter through a combination of favorable weather compared to normal, the continued strong execution of our customer service oriented growth strategy and O&M discipline. For the full year, we\u2019re narrowing our 2019 operating earnings guidance to $2.50 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as the absence of the DMR in the second half. We\u2019re also providing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share and affirming our projection for 6% to 8% of compound annual operating earnings growth from 2018 through 2021.  I know you're anxious for us to communicate both our CAGR and equity plans beyond the 2018 to 2021 timeframe. We will provide this information as soon as it makes sense once we've completed our internal financial planning process. That should not be taken as any indication that either of these will ultimately be disappointing to the market. It's simply that I am very protective of our five year track record of meeting or exceeding every commitment we have made and I need to get the detailed planning in place before getting ahead of that process.  Now, let's review our progress with our customer focused growth strategies at our utilities. In late August, each of our four Pennsylvania utilities filed new Long-Term Infrastructure Improvement Plans or LTIIPs for the 2020 through 2024 period. The filings outline our plans to invest $572 million over that timeframe to accelerate infrastructure improvements and enhance service reliability for more than 2 million customers in Pennsylvania. These investments build on earlier improvement plans and included targeted projects that are designed to reduce the frequency of electric service interruptions for customers and shorten the duration of outages when they do occur.  Major initiatives will include; replacing older infrastructure with new poles, overhead lines, underground cables, substation equipment, network valves and manholes, reconfiguring circuits to minimize customers impacted by service interruptions and installing more advanced smart devices that can detect and isolate problems to help quickly restore power to impacted customers. The work outlined in the LTIIP programs accelerates infrastructure repairs, improvements and replacements while also introducing new investments to enhance our distribution, infrastructure and service reliability. We expect to recover the costs associated with the LTIIP through the DSIC rider mechanism.  We look forward working with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to have the plans approved by the end of the year, so work can begin in early 2020. Before we move from Pennsylvania, on our last call, we mentioned that we were in discussions to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2 to a subsidiary of EnergySolutions, LLC. This would remove any future nuclear decommission obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. In October, we signed that agreement, which includes transferring the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the associated liabilities and responsibility for decommissioning. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, we expect transfer to take place around the second half of 2020.  Turning to Ohio, we are beginning to implement our $516 million three-year Grid Modernization program, which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission in July. We're laying the groundwork to begin construction on these projects during the first quarter of next year. Our investments include the installation of 700,000 smart meters and related infrastructure, building an advanced distribution management system in our Ohio Edison Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison service areas, selling automated equipment on at least 200 distribution lines that can automatically isolate problems, prevent entire circuit outages and quickly restore electric service to customers, installing voltage regulating equipment on more than 200 circuits to provide energy efficiency benefits by optimizing voltage levels on the distribution grid.  In addition, we have committed to developing time varying rates that give customers the opportunity to reduce their monthly electric bill by using energy during off-peak periods. Together, these modernization projects are expected to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. As you\u2019ll recall, the Grid Mod order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we began implementing those tax savings for customers on September 1. Later this month, we expect to file plans with the PUCO to implement a decoupling mechanism in Ohio. As we discussed last quarter, decoupling breaks the link between utility revenue and the amount of electricity consumed by customers. This supports continued energy efficiency efforts while ensuring that our utilities have adequate resources to continue providing safe and reliable power to our customers. Our plan ensures that residential and commercial customers pay no more for base distribution service than was charged in 2018. After our filing the commission will have 60 days to review and approve the application. Moving to our transmission business, last week we filed a plan with FERC to our move New Jersey transmission assets onto a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1, 2020. The JCP&L transmission assets are currently on stated rates based on a settlement approved by FERC in February of 2018. A rate moratorium that was part of that settlement will expire on December 31. Our forward-looking formula rate plan would support energizing the future investment needs in New Jersey including approximately $175 million in capital spending planned for 2020. We expect an initial response from FERC by the end of December. Finally, in mid-October the bankruptcy court approved FES\u2019 plan of reorganization. FES has stated that it plans to emerge as an independent company with a new name by the end of this year. Now, let\u2019s look ahead to next week, when we will see many of you at EEI. At the meeting, we forward-looking to sharing with you our new corporate responsibility report and strategic plan. These reports support our commitment to increased transparency and engagement with investors, customers and other stakeholders, while providing a platform to track our progress as we transition to a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable energy future. Corporate Responsibility Report is aligned with the five pillars of our mission statement. It includes extensive detail on our initiatives from reducing the environmental impact of our operations and upholding high standards for corporate governance, to advancing employee and public safety while building a diverse and inclusive workplace.  The report includes our initial steps to provide data in alignment with the global reporting initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics as well as links to our policies. We plan to update the Corporate Responsibility Report annually including a data refresh next year in alignment with our 2019 annual report.  At EEI, we will also introduce our first public strategic plan using the foundation of our seven core values, the plan clearly articulates our vision for the next five years. It includes our approach to the rapid changes in our industry, fueled by involving customer expectations, emerging technologies and a lower-carbon economy. As we have continuously demonstrated over the past several years, FirstEnergy and our dedicated employees are prepared to meet any challenge as we work together to deliver energy for a brighter future.  Thank you for your time. We\u2019ve made great progress this year and we remain focused on executing our strategies for a sustainable customer focused growth that will continue to build value for our investors, customers, communities, and employees.  Now, I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the third quarter. Steve Strah : Good morning. It's good to speak with you today. Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, you will recall that because of the preferred shares issuance in January 2018, we have been presenting our operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis to ensure the best comparative view of our performance. As of August 1, all of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to common stock. Now, let's review our results. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share. Operating earnings were $0.76 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In the distribution business, earnings decreased compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of more moderate weather compared to the very hot conditions last summer. Results for the third quarter of 2019 also reflect the absence of the DMR in Ohio as well as higher expenses and depreciation. These factors were slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate and lower net financing costs.  Distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2018 both on a natural and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were 22% above normal for the third quarter, but 9% lower than the third quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 2.2% on an actual basis compared to the third quarter of 2018, but slightly increased on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see a very slight increase in weather-adjusted residential sales over the last 12 months.  Third quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 3.8% on an actual basis and 2.9% when adjusted for weather compared to the third quarter of 2018. This change was driven largely by lower demand in the education sector, partially due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as decreases in the food and beverage and real estate sectors. In our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 1% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel, automotive and chemical manufacturers, including the impact of the shutdown of the GM Lordstown plant earlier this year.  While we continue to watch these trends very closely, load for each customer segment remains in line with our forecast with bright spots including stable residential customer usage and modest growth in both residential and commercial customer accounts. Looking at our transmission business, earnings increased primarily as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to the continued investments in the energizing the future program. And in our corporate segment, third quarter results reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a third quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy foundation.  Before we open the call to your questions, we have a few other financial matters to discuss. First, it is our custom to providing estimate of the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment which is a non-cash item along with third quarter results. Based on market conditions as of September 30, we estimate that adjustment to be in the range of $400 million to $1 billion. As always, the final adjustment will be determined by the discount rate and asset returns at the end of the year.  Our return on assets currently stand at a solid 17% plus for 2019. Looking ahead, if these results hold through the end of the year, we would be on track to decrease our 2022 funding requirements by approximately $140 million. In addition, while the lower interest rate environment resulted in a higher pension liability, our funded status has slightly improved to 78% from 77% at year end 2018.  Second, during the third quarter we successfully expanded our corporate term loans and now have a $1 billion one-year facility and a $750 million two-year facility. We will evaluate refinancing some or all of these amounts into the capital market sometime next year. Finally, we met with the rating agencies earlier this quarter to review our progress on our goals as a fully regulated company with an improved risk profile. We expect all three to provide normal course updates on our entities possibly as soon as EEI. Thank you. We continue to be committed to executing our strategies and meeting our commitments to investors. Now let\u2019s take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shahriar Pourreza : Just a quick question on the pension. So, with pension coming in better than expected, can you just maybe talk a little bit about how you think about the flexibility that could sort of provide if these results kind of hold i.e lowering future equity needs post \u201821. You\u2019ve talked about pension as being one of those levers versus using that flexibility to deploy additional capital. So any thoughts on how we should think about the incremental flexibility that you could get? Chuck Jones : I think the way you think about is Shar as what Steve said in his prepared remarks is that we don\u2019t have no required pension contribution through 2022, so -- and it\u2019s reduced our 2022 requirement by about $140 million. So between now and 2022, I don't think it has any direct impact on our business. It just has an impact on the funding requirement that we will ultimately see out there in the future. Steve Strah : Shar, this is Steve. Just to put a little finer point on that. Our next required funding requirement is in 2022 and that looks to be $240 million. Shahriar Pourreza : And just lastly on JCP&L and sort of the transmission opportunity there. As you guys look to roll to formula rates, can you just remind us if that makes deploying capital more attractive or you\u2019re sort of already had that full run rate there? So is there opportunities to deploy additional capital by going to formula rates? Chuck Jones : I think formula rates obviously are our preferred mechanism. They provide the benefit of being very transparent to investors, very transparent to customers and regulators. I think they clearly result in a return of cash based -- both return on and return of capital investment in a more timely fashion to allow additional reinvestment back into future projects. So we talked about what we have planned for 2020 in JCP&L. But as we go forward, obviously, I think transmission formula rates are our preferred mechanism, and we will have now pretty much all of our company except for the former Allegheny transmission system on formula rates once FERC approves us. Operator : The next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the more detailed assumptions embedded in the guidance, especially for '20. What are you thinking about with respect to the decoupling filing in Ohio? I suppose, how are you thinking about reflecting that in '20 to the extent to which it is already? I guess that that might be more of a risk reduction profile than the earnings impact, but I'd be curious. And then related to that, how do you think about '19 and the inclusion? I thought there was a potential for a true-up depending on the specific timing here. If you can elaborate? Chuck Jones : Well, I'll answer the last part first. I don't think it's going to have any impact on 2019. We expect to file the decoupling rates and the commission has 60 days to approve them. So, they're likely won't approve them this year, I don't think. As far as how I look at it, I think it establishes a fixed cost for the base distribution costs in Ohio. Obviously, the DCR and the Grid Mod riders are on top of that. But by establishing the fixed base, it's going to accomplish what the legislature tried to do. It allows us to continue to promote energy efficiency with our customers so that they can get the benefit of that without impacting our base revenues.  I think you pointed out the risk piece of it. It fixes our base revenues and essentially it takes about one-third of our company and I think makes it somewhat recession-proof. So, I get a question a lot about where I'm worried about a future recession. It's 2 million customers in Ohio that this is going to help make sure that that doesn't impact us. And I think Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Are you assuming it or it's unclear? Chuck Jones : Assuming what? Julien Dumoulin-Smith : The decoupling filing in '20. Chuck Jones : Yes. It will be -- I'm -- we're assuming it will get approved in 2020. Yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : And then related, if you can just clarify the last question just a little bit further. The funding requirement in '22 for pension is $240 million or is not? Sorry, I apologize about the back and forth, there. I just want to clarify that. Steve Strah : It stands at $240 million right now based on our projections, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : How do you think about -- or let me try to back up here and not be too granular. How do you think about the overall earnings growth trajectories enabled by that level of equity funding as you kind of rethink and rebase going forward? And I know I'm not -- hopefully, I'm not getting too far ahead of your more strategic thoughts here, but I'd be curious. Chuck Jones : Julien, I'm not sure I even understood that question to be honest with you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : How do you think about rebasing on a going forward basis as you roll forward next year, given what seems like a better pension outlook? Chuck Jones : I don't think it's going to affect our plans for growth in the future in any fashion, Julien. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we'll get to giving you the CAGR and our equity plans when I'm comfortable with it. To plan on a company like ours three to four years out, it's a challenging process and it involves 10 operating companies, including our transmission business, look at project by project, what they plan to execute out in 2022 and beyond. It involves a lot of analysis around things like market performance and interest rates and growth economy versus recession economy and we're doing all that right now and I learned a term in engineering school called swag. I've never been willing to apply that to what I give to you. And I'm very protective of this record that we've established of every time we've given a commitment to you in the last five years, including the commitment on a major restructuring initiative, we've hit it. And we're getting close, but it's just a complex process and as soon as we're done, we'll communicate what the future beyond 2021 looks like. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Praful Mehta : So, maybe just on the growth, if your guidance as we looked at 6% to 7% or 6% to 8% growth and you take the midpoint of that and imply what it means for 2021 and you compare it against midpoint of 2020, suggests a growth of about 5%, 5.5% between '20 and '21. So, I guess, just the slope of that growth, just wanted to check, is that just more of what it is between '20 and '21 but not an indication of long-term growth? Are you still comfortable with the 6% to 8% longer term from there? Just wanted to get any color on that would be helpful. Chuck Jones : Well, I think I've said twice now. I'm not going to give you what we expect our CAGR to be beyond that. But I also said, I don't think you're going to be disappointed when we ultimately do give it. Praful Mehta : I'll take that. Maybe moving to the credit side, you guys mentioned that you had constructive dialog with the rating agencies. Is there, in your view, going to be a lower threshold of what is required given the improved business risk profile? And also connected to that, how do you think about the whole co-leverage at this point? Is there a certain level that you're looking to maintain as a percentage of total debt? Chuck Jones : Well, I'll let the rating agency speak for themselves. We do talk with them frequently and they are very aware of our plans. As far as whole co-leverage, I wish it wasn't what it is. But at the same point, as I've discussed in the past, we are comfortable that we can deploy about $3 billion of capital investment in our transmission and distribution system. That's what's driving the growth of this company and do it in a way where we will eventually grow into a stronger balance sheet. We could deploy back some of that cash towards maybe some of the holding company debt. But I just don't think that's the right thing to do for shareholders over the long-term. So we're going to continue to take our cash investment in growth, and then, as I said, we'll tell you what that's going to look like for the future coming up soon. Praful Mehta : And just one final thing, on Slide 24 of your Factbook, you have the weather-adjusted distribution deliveries and the growth rates. It looks like most of the states are negative except West Virginia, which looks like meaningfully constructive and positive, especially on the industrial side. So maybe, if you can touch on what's driving the other states and what specifically in West Virginia supporting that growth? Steve Strah : This is Steve Strah. In West Virginia, the growth is primarily driven by the shale gas industry. It continues to be very resilient and seems immune to any of the discussion that we've heard about with regard to recessions or the trade tariff issue. So, West Virginia is really driven by that. Overall, as we have talked in our past, we project load growth in general, however, to be flat to slightly positive. And that's really just our six-state territory and where we see the economy going. I would also remind you that within our business plan, we take a conservative approach to these projections, and we've proven over time to be very accurate in doing it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Stephen Byrd : I just wanted to follow up on the New Jersey filing that you put in. You mentioned, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you expected a response from FERC by the end of the year. I'm just not that familiar with this process. Is this something that's fairly procedural and shouldn't be subject to link the review or are there sort of elements that could require more protracted deliberation? Chuck Jones : I think it's a pretty simple case. I wouldn't see any reason that FERC couldn't act on it. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And then just following up on Shar's question just in terms of the benefits there. I appreciate what you had said, Chuck, in terms of just contemporaneous return being able to redeploy more capital. Is there a greater potential for further spending in the state? Do you see -- and maybe away from this filing specifically, but just other objectives, longer-term projects or items that are sort of on your longer-term wish list that you might think about further after this filing? Chuck Jones : Well, I think across our entire footprint, we have already identified about $20 billion worth of transmission projects that we believe need to be completed. So, it's just a matter of, as we look at how do we deploy nearly $3 billion of capital every year, there is a rack and stack process that we go through that prioritizes where that money is spent for the most effective benefit for customers. And if in the end, it means that we would spend more in New Jersey, we'll spend it in New Jersey, but we have formula rates in Pennsylvania and Ohio also. So, it's more how are the projects stack up that drive us where to spend. I don't think you should expect us to materially expend more capital than what we've committed to, which is around $3 billion a year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Patterson : Just the FERC has put out a few orders in the last couple of months that seem to be oriented towards increasing competition or cost containment with respect to transmission projects sort of per quarter 1,000 sort of follow-up kind of stuff, I guess, is the best way to describe it. And as you know, there is also some procedural stuff going on with stakeholder process at PJM. And I was just wondering what your thoughts were about your perspective on these orders and these efforts? Chuck Jones : Well, I think, PJM, in particular, has a very transparent process already that affects these supplemental projects. And since that's where we operate, I'll comment on that. Because it's transparent, it's caused some of the questioning that goes on. But I will tell you that the projects that we do in transmission today, about half of the money is spent on PJM RTEP projects already. So those are already projects that PJM are saying are needed for future reliability reasons. And the rest fall into the category of what I call good asset management practice. And I think for the regulator, whether that be FERC or even the state commissions, to try to get too involved in how we do asset management as a business would be a mistake, because we're the one ultimately responsible for making sure that this grid is reliable and resilient and able to perform for customers, not just today, but for the long-term and the projects that we're doing just fall into the typical asset management decisions you make when you're running a bulk electric -- a piece of the bulk electric system and a system that serves 6 million customers. Paul Patterson : Okay. So generally speaking, you'll see these efforts bringing about any more competition into the space that you're currently expecting to invest in. Is that the right way to think about it? Chuck Jones : Not as it relates to what we're doing at FirstEnergy. The average project size inside this $1.2 billion of transmission spend, the average project size for us outside of the RTEP projects is about a $1 million to $1.5 million. These are small projects. I can't believe anybody is going to really be interested in trying to bid them and I would point out they're competitive bid already, because we competitive bid -- if we're putting in a new circuit breaker, we competitive bid that with numerous suppliers. If we're using a contractor to do that work, we competitive bid that work. So these projects are already competitive bid. And I don't think you're going to see anybody else that has the buying power or the capability that we have to competitive bid them cheaper anyway. Paul Patterson : Okay. And the other projects, you don't think are going to be subject to it either, the larger ones? Chuck Jones : Some of them are already subject to that. But no, I don't see it changing significantly from the way we do business today. Operator : The next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lapides : I know a lot of people want to ask about 2029 guidance, but I'd actually like to focus on next year first. Your transmission guidance is actually implying a pretty low growth rate relative to the midpoint of your 2019 transmission guidance, right? Your 2019 range had about $0.85 as a midpoint, your current guidance for 2020 transmission, a couple of cents higher. Is there a significant slowdown in transmission growth if that's starting to kick in as law of big numbers starting the impact kind of the ability to grow at kind of within the range, the 6% to 8% range? I'm just curious how you're thinking about the growth at the transmission business over the next couple of years and especially into 2020 over '19? Jason Lisowski : Yes, Michael, this is Jason Lisowski, Chief Accounting Officer. So you're right, in 2019, we did have a little bit of additional O&M in our stated rate at transmission companies. So that was about a penny, penny and a half of additional O&M. So that reduced the '19 from the original guidance. But as you look into 2020, you'll see in the Factbook on Page 56 that we are showing about $0.04 increase year-over-year and that's the natural transmission growth that Chuck and Steve were talking about. But we do have a little bit higher interest expense mostly at FE transmission that holding company there issuing some additional debt. So we have some additional interest there. Michael Lapides : And then when you think about rate base growth in transmission, do you think rate base growth in the transmission business is a 6% to 8% level or is it even higher than that? Chuck Jones : It's higher than that. I think in the 10% to 11% range. Michael Lapides : And then one last thing for cash flow. Can you remind us going forward what if any cash payments do you have to make to the FES stayed effectively over the next couple of years? As part of the original settlement there, what's left? Steve Strah : Michael, this is Steve Strah. We have a $225 million payment that's due to FES upon emergence. We will also at that time issue a tax note that will be due in 2022 for $628 million. That's our current plan and those are the commitments that have already been subject to being made public. So we're just going to continue to follow the agreement. Michael Lapides : Got it. And can you walk me through how the cash flow in the accounting metrics for the tax note will work? Jason Lisowski : Yes. Michael, this is Jason Lisowski again. So that's going to be issued as a note, and then once it's paid, that's when it will come through. So it's obviously non-cash until we actually pay it in 2022. Operator : The next question is from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your questions. Charles Fishman : Thank you. Just one question. Corporate other up about 10% '20 over '19. I see what the Factbook says. Missing in the Factbook is any general corporate expenses. So, I'm making the assumption that the downsizing with respect to FES is going -- or went to plan. And then, any more color you can provide on those other two bullet points on the Factbook, the income tax rate going higher and looks like higher interest expense too? Thank you. Jason Lisowski : Yes. Charles, this is Jason Lisowski again. So our corporate O&M expenses really predominantly get allocated out to the distribution and transmission. So only think really left at corporate is any tax planning initiatives that we have and the holding company interest. And so to your point on '19 to '20, we did have a little bit of a tax benefit, some discrete items as we got the tax return for '18 finalized in '19. We're not expecting those types of benefits to go forward. So you are seeing a little bit higher the tax rate and a hurt, if you will, '19 to '20, from the effective tax rate. Charles Fishman : And what about interest expense? That was listed in the Factbook. Jason Lisowski : Yes. So, the interest expense is just related to our holding company debt. Charles Fishman : More debt, higher rates or? Chuck Jones : No. It wouldn't be more debt. I mean, interest rates are fairly flat, if not going lower from the term loan. So, I'd have to actually go in and take a look to find out what's driving it. Charles Fishman : Okay. But the important thing is we shouldn't expect that kind of acceleration going forward? Chuck Jones : Not at all. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Fremont : Thanks. If I look back to your second quarter disclosure, it looked as if you were expecting sort of the underfunded pension position to improve by roughly $500 million. Is the update today should we assume that, that $500 million improvement does not take place at least for at the end of this year? Chuck Jones : I'm not sure what you're looking at in the second quarter disclosures, Paul, but... Paul Fremont : I think, you go from 77% funded, this is Slide 59 of the second quarter Factbook, to 82% funded in 2019. And now it looks like, I think from your disclosure or from what you were saying on your slide, your improvement is not 82%, it's to 78%. Steve Strah : So, Paul, it's Steve. So the $500 million voluntary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter is the driver. So we went from 77% at the end of '18 to 78% funded status, but the other piece of this is the pension liability increased by $1.5 billion. So we went from $9.1 billion at the end of '18 to about $10.6 billion at the end of September. Paul Fremont : Right. So when you end the year, the underfunded pension should still be in the range of $2.1 billion at least based on where interest rates are today, right? Steve Strah : If everything holds, the underfunded pension position will be around $2.3 billion. So, it will be up $200 million versus where we ended 2018. Paul Fremont : Got it. Okay. And then on the transfer of the transmission, do you need New Jersey approval or is it purely FERC approval? Eileen Mikkelsen : Good morning. This is Eileen Mikkelsen and I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. And FERC is responsible for approving the JCP&L transmission transfer to a forward formula rate. Paul Fremont : Okay. So there is no New Jersey approval involved? Eileen Mikkelsen : New Jersey can certainly participate in the process, but not involved in the approval of the applications. Paul Fremont : And then on the decoupling in Ohio, aside from rebasing, does decoupling give you any type of assumed percentage increase on a go-forward basis or is decoupling essentially just sort of a weather assumption? Chuck Jones : I think it's fixing our base rates and what it does compared to anything else is dependent on what you think is going to happen with the economy, what you think is going to happen with weather, what you think is going with happen with energy efficiency, et cetera, et cetera. So what it really does is it locks in our fixed base revenues at 2018 levels and I don't know how to compare it to anything else. So that part is going to be a certainty and then the DMR and the Grid Mod is on top of that as we make the investments that we're making in the Ohio companies. Paul Fremont : Okay. But aside from going back to 2018, we should not assume percentage increases on a go forward basis associated with that? Chuck Jones : No. It's going to fix them until our next base distribution rate case in Ohio. Operator : The next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Weisel : My first question is on rate cases. The Factbook now shows that you're continuously reviewing considerations for rate cases in New Jersey and West Virginia. That's a bit of a change in the wording. Are you intending to signal a change in the messaging and maybe any high level thoughts on when those next rate cases might come in those two states? Chuck Jones : I wasn't intending to signal anything but I'll have Eileen update you on what we're looking at as far as future rate cases. Eileen Mikkelsen : Thanks, Chuck. This is Eileen Mikkelsen and again really as it states in the Factbook, we are continuously reviewing the investments that we're making in our jurisdictions, the recovery associated with those investments and using that information to make our best judgments about when it's appropriate to file for future rate cases. Andrew Weisel : Okay. So you're not suggesting that it might come sooner, given the change in wording. Is that fair? Eileen Mikkelsen : I think the change in wording was really trying to be more precise about the process we use to make that evaluation. Andrew Weisel : Good to hear. Then second, I'm hoping you could help me reconcile some of the guidance updates. Again, in the Factbook here, it looks like you -- on the transmission side, you increase your rate base forecast by around 2%, but the CapEx figures are unchanged. And then it's sort of the opposite on distribution where the CapEx numbers are now at the high-end of the prior ranges, yet the rate base forecasts have actually come down a little bit. Can you maybe just walk us through how to reconcile those two things that seem a little bit at odds? Eileen Mikkelsen : This is Eileen Mikkelsen. We did an evaluation as we always do looking at rate base and particularly as it relates to West Virginia and Maryland, we refined our assumptions, our separation studies associated with accumulated deferred income taxes as well as the distribution versus transmission assets. So that's what you see is kind of that re-racking and stacking associated with that further refinement of that analysis. Andrew Weisel : So, certain assets were switched basically from one rate base to a different rate base? Eileen Mikkelsen - FirstEnergy Corp. As well as certain balances associated with accumulated deferred income taxes, yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Sophie Karp : Just one conceptually to ask you about how as the regulatory mechanisms evolve across a few of your jurisdictions, you're moving transmission in New Jersey to similar rates, there is decoupling in Ohio. If that makes may be capital allocation to these distribution utilities, do these jurisdictions are really more attractive versus transmission growth in the longer term? Chuck Jones : Well, I think we're deploying capital where it's best fit to serve our customers better. And it right now out of average, call it $3 billion. About $1.2 billion of that is in transmission, $1.8 billion is in distribution. I don't think you're going to see that change a lot, but we clearly do prefer very transparent rate mechanisms. We mentioned on the call that we just filed another long-term infrastructure plan in Pennsylvania. The DCR and the Grid Mod in Ohio are very transparent riders. We have utilized the new rider in New Jersey for the first time starting last year and then we have transmission formula rates. And that $3 billion, a little over 60% of that is being deployed in these mechanisms that are very transparent and return cash back to the business quicker for reinvestment. Sophie Karp : And on Maryland, real quick, smaller part of the overall picture, but what are your thoughts on -- are you going to participate in the potential multi-year rate filings there? Eileen Mikkelsen : This is Eileen Mikkelsen. And we have been actively participating in those stakeholder discussions relative to the multi-year rate plan rules in Maryland. We expect those final rules to be issued beginning of 2020 and then we'll evaluate the application of those to our Maryland distribution utility at that time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Two questions. These are a little bit housekeeping, probably Steve-oriented. One, what's the tax rate for income statement purposes you're embedding in guidance for 2020 and how should we think about whether you're paying cash taxes? That's the first question. And then a follow-up, coming back on the Transmission thing, you're -- I'm looking at Slide 13, you're forecasting 11% rate base growth CAGR but you're forecasting EPS growth of, like not quite 5%. I'm just trying to true-up, is all of that just intermediate holding company leverage that's weighing on that growth or is there something else in there in 2020 I'm not thinking about? Jason Lisowski : Yes. Michael, this is Jason. So on your first question, if you look at Slide 56 of the Factbook in the lower right-hand corner, we note what our assumed consolidated and business unit segment tax rates. So we're expecting in 2020 to be around 21% to 24%. I'll just also mentioned that Charles had a question on the corp other, the interest expense that's increasing, that's predominantly because of that FES note that $628 million that will be issued upon their emergence. So we're assuming that will be issued at the end of this year, so we'll have that interest cost next year. And then going back on the cash taxpayer, we right now do not expect to be a federal cash taxpayer through at least 2024. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow-up from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Gregg Orrill : In Ohio, where do you stand versus achieving the energy efficiency mandates from the legislation? And secondly, are there any additional details around the timing of the FES re-emergence process? Chuck Jones : Eileen will take the first half and I'll take the second. Eileen Mikkelsen : Thank you, Chuck. With respect to the energy efficiency standards, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recently released a report really suggesting that all the utilities in the state were very close to that target and in fact opened up a comment period to seek comments from folks relative to what happens when we achieve that House Bill 6 mandated 17.5% level. Chuck Jones : And as far as the FES process goes, it's not our process at this point. The court approved the restructuring plan. Every aspect of it as it affects FirstEnergy has been clarified. But what they've said is they expect to get the nuclear licenses transferred yet this year and emerge yet this year. Operator : Thank you. So thank you all. We\u2019d had a greater quarter. Look forward to seeing you all next week at EEI. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

And welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp, Fourth Quarter 2019 Earning Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you Ms. Prezelj, you may now begin. Irene Prezelj : Thanks Doug. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings.  We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website, along with the presentation which supports today\u2019s discussion. Participants in today\u2019s call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thank you, Irene, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. 2019 was another great year and a step forward for FirstEnergy, marked by solid execution on initiatives that benefit our customers, shareholders, communities and our company. One of the accomplishments that makes us most proud is our record of delivering on the commitments we made to the financial community. This morning we announce 2019 GAAP earnings of $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.58 per share, which is at the top-end of the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call.  By executing on our customer focus growth strategy, along with some benefits from third quarter weather, we successfully mitigated the absence of the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider in the second half of the year.  We reached five years of consistently meeting or exceeding the mid-point of the quarterly guidance that we provided. The culture of execution and ownership that our leadership team has established at FirstEnergy is one you can continue to count on as we improve service for our customers and communities and deliver strong results for our shareholders. Two years ago we introduced our first long term growth rate projection of 6% to 8% compounded annually from 2018 to 2021. In the first year we hit it out of the park. Our 2019 growth versus our original 2018 guidance was 12%, excluding both the Ohio DMR and weather impacts.  Our culture of strong execution is clearly evident and has gotten us off to a great start, on what now is a five year growth plan, and we're looking forward to another solid year in 2020 as we reaffirm our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.  I continue providing investors with clarity into our long term expectations for earnings growth. In November we extended the CAGR at a rate of 5% to 7% through 2023. As we\u2019ve discussed, this projection includes plans to issue a modest amount of equity, up to a total of $600 million annually starting in 2022. When this happens, it will represent the first infusion of equity into our growth initiatives since early 2018, and we will have invested approximately $12 billion in our business during that period. By successfully executing on our regulated growth strategies, we have driven strong results for investors. In 2019 our total shareholder return was 34%, placing our stock within the top quartile of the EEI Index. The TSR over the last two years, 2018 and 2019 was 71%, making FirstEnergy the number one stock in EEI Index over that period.  Over the past several years the rating agencies have acknowledged our transition to a fully regulated company with primarily Transmission and Distribution operations resulting in a lower risk profile. In 2019 we received numerous ratings upgrades across the FirstEnergy family, as well as at the parent level.  With the November upgrade from Fitch, we are making solid progress towards our goal to achieve solid BBB ratings at all three agencies. While we remain focused on making steady improvements to our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to support our plans for growth, including the extended CAGR and associated equity issuance. In 2019 we continued executing on our long term, customer focus growth plans. This included an annual capital investment of approximately $3 billion in our transmission and distribution infrastructure, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.  In our Transmission business we successfully completed year six of our Energizing the Future investment program, with more than $6.8 billion in investments during that period. As we reported to you throughout 2019, our customers in the ATSI footprint are seeing measurable reliability improvements, including a nearly 50% reduction in equipment related transmission outages, as there is all the work we're doing to modernize the Grid. As we continue extending the program into our eastern footprint, we expect those customers to experience similar benefits. We took another important step in 2019, the continued expansion of our Energizing the Future Initiative. In December FERC accepted our application to move JCP&L\u2019s Transmission assets in to forward-looking formula rates effective January 1, 2020 subject to refund. With this change, nearly 90% of our transmission business is on forward looking formula rights.  The forward looking rate structure in New Jersey supports our plan for approximately $175 million and customer focused capital spending on the JCP&L transmission system this year. On the distribution side of our business, last month we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to implement a decoupling mechanism for our residential and commercial customers in the state. The commission also removed the requirement that our Ohio companies filed a distribution-rate case by 2024. Decoupling provides rate transparency and stability for these customers, while providing revenue certainty to our Ohio companies. Rates for 2019 and each year thereafter will be reconciled to 2018 baseline revenues and adjusted through a conservation support rider. There is no impact from the rider on 2019 earnings. That adjustment will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020. Going forward the rider will be reflected in current period results.  Also in Ohio, our utilities are moving forward with the $516 million three year Grid Modernization program that was approved by the PUCO in July. As we\u2019ve discussed, the plan includes modernization projects designed to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage.  We expect to complete approximately $170 million of Grid Mod work this year. This initial phase includes deploying 250,000 smart meters to Ohio customers, implementing time varying rates and installing more than 600 reclosers and capacitors on the Electric Distribution System, which will help automatically isolate problems, prevent entire circuit lockouts and quickly restore electric service to customers. In Pennsylvania, we completed work on the initial phase of our original $350 million long term infrastructure improvement plan in 2019. Last month the Public Utility Commission approved our LTIP 2, spanning 2020 through 2024. The LTIP 2 program includes a $572 million investment across our four Pennsylvania utilities to accelerate distribution infrastructure projects in the state.  The improvement plan for each utility complements the work we already perform on our distribution network to reduce the number and duration of outages experienced by our 2 million Pennsylvania customers. Investments include replacing older polls, lines and fuses, installing new substation equipment, network boats and manual covers and reconfiguring circuits. Approximately $120 million of the work is expected to be completed in 2020, across our Pennsylvania service area, with the remainder spent over the next four years. The cost associated with the service reliability investments are expected to be recovered through the Pennsylvania distribution system improvement charge.  You recall that earlier in 2019 the Maryland Public Service Commission approved our rate case and Electric Distribution Investment surcharge and a five year electric vehicle pilot program, while The New Jersey Board of Utilities approved are JCP&L Reliability Plus Initiative. Together, these initiatives position us to improve service to our customers as we enable new technologies and the Grid of the future.  Later this month, we plan to file a distribution rate \u2013 base-rate case in New Jersey. We will seek to recover increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our customers, along with recovery of Storm costs incurred over the last few years.  To sum up my discussion of our Regulated Investments, I want to remind you that after the conversion to JCP&L Transmission assets to a forward-looking formula rate, more than 60% of our annual investment will now be in formula rates and distribution riders, making our investment profile very transparent.  Finally, I hope you've taken the time to review our five year strategic plan and our corporate responsibility report, which were both published to our website in the fall. These reports are an important element of our commitment to provide transparency and enhanced engagement with our stakeholders. They also offer a platform to track progress on our goals and strategies, including ESG initiatives such as our carbon reduction target, average stability, a more diverse and inclusive work force, and our ISS Governance Score. We're excited to recently earn the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index designation for the second consecutive year and last month we were named the Forbes list of the best employers for diversity. In addition, we are one of only four companies in our sector to achieve the best possible rating in the ISS Governance Quality score. We will refresh the data in our corporate responsibility report when we publish our annual report next month and we intend to update the strategic plan later this year to maintain a five year outlook.  I think you will see that we are continuing to drive FirstEnergy toward our mission of become a premier forward thinking electric utility that our stakeholders can trust and believe in. As I mentioned earlier, we are affirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We are also pleased to affirm our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021 and 5% to 7% extending through 2023. In addition, we are introducing operating earnings guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2020.  Thank you for your time. We had a great year and we look forward to building on our progress. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve for a review of the fourth quarter and 2019. Steve Strah : Good morning; it's great to speak with you today. All reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available in the strategic and financial highlights document that is posted to our website. We also posted and updated fact book to the website this morning, which includes additional supporting materials related to 2022 and 2023, such as our capital in load forecasts.  Now let's review our results. We reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of $0.20 per share, driven by our annual non-cash pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. I'll spend a few minutes discussing our pension performance later in my comments.  Adjusting for special items, fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.55 per share, which is above the mid-point of the guidance we provided on our last earnings call.  In the distribution business, earnings were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. O&M expenses were lower this quarter compared to the same period in 2018 and distribution revenues were higher. This offset the absence of the Ohio DMR and the impact of more mild temperatures across our footprint. Total distribution earnings increased due to incremental writer revenue in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but customer usage decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 on both an actual and weather adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 2% below normal and 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 1.3% on an actual basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, but increased slightly on a weather adjusted basis.  In the commercial customer class, fourth quarter sales decreased 4.3% on an actual basis and 3.5%, when adjusted for whether compared to the same period in 2018.  Finally in our industrial class, fourth quarter loads decreased 2.4%. While the shale gas sector continues to grow, we saw our sales decline in every other major sector, including steel, automotive, coal and chemical.  Looking at our load trends for the full year of 2019, we are encouraged to see the stability in the residential sector where we've recorded two consecutive years of modest growth in weather adjusted sales. However, full year 2019 sales to commercial customers were down 2% compared to 2018. Drivers include weaker economic conditions, energy efficiency and distributed generation measures initiated by customers in the education and food and beverage sectors, and lower usage from the real-estate sector related to decreases in new construction.  While it\u2019s widely recognized that the U.S. has entered into a manufacturing recession, the impacts of that slump, combined with a couple large plant closings resulted in a 1.7% decrease in deliveries to industrial customers for the year.  Turning back to fourth quarter results for the Transmission business, earnings increased primarily due to higher rate babe at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the energizing the future program. And in our Corporate segment, fourth quarter results primarily reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 contribution to the First Energy Foundation.  Before we open the call to your questions, let's spend a moment on a few other financial matters, starting with the pension performance and its impact on our future funding requirements. In 2019 our pension plan investments produced a return on assets of 20.3%, far exceeding our original assumption of 5.7%. This superior plan performance, coupled with the low discount rate of 3.34% produced two outcomes.  First, our 2019 non cash after tax pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment is approximately $480 million, which is at the lower end of the range we provided in October.  Second, our pension plan funding requirements for 2022 and 2023 have decreased significantly. A year ago our 2022 funding requirement stood at $382 million. As a result of the robust plan returns last year, this is decreased to $159 million, and for 2023 our funding requirement has decreased to $375 million compared to $455 million at the end of 2018. As we indicated during the third quarter, the lower interest rate environment has resulted in a higher pension liability, but our funded status has improved to 79% compared to 77% at the end of 2018. As you know, we normally only mark the pension at year end, but we will need to remeasure it again when FES emerges from bankruptcy. Assuming that they emerge in the first quarter of this year, we anticipate an after tax, non-cash loss of up to $400 million based on the discount rate and pension performance.  Finally, our corporate liquidity continues to be strong with $3.5 billion of undrawn credit facilities and approximately $465 million in cash. This cash position, plus a portion of revolver borrowings will fund the final payment of $853 million to FES upon their emergence. Please keep in mind, 2020 will be a transitional year from a rating agency perspective, as this final FES payment will impact our credit metrics. However, when you exclude this payment, our 2020 credit metrics will be compliant with the thresholds established by each of the three rating agencies.  With respect to equity, we have no incremental needs through 2021 and as we told you at EEI, we plan the issue up to $600 million of equity annually in 2022 and 2023. The ultimate amount will be determined by a number of factors, including customer load, storm activity, weather trends, pension performance and rating agency metrics.  Thank you. We are proud of our results in 2019 and we look forward to continuing our strong progress this year. Now, let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Gordon : Hey, thanks. Congrats on a good year guys. Chuck Jones : Good morning Greg. Greg Gordon : A couple of questions. Looking at the cash flow disclosure you gave, there's some changes relative to what the outlook looked like in the last fact book, but I guess when I unpack it, it looks like the major changes, just the delay in the cash payment to the FES creditors and a decision to pay them out in cash rather than take on that tax note associated with the prior settlement. So can you just walk through \u2013 I know the former is just timing, but the decision making on the latter and why you see that as value accretive? Steve Strah : Hey Greg, it\u2019s Steve Strah. So the way you\u2019ve explain it is exactly what happened. We were planning to make the payment in 2019, assuming an FES emergence at that point, but obviously that didn't happen. It's going to happen here sometime in February, at which point in time we will fund the cash payment of $225 million and we will also pay what we were previously thinking would be issued as a tax note, we will also pay that tax note in cash. And so from an economics perspective it just makes more sense for us to use cash-on-hand to pay-off that tax note now, rather than have to deal with it by the end of 2022 and refinance it again at that point. Chuck Jones : And I'll just emphasize that point, that means we won't be answering questions about FES for the next five years so. Greg Gordon : No, we're all happy about that. Two more questions; as it pertains to just you know obviously a lot of moving parts when you think about the \u201822 and beyond equity, potential equity needs, you've set up to $600 million. But one of the pieces that looks like its gotten better is, pension performance means future pension contributions are down by a little over $300 million. So all things equal, does that mean that your equity needs are down by potentially up to $300 million? Chuck Jones : Well, I would say this, we put a range in there that allows for flexibility for lots of things to change between now and then. The range of zero to 600, including the drip is a range that we expect to stay in. I don't think it should be extracted that it will be $600 million every single year, but it will be within that range, depending on where we are at when we get to that point. Greg Gordon : Right, that\u2019s a fair enough answer. My final question is, I know this has no direct economic impact on your \u2013 definitely it has an impact on your customers. What do you think the Ohio government's response is going to be to the FERC decision on the MOPR rules with regard to, the capacity market? Is it possible that the state of Ohio will consider leaving PJM throughout FRR? Chuck Jones : I would say that the state of Ohio has already kind of talked about their disappointment with the PJM market, and their intention to use the next year or so to look at energy policy for the state. The last time they looked at energy policy in the state was 20 years ago, 1999, when the Senate Bill 3D regulated the state.  I think there's a lot of disappointment that some of the goals they thought would be achieved through that, never materialized. I think there were some unintended consequences that happened that they didn't expect to happen and so I think they're going to fully look at everything, from how the utilities interact with the public utilities commission to you know how we insure a long term secure supply of generation for Ohio customers, to how we get back to Ohio being a state that has an energy surplus as opposed to a shortfall.  I think there's a lot of things they are going to look at, but beyond that, you know what our intention is, is we\u2019ll be at the table helping where they want help, providing our guidance where they want guidance, and expressing our views where we feel strongly about certain things should go a certain way. Greg Gordon : Do you feel strongly about FRR one way or the other? Chuck Jones : I don't, I'm not in the generation business anymore, so \u2013 but I feel strongly that we need to come up with a long term solution for customers that ensures they have adequate, fuel secure, cost effective generation, not just right now. And I mean its no \u2013 my views on these markets has not changed. A one your capacity signaled three years out and the next hourly short run marginal cost signal is no way to do this business for the long haul and they are failing. And so something needs to be done, whether Ohio decides to step up and do something, is up to them, but I do not think the market as constructed today is going to provide the best long term outcome for my customers. Greg Gordon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi guys! Chuck Jones : Hi Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi, so maybe just firstly clarify something more specific, on page 11 you have regulatory charges for the fourth quarter in the distribution business, which is being adding \u2013 which is adding back about $0.15 of earnings to get to more operating earnings. What specifically does that $0.15 relate to? Jason Lisowski : Yeah Praful, this is Jason Lisowski, Chief Accounting Officer. That is related to a FERC order that reallocates some transmission expenses across our utilities. And as you may recall, in Ohio we at the time in the past did not have the ability to pass those on to customers. So it ended up being actually a refund and a credit back to the wild companies, and since in the past we were excluding them from our non-GAAP operating earnings, when you receive that credit, we consistently also exclude it from our non-GAAP operating earnings. Praful Mehta : I got you. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then in terms of longer term growth, the \u201821 to \u201823 earnings profile based on the group that you've talked about looks like a 4.5% earnings growth, if I just were to use the math for the last two years. I'm assuming some of that is obviously a slower rate base growth and then the equity need. Can you just walk through or help us understand what kind of rate base growth you're assuming for the last two years in the current forecast and like how much dilution, you expect versus strong rate base to EPS. Chuck Jones : Well, I'll answer this. That CAGR that we\u2019ve given you have for the next five years is the CAGR that we expect to hit, which is 6% to 8% for the first three and then 5% to 7% after that. I\u2019ll let Jason try to walk you through the rate base accounting that gets to that, but as I've told you many times, when you look at our company from the outside in, trying to line-up what you look at with the regulatory accounting that goes on, because it's no longer just the same simple math that it used to be. It\u2019s difficult, but we'll have Jason try. Jason Lisowski : Yeah, if you look at the fact book that we released this morning, we actually do show our expected rate base growth, both separately for the regular distribution and regulate transmission, through 2023 broken down by each state. And you will see that in 2022 and 2023 there is no growth, but that growth does slow down a little bit. Praful Mehta : Okay, fair enough. I'll dig through that little bit more and discuss that. And then just finally on the equity needs point, I understand that clearly the pensioners helped, so that should help reduce the equity needs a little bit.  I wanted to understand in terms of balancing other goals right around leverage, holdco debt what are the key guide post that we should be thinking about as you think about the equity up to 600, what could have bring it down apart from pension, what could kindly to lead to pushing it up, just few of those guide posts would be helpful. Chuck Jones : Well, obviously 1 thing that could help bring it down is if we eventually see some reasonable low growth throughout our footprint. Just a little bit a low growth can have a huge impact. We give a range for a reason. I mean what \u2013 the performance of the pension plan can continue to affect what's needed there. You know it's \u2013 you know I wasn't trying to dodge Greg's question, I can't sit here today and tell you how much equity we're going to recommend we issue in 2022, \u201823, \u201824. It's not going to be more than $600 million, I can confidently say that. Praful Mehta : Got it. I really appreciate it guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning team. A - Chuck Jones : Good morning Julian. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey. So perhaps just to pick up on a slightly different state and angle, can you talk a little bit more about New Jersey and the energy masterplan here and specifically, how do you see opportunities emerging from that and/or some of your peers and their respective clean energy filings in parallel. I'm thinking you know AMI or otherwise. And then as well, can you touch on some of the commentary in the EMP with respect to reduction or a meaningful reduction in gas and obviously you guys aren\u2019t gas, but conversely how do you think about the electrification implications that seem to be pretty clear in the EMP as well. So perhaps touch holistically on the New Jersey business given everything going on if you don't mind. A - Chuck Jones : Okay, well, there\u2019s a lot in that question. I was just over in New Jersey last week. I met with three of the BPU commissioners. I met with the Governor and his policy team, the afternoon after he rolled out the energy masterplan, so I had a lot of opportunity to talk with him and his team in particular about how I think our company can help him be successful with it.  I think there are opportunities for us to help particularly in the electric vehicle area if the state decides to embrace utilities investing and you know building out a robust charging network throughout the state. You know, I think advanced metering is something the state has to decide what their policy is on, but we've got a lot of experience now in Pennsylvania with nearly 2 million meters there and we're going to be rolling out a 0.25 million in Ohio. So what I offered is, we'll come to the table and help them understand the pros and the cons, because there are both that we see, to help them make an informed decision on that.  I was very honest with him that I have no intention to get into investing in offshore wind. That's not something I see us taking on at this point in time. I talked with him about transmission and I know the BPU President made some comments about transmission, so I might as well just address those here, because I know I'm going to get a question.  You know his comments were specific to the network transmission service charges in the BGS auction for one company and that company was not us by the way. I saw what happened in the market with our stock yesterday after his comments became public.  I think the market should be smart enough to figure out that that involved one company. It should also be smart enough to figure out as he said at the end, that FERC sets transmission rates not the BPU, and they are not going to set different ones for New Jersey than they do everywhere else. It should also be smart to figure out that what we've told you all along is 90% of our transmission capital investment is in states other than New Jersey, and 90% of all of our $3 billion of investment is in states other than New Jersey.  But what I talked to the Governor and his team about is the fact that you know our transmission plan, if we work together can be complementary to what he's trying to do with his energy masterplan, and actually enabling of what he wants to do with his energy masterplan and they were very receptive to that, and we agreed to continue to work together to figure out how to make that happen.  So you know all-in-all, I think FirstEnergy is at the best place that it's ever been in New Jersey in terms of our relationships, in terms of the things that we're doing, in terms of you know us being trusted advisors to the Governor's office on his energy masterplan. There was nothing in that energy masterplan that scares me in any way, but there are pieces and parts that I think we can help more on and there's pieces and parts that we don't want to be part of. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : But just to clarify on that, could this be incremental capital? I know you guys talked about a very specific and committed equity capital plan and financing plan through the forecast period, but I just also hear your comments about you know helping the city of New Jersey here too. A - Chuck Jones : The reason we have a range in this CapEx plan that we've communicated is so that we have the ability to have flexibility to move it around state-to-state, transmission-to-distribution. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're going to add incremental capital beyond the range that we've given you, and the range that we're giving you is got a couple of control rods in it.  One is our customer's ability to pay and a constant awareness of the fact that without load growth these are going to be rate increases for customers and we have to be careful with that, and the other control rod being the balance sheet and managing the amount of equity that we are ultimately going to do to maintain our credit where we want it and get to that goal of begin BBB rated with all three agencies. So we're going to use this range that we have to satisfy what we're going to execute from a work plan in all five states. I'm not planning to change that range in the near term. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Alright, great. Well, best of luck. Thank you. A - Chuck Jones : Thanks Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Chuck, you only really owned kind of regulated generation in one state, West Virginia. Just curious how you're thinking about kind of the potential for kind of changes to the generation fleet, the composition of the generation fleet, maybe especially since the state kind of sitting on the Marcellus shale whether the economics makes sense for the company and the customer to add a little bit more gas fired generation into the regulated mix there. And then obviously, is there a need for kind of an uptick in either renewable or even kind of smart grid [ph] on the distribution side CapEx in West Virginia. A - Chuck Jones : In West Virginia the process is real simple. We're going to file an integrated resource plan in West Virginia by the end of this year. We'll share our ideas with West Virginia about where we see their capacity needs being, some thoughts on how to meet that, but those decisions are going to be made in conjunction with the state of West Virginia and you know I think that there are opportunities to embrace what's going on with the shale development and they are capitalizing on it with a lot of industrial growth in that state in terms of collection and compressing and so forth.  Whether they want to capitalize it in terms of generation sources, that remains to be seen and I don't want to speak for the state of West Virginia, but up until now at least, they haven't been real welcoming to renewables there, but you know from a FirstEnergy perspective, as we get separations from this whole FES issue and put that behind us, I think investment in renewable generation in a regulated context is something that we need to be thinking about adding to our portfolio, not deregulated in any fashion. We worked so hard to get to this company that I just said. It\u2019s a T&D company\u2019s low risk, no exposure to markets, that's where we want to stay. Any generation we might invest in is going to be earning a regulated rate of return just like those two plants in West Virginia do. Michael Lapides : Got it. One other question, totally unrelated. Just curious, can you \u2013 what's embedded in guidance in terms of kind of O&M growth rates across the distribution business and also at the corporate level? A - Chuck Jones : What\u2019s embedded in our guidance is keeping O&M flat over that period, and so what I've challenged the team to do is to get more efficient at how we deliver service to customers. We\u2019re in the process of rolling out an innovation center of FirstEnergy.  We've got a number of employees who have earned black belts in innovation engineering. We're going to put them all into one group. We're going to use that group to help drive innovation throughout this company as a way to make us more efficient and offset the annual \u2013 you know we give a 3 in it this year, a 3.5% wage increase on the average to our employees, you know about half of which ends up O&M. You know we've got to find a way to offset, but what's in the guidance period is flat O&M throughout that period. Michael Lapides : Got it. Starting off of 2019 base or starting off 2018 base, was there anything unusual in 2019? A - Chuck Jones : Starting off of the \u2013 when we finished FE tomorrow and finished dealing with our corporate costs, which by the way our T&D costs are bottom decile as far as O&M and our corporate costs are bottom quartile in terms of low being good in both cases. So we've got this company very lean and we expect to keep it that way throughout this period. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated. Chuck Jones : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman : Yeah Chuck, 90% of your transmission now, in that one slide you showed was formula based, forward looking. And what gets you to that last 10%? Is it a process similar to what we saw in New Jersey and what's the timing on that do you think? A - Chuck Jones : Well its \u2013 what\u2019s left, that is not forward looking formula rates is the former Allegheny system, and yes, the process would be to either eventually merge that into one of our existing Transcos or form another Transco, but the timing is what is such that we\u2019ll do that when it makes the best sense in terms of there will be a crossover point where the investment returns, you know more returns to shareholders in a forward looking formula rate than it does in a stated right. Right now the stated rate is better for all of you. Charles Fishman : Okay. And then second question, when we last talked in November, you hadn\u2019t finished the planning process and you wanted to hold off on guidance till \u201823. As you wrapped up that process, in your mind was there anything that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, surprise is probably a too strong of a word, but maybe was a little different than you thought as you wrapped up that process? A - Chuck Jones : No, not at all. I mean, I think it's very difficult to predict the future five years out, though a lot of what we had to get comfortable with in that planning process is what's the world going to look like, not today, but what's the world going to look like in 2023; you know what's going to happen with inflation, what's going to happen with growth, etcetera, etcetera and bracket those types of things.  One thing I can tell you I am confident in is that we're going to execute on the plan that we put out to this company and if it's $3.2 billion or $3.3 billion or $2.9 billion, it's going to deliver the results that we intend to deliver, and by getting to the point where more than 60% of all of it is in formula rates. It\u2019s very transparent and easy to calculate, and where we need to have rate cases, we're going to have them, just as I said.  We\u2019re going to file a rate case probably this month in New Jersey to get that trued up and recover some storm costs that you know we've deferred up until now, so our ability to execute on rate cases, we demonstrated we can do that too, but it was just really more getting comfortable with a range of outcomes that could happen between now and then, to get comfortable with the CAGR and get comfortable with the equity assumptions, both. Charles Fishman : Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you. A - Chuck Jones : And the only other thing I've added and I said this repeatedly at EEI, I'm not going to tell you something until I know. The engineer in me is still in there. We got to have the plan and we got to have the numbers work and I know we can execute on it, which is why I was probably a little slow in getting to a five year CAGR, but that's also what results in five straight years now, meeting or exceeding every single quarter that we've given you guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning everybody. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Andrew Weisel : My first one, I just want to follow up on the New Jersey questions earlier. I believe in the CapEx outlook, do those forecasts include some level of spending related to things that were covered by the energy masterplan like energy efficiency, EV\u2019s, AMI and will those buckets be part of the upcoming JCP&L rate case filing or would they come later in a separate compliance filings or something like that? Chuck Jones : No, they don't include anything for that. Right now it's about $175 million in transmission. You know what the IIP is. We're going to round out the first round of IIP and at some point in time hopefully you'll see IIP 2 just like you saw LTIIP II in Pennsylvania. And when that comes again, that's why we have a range of CapEx, so that we have the ability to have flexibility from state to state and T2D. Andrew Weisel : Okay. So that would be upside to the current numbers, if they were to be spending on that? Chuck Jones : Might be upside in New Jersey, but it would probably come away from somewhere else. I mean you can count on the capital plan being what I've told you it is, and we're going to get the CAGR that I've told you we're going to get, but the pieces and parts of it may move around from state to state. Andrew Weisel : Got it, that's helpful. And then last, this is just kind of a small one, but in Pennsylvania, congratulations on getting the LTIP 2 approved in full. My question is on the DSIC Rider, the benchmark ROE was just reduced by 10 basis points I believe yesterday to 9.45. Does that apply to your subsidiaries? And if so, can you give any sort of earnings sensitivity? I know this just came out yesterday, so it didn't give you a whole lot of time, but any thoughts on that? Chuck Jones : Eileen's on top of it. Eileen Mikkelsen : Good morning. It's Eileen Mikkelsen, I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Thank you, Chuck. Yes, we are aware that the PaPUC reduced the benchmark for the ROE in Pennsylvania yesterday to 9.45. Where that benchmark is used is really relates to our DSIC calculation and four utilities that have not had a base rate case in the last two years. They substitute that ROE benchmark number into their calculation when they calculate their DSIC revenues.  So for our four distribution utilities in Pennsylvania, going forward we\u2019ll use in our return calculations a return on equity of 9.45%, rather than the 9.55% that we've been using in the past, which really is the 10 basis points across those DSIC calculations, immaterial change to the revenues that we\u2019ll collect under those riders. The second thing that ROE benchmark is used for is really a customer protection to say to the extent that the utilities have earnings in excess of that benchmarks that they report in their quarterly earnings reports. If they exceed that benchmark, they will then have to turn off their DSIC recovery until such time as their earnings fall below that.  So we've looked at those numbers overnight. We're confident that it doesn't change our outlook for DISC collections during the planning horizon. I would put a caveat on it to say, we do have a settlement pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission to increase the cap we have in Penn Power. So assuming that's approved, we expect to be able to continue to collect DSIC across all of our utilities throughout the planning period. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great, that's very helpful. You mentioned Penn Power. Is there a potential for Penn Power rate case sometime soon? Eileen Mikkelsen : I don't think we're expecting a Penn Power rate case over the planning horizon and largely that's because we were able to reach a settlement with the other parties in Pennsylvania that's pending before the commission to allow us to collect DSIC revenue up to 7.5% of our base distribution rates in Penn Power, where for all the other utilities it's capped at 5%. So that really allowed us to cover that additional investment through the DSIC Rider and eliminated the need for a base rate case. Andrew Weisel : That's great. So Chuck, then is it fair to say that JCP&L might be the only rate case through 2023? Chuck Jones : I'd say that's a fair way to look at where we're at today, yeah. Eileen Mikkelsen : I would just \u2013 again, it's Eileen. I agree with Chuck. Put a caveat on it that we do have an obligation in 2023 to file an additional base rate case in the state of Maryland. Andrew Weisel : Right, good reminder. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning. Sophie Karp : I have a question on load growth. So you guys clearly mentioned that it's one of the factors that can help offset equity needs or impact you're planning in a way, and despite sort of a strong overall economy, it doesn't seem like we\u2019ve seen a lot of that in Ohio or elsewhere, may be in new territories. Could you discuss that a little bit and maybe give us some sense of what you have seen on the ground and what can change that to actually see some positive load growth? Thank you. Steve Strah : Sophie, this is Steve Strah. And we're conservative in terms of the load growth that we do put into our plan. And right now I believe we will see more of what we've seen in 2019 and that is basically flat load growth to slightly declining load growth. But I also \u2013 just looking at 2019 for a moment, you know we were down 1.1% and that was slightly lower than our guidance, which was 0.6%.  So when we estimate it, we're pretty good at estimating where we're going to land, we didn't miss it significantly. And in terms of sensitivities, the 1% decline that we saw in 2019 versus the guidance really impacts earnings only about 2%, and that's really driven by the residential sector.  Our commercial and industrial loads are really \u2013 and rates are fixed or having demand rates, which are not as impactful. So right now we do see the manufacturing recession continuing on in 2020 before we start to see recovery. We're hopeful to start to see that recovery in mid-year or a little bit later. So right now I would just say look forward to flat load growth within our territory. We don't really see that changing significantly. Chuck Jones : So, the only thing that I would add that I think in the back half of this planning period that we're talking about that could be significant is this shell cracker plant in Western Pennsylvania, and empirically as economists look at the world, it's difficult to factor that in. But I just drove over there for a meeting last week. It's due to come online by end of 2021, so it's a year and a half away.  It won't be a lot of load itself, because they are going to self-generate with the methane, that's a waste product of the cracking process, but the industrial load that's going to pop-up, and is already popping up, you're starting to see cranes in the air on other sites, I think can have an opportunity to jump-start this economy in Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia, and we are now starting to see construction progress on the cracker plant in Ohio too.  So the combination of both of those I think can be something that could be a good surprise and it's difficult to factor into the numbers. Steve Strah : I would also add Sophie lastly, you know we are encouraged by seeing the two consecutive years of residential load growth. Albeit modest, we look at that as being very positive for some of the reasons I mentioned earlier. So I don't want to be too much of a downer at all. Sophie Karp : Thank you. Chuck Jones : And look, I mean you're in northeastern Ohio. I mean we've got forward investing of over $1 billion in two plants in northeastern Ohio. GM had just announced the state-of-the-art battery manufacturing facility in Ohio. The former Lordstown plant is being repurposed into an electric vehicle, light-duty, medium-duty truck facility. So when those things all get done, the job market and the economy is going to benefit from all of that. So in the back end of this planning period, I'm optimistic that we can see some growth. Sophie Karp : Got it, thank you. Chuck Jones : Okay, I see no other questions in the queue. So thank you again for your support, really over the last five years since I've been in this job, and you know I think we intend to have another year in 2020 just like we've had in the last five years. Expect to be a fully regulated company here by the end of this month with FES behind us and then just move on from there. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day!",

Now, I will the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thank you, Irene, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. These are unprecedented times. We hope all of you are listening this morning are safe and healthy. We realize you have numerous questions on how this public health emergency affects FirstEnergy. Our goal today is obviously to review our first quarter earnings, which once again are solid, but also to talk about the journey we've been on during the COVID-19 pandemic and the path that we see ahead. I'll cover the broader story of our business and why we believe our strategy is built for resiliency during this crisis. I'll also review the actions we are currently taking to navigate in today's environment. Overall, I'm confident we're well positioned to manage through these events. First, the diversity and scale of our transmission and distribution operations across 65,000 square miles in five states is a fundamental strength for FirstEnergy. We operate critical infrastructure, and that means everything our employees do is considered essential work. But as we continue this important work to maintain our large electric system and provide the energy our customers and communities need my number one priority is to help keep our employees, their families and our customers safe. Minimize the risks, we have taken significant steps to quickly adapt to the new circumstances and protect the health of our employees and customers. We successfully transitioned more than 7000 employees to work remotely. That's more than half of our workforce and it includes moving our call center employees to a work at home environment as well. For our workforce unable to work remotely, we've implemented preventative measures to help keep them safe on the job. We've secured protective equipment like surgical masks, and other supplies like thermometer, they're being used by our operated companies, regulated generation plants and other work groups. We have also increased cleaning and disinfecting measures, relocated job briefs and reporting locations to sites conducive to social distancing and adjusted work schedules. We have positioned crews so they are working with the same small group of people each day on what we call pods. They're consistently using the same vehicle and the same equipment to limit exposure. And we are managing our work to minimize potential exposure with the public. We continue adjusting our work plans and remain flexible to meet the ongoing needs of our workers, minimize the spread of this virus and adopt the current guidance from state and federal health agencies. It takes consistent communication on everyone's part, focusing on the health and safety of our employees and customers throughout the process. This pandemic has become a defining moment for our country and our company. What encourages me is knowing that we will emerge from this stronger because we've come together to learn how to work smarter, more creatively and more efficiently. In fact, we're all very well positioned to manage the impact of the economic slowdown. And we believe our distribution and transmission investments will continue to provide stable and predictable earnings. As the situation continues to develop, the diversity and scale of our operations gives us the flexibility to shift our investments if needed and continue deploying capital throughout the system. While we're keeping a close eye on our supply chain, we do not anticipate significant disruptions. Since the middle of March, we have been looking at the early impact the pandemic is having on usage trends, both from a system wide load perspective and from a sampling of Pennsylvania smart meter data. We have seen system wide weather adjusted load dropped by almost 6% from mid-March until mid-April, compared to the same timeframe last year. We've also seen increases of more than 6% for Pennsylvania residential customers driven by the stay at home order. We would expect similar increases in residential usage across the rest of our service territory since all of our states are operating under stay at home orders. While our commercial and industrial customer load is down almost 13% compared to our four year average, from 2016 to 2019, I would remind you that prior to the pandemic we were already seeing reduced industrial sales due to the manufacturing recession. However, our rate structures provide a measure of stability even in tumultuous times. About two thirds of our base distribution revenues come from residential sales, while 28% are from commercial customers and about 7% come from the industrial sector. And about 20% of our total load is on the decoupled rate structure in Ohio. In addition, a significant portion of our base distribution revenue isn't directly tied to energy consumption, but is derived from other billing determinants. In fact, about 80% of commercial rates and 90% of industrial are made up of customer and demand charges. We are pleased that in Maryland, the Public Service Commission proactively issued an order this month authorizing deferral for future recovery of all prudent incremental COVID-19 related cost. The strong regulatory policy demonstrates firm support for our customers and our business. I would like to personally thank Chairman Stanek and the rest of the commissioners in Maryland for their leadership on this important regulatory issue. We can also recover incremental uncollectible expenses through existing riders in Ohio and New Jersey. Our current regulatory calendar is light through our 2023 planning period. Active items include the distribution base rate case we filed in New Jersey in February, seeking to recover increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our customers. Along with recovery of storm costs incurred over the last few years, we expect an ALJ will be assigned to our case soon followed by the issuance of a procedural schedule. In the meantime, the discovery phase of the case has begun for parties to review the date details of our request. We anticipate the litigation schedule to provide the opportunity to discuss favorable settlement with the parties in the case. We also reached an agreement to transfer JCP&L's portion of the Yard's Creek plant to LS Power and we expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2021 pending approvals. In West Virginia, we have a requirement to make an informational filing by December 30 2020 for our Integrated Resource Plan. The IRP updates our plan to provide our West Virginia customers with adequate and reliable generation resources that are reasonably balanced cost and risk. And finally, we have a commitment to file a rate case for our smallest utility Potomac Edison in Maryland by early 2023. Moving now to our first quarter results, which marked another quarter of solid execution as a fully regulated company. Yesterday after market closed, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share, along with operating earnings of $0.66 per share, which is a $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our results were driven by higher transmission margin and lower expenses which helped to offset the impact of mild weather on our distribution revenues. As always, Steve will discuss the drivers in more detail later in the call. We're affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share. We are also affirming our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021 and 5% to 7% extending through 2023 as well as our plan to issue up to a total of $600 million in equity in 2020 to 2023. In addition, we're introducing earnings guidance at $0.48 to $0.58 per share for the second quarter of 2020. While the financial markets have been extremely volatile and sometimes illiquid these past couple of months FirstEnergy continues to be a low risk stable, predictable utility. We have adequate liquidity of $3.5 billion, strong and proven access to the capital markets and a pension plan that's outperformed in these volatile market conditions due to its low risk conservative asset allocation. Steve will also cover these three probably in greater detail. Finally, let me take a moment to discuss our succession planning. I've been getting a lot of questions on this. Just because I look old doesn't mean I feel old. Well, I don't plan on going anywhere yet. I know many of you have been wondering about our plans for a transition. I can tell you that our Board has been just as thorough and thoughtful on this topic as they are with any other key governance issue. We started planning for my replacements literally right after I became CEO. What started as our typical emergency planning has evolved into robust succession planning discussions. In 2018, we made several moves that were designed to broaden the experience of some of our key executives. This included placing Steve into the CFO role, bringing Sam Belcher over from FENOC to become President of the Utilities and moving John Taylor out of the Finance organization into a leadership role and distribution operations. The Board and I are continuing discussions and I would expect you may see additional organizational moves within our leadership team in the coming months. They're part of what I said will be a thoughtful transition and leadership at FirstEnergy. But having said that, I have made no decision about my own retirement and as long as the good load and my Board are willing, it won't be anytime this year. Thank you for your time. Stay well and we look forward to seeing many of you once again when things return to normal. Now Steve will review the first quarter. Steve Strah : Good morning. It's great to speak with you today. As always, you'll find all reconciliations along with other detailed information about the quarter in our strategic and financial highlights document that's posted on our Web site. Now let's review our results. We reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share. Our GAAP results included $318 million non-cash after tax pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment that we were required to recognize when FirstEnergy Solutions emerge from bankruptcy at the end of February as an unaffiliated independent company, now called Energy Harbor. This adjustment was considered was consistent with the range we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. I will revisit the status of our pension funding and liquidity position later in my comments. Adjusting for this charge as well as other special items, first quarter operating earnings were $0.66 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. In the distribution business, earnings decrease compared to the first quarter of 2019. Lower revenues were driven by the impact of mild weather on customer usage. This was mostly offset by Ohio decoupling revenues, as well as incremental rider revenue in both Ohio and Pennsylvania. First quarter 2020 distribution earnings also decreased due to the absence of Ohio DMR revenue, higher depreciation expense and net financing costs, which offset lower expenses. Customer usage decreased compared to the first quarter of 2019 on an actual and weather adjusted basis, heating degree days were approximately 18% below normal in the first quarter of 2019. This drove a decrease in actual residential sales of 12.6% compared to the first quarter of 2019. On a weather adjusted basis, residential sales decreased by 1.3%, compared to the same period last year. We continue to see modest growth in customer count. In the commercial customer class, first quarter sales decreased 7.5% on an actual basis and 1.6% when adjusted for whether compared to the first quarter of 2019. And finally, in our industrial class, first quarter load decreased 3% compared to the same period last year. Consistent with our fourth quarter, we only saw growth in the shale gas sector, with declines in other major sectors in our footprint. Looking at first quarter results in the transmission business, our earnings increased primarily due to higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continuing investments in energizing the future program. And in our customer segment, first quarter results primarily reflect lower operating expenses. Last quarter, we discussed our pension performance for 2019 and its impact on future funding requirements. I'd like to update that today in light of market volatility in our pension remark from February 26 of this year. As we told you on the fourth quarter, the funded status of our plan was 79% at year end, the strong performance of our plan investments in 2019 resulted in a significant reduction in our plan funding requirements in 2022 and 2023 of about $300 million. At our February remeasurement, our funded status was 77% and our funding requirements decreased again slightly. From $159 million down to $140 million for 2022 and from $375 million down to $360 million for 2023. Our conservative asset allocation has served us well so far in 2020. Back in mid 2019, we made the decision to move nearly $1 billion of plant assets out of public equities into cash. At the end of 2019, we held only about 25% of total assets in equities. We also have a good story when we're looking at pension as of the end of the first quarter, while the S&P was down 20%, our assets declined only 4.4% as of March 31. After our fourth quarter call, but prior to market volatility related to the virus, we successfully completed refinancing of $1.75 billion in FE Corp debt at a blended rate of 2.9%. That transaction was executed at the best rates ever seen in the utility space. In March, we completed a $250 million debt financing at MAIT, and in April, we completed a $250 million debt financing at Penelec. Finally, in February, we used the proceeds from our senior note issuance, together with cash on hand to fund the final settlement payment of $853 million to Energy Harbor upon their emergence. The remaining proceeds from the $1.75 billion corp debt issuance were used to refinance $1 billion in bank term loans. Our maturities are manageable and our liquidity position is strong. We have remaining debt maturities of only $800 million this year, including $50 million at Toledo Edison, and a $500 million term loan at FE Corp, which we plan to refinance this summer. We project liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion over the next 12 months and our liquidity facilities are committed until the year end 2022. We do not issue commercial paper. So we've avoided liquidity issues experienced by many others in the industry over the past two months. Before I turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to reiterate FirstEnergy's overall value proposition, which is very simple, but also very unique, especially in periods of extreme volatility and uncertainly, like we're facing today. FirstEnergy is a low risk fully regulated, stable and predictable wires utility that spans five states, including providing scale and diversity. Our 6 million utility customers provide revenue stability. Two-thirds of our distribution revenues stem from our residential customers, which are higher margin, while only one-third is generated from our C&I customers, which are lower margin. When combined with Ohio decoupling, this mix partially insulates FirstEnergy from recessions. We have very good regulatory relationships in our jurisdictions. And our current regulatory calendar is light through our 2023 planning period, resulting in low regulatory risk across our footprint. We invest $3 billion annually across our service area and we have a long pipeline of regulated capital expenditures. More than 60% of our investments are under formula rates and riders that minimize regulatory lag and provide timely return on and returns of those investments. One-third of our earnings come from FirstEnergy transmission, which is not influenced by near-term changes in customer load and is primarily supported by capital programs mandated by PJM or required by FirstEnergy to maintain safe, reliable transmission service across our very large footprint. We are an investment grade company targeting BBB credit ratings from all three rating agencies. Our liquidity is adequate at $3.5 billion. Our access to the capital markets is season, proven and remains very strong. In combination, all of these attributes support an attractive CAGR as well as a sustainable dividend that management aspires to grow, both of which are strongly desired by true utility investors. And finally, our management team has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding its commitments. Thank you. And now let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning team. Thank you all and hope you all are well. I wanted to follow up just to come back to where you started the conversation actually. Can you talk about more on the operational side, how employees are handling the situation and how you think about the return to work, especially across the very different states that you operate in? And then perhaps in tandem with that, if I can throw in there, how do you think about executing against your capital spend plans just given having your employees dispersed et cetera as it stands today and under what scenarios you might reevaluate your CapEx too, but first on the operational and second on the CapEx? Chuck Jones : All right. So first, Julien, operationally, I think it's important to point out and FirstEnergy is not unique here. Our industry has prepared for business continuity, every company and part of that has been for the last couple of decades, at least a pandemic Emergency Response Plan. We dusted it off a few times over the years with MERS and SARS and H1N1 and Ebola. This time, obviously, we put it into full implementation. The time to prepare for something like this isn't when it's happened. But it's in advance when life is normal. And we put a lot of thought into how we were going to go about this. And I just tell you, I'm very proud of our entire leadership team and literally down to every single employee. They've all stepped up, they've showed creativity, ingenuity. And I think, our operations are continuing almost as if normal, even with 7000 people working remotely, our field forces have maintained a positive attitude. We very quickly negotiated memorandums of understandings with all of our unions across the five states on how we were going to operate. They have the PPE. They have the ability to work in pods, as I said in my call, and that's three or four employees reporting to one location as opposed to having several dozen coming into a service center and delivering materials remotely. I think the proof is that it's working as we've had nine cases at FirstEnergy for a 13,000 employee workforce. One of those cases in New Jersey, unfortunately resulted in a death. But we've had zero cases where the disease has been transferred at work. And I think that shows that the things that we're doing are working. I think we can stay in this mode for a while. And I think that gives us the flexibility to be very thoughtful and deliberate on how and when we want to return to normal operations. I honestly don't think the world is going to get back to normal until there's widespread distribution of a vaccine for this virus. So, we're evaluating what the new normal is going to mean in the interim. But, to your specific question on CapEx, a big piece of our guidance in our CAGR is driven by those investments. And as I said, we don't see any supply chain interruptions that we're worried about right now. And that includes the workforce supply chain, because most of the significant capital investment that we're making is being done with a contracted workforce that we lined up many, many years ago. We lined up really before we started energizing the future seven years ago. So right now, I mean, I don't see anything that I'm worried about taking this off track. And that's why we're comfortable with being able to not only reaffirm our guidance for this year, but reaffirm our CAGR. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : So just in New Jersey, there's a lot going on with the BP workload. And I know we're still kind of waiting for the procedural schedule. But any sort of sense on whether we could see a settlement struck this year from a timing perspective, as we think about COVID related challenges, and any sense on the timing of the next IIP. Chuck Jones : Well, first on the rate case, it got delayed, I think a little bit as everybody was responding and reacting to this pandemic. But I think they'll get the schedule back on track here soon. Assign it to an ALJ, get a procedural schedule. We weren't anticipating really anything to happen with a final outcome on that case this year anyway. I think there will be opportunities along the way to have settlement discussions, if that would happen, it'll be late this year at the earliest I would think. So I don't -- I just don't expect much impact of that rate case in 2020. And there's none of that in our guidance anyway. As far as the IIP, the current IIP runs through the end of this year. And I think right now, I'm not sure that we're even going to file for an additional IIP. We're still evaluating it. But right now, we don't have any plans to do that. We've got the investments that we're making in capital going on in transmission and other states in our operating area. And I think we're going to be fine with the service to our customers in New Jersey after this first round. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then in Pennsylvania, it's been quiet. Does your sort of experience in Ohio and kind of the latest macro uncertainty maybe strengthen the case for seeking decoupling which has been available. I mean, some of these usage trends may structurally change over the long term as you kind of obviously highlighted as a new normal or is kind of this DSIC adequate for you until you kind of file the next GRC? Chuck Jones : We don't have any plans for a broad rate case activity in Pennsylvania for the next several years. And I think that LTIP and the DSIC mechanism are working fine. And they're generating the type of investment that's needed for customers and they're generating reliable returns for shareholders without lag. So I think the way things work in Pennsylvania are working fine and I don't see any reason to change it. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Thanks a lot guys. That was it this morning. And Chuck by the way, that's for the record, you do look very young, not old. Thanks, guys. Chuck Jones : Thanks Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrd : Most of the key questions have been addressed. I did have one broader question. Just as we think about going into 2021. If we do have an extended economic downturn, so recovery is slow. How do you think about just your CapEx plans, ability for customers to handle the impact of the CapEx? Is that viewed as just, this is critical work that needs to be done? Or is there any just consideration of customer ability to pay if we do have a very extended pretty severe economic downturn? How do you just think about that longer term? Chuck Jones : Well, we haven't exactly seen a lot of load growth across our footprint over the last half a dozen years or so really since the last big recession. And so, the impact on customers is always something that we're very thoughtful about as we make these investments. But I do believe these investments are investments that are needed. The transmission and distribution infrastructure we have at FirstEnergy is old. It's in some cases in need of repair and modernization. I think that the automation that we're adding in some areas, we're making these changes to serve customers better. And I think we're doing it in a way by moving it around from state to state and so forth, that that we are constantly watching out for the impact on customers and keeping our bills very moderate and keeping our rates amongst the lowest in pretty much every jurisdiction that we work in. So I think we keep an eye on that all the time. And I don't see anything happening here that's going to cause us to have to significantly adjust our plans. Stephen Byrd : Well, that's a thoughtful answer that makes sense. Maybe just one last one. I think you gave a very thorough response on just COVID-19 impacts. If we zeroed in on the supply chain, if we do have an extended shelter in place dynamic, are there certain elements of the supply chain that you focus on more as being sort of more at risk if conditions deteriorate, or overall? Do you feel fairly good about the supply chain dynamic? Chuck Jones : As of right now, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're not seeing anything that concerns us. We made a decision at FirstEnergy a number of years ago, four, four and a half years ago to implement a Buy America strategy. So we don't rely a whole lot on foreign supplies. We're 80% plus buy in from American made -- buy America made products from American companies. And I do think that well, in the short-term -- I think in the short-term, the risk was bigger there. I think you're going to see the states have to reopen. And I do think from our experience, there are ways to bring people back to work and give them the PP and take their temperatures. And introduce at some point, antibody testing and take steps to get people to work and still maintain a healthy workforce and not have this virus spread. So, I think you can accomplish both. Right now, I'm not concerned, I think that our supply chain is going to be fine. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : So just a question on the -- maybe just a little bit of baselining on what you're assuming for sales and in terms of like the length of the downturn here? Is there, I know your sensitivity is relatively low compared to a lot of other utilities. But just be good to have a rough idea of what kind of economic or base assumption you're using for the downturn from the virus and the like in your planning? And how much have you sensitized that? Chuck Jones : So let me let me start with an answer here. And then maybe I'll ask Eileen to step in and provide some additional color. But, my view Steve is, it's a jigsaw puzzle that we're still trying to piece all the parts together on. We talked about the impact of the stay at home orders driving residential usage up 6% to 6.5%. And the fact that 65% of our distribution revenues come from this segment, the reduction in load on the commercial and industrial is about 13%. And, but as I said 80% to 90% of that is collected through customer charges and demand charges, and then you layer on top of that, the decoupling in Ohio, which represents about 20% of our load. When you put that all together, I'm confident that that there's not going to be any material swing in weather adjusted revenues that are going to take us off track from delivering on our guidance, because, or I wouldn't have reaffirmed guidance. So, in the end, we don't have a final number that I can give you yet. But I can tell you this, we just added one quarter on top of five years now of meeting or exceeding every midpoint that we've given you. And I don't plan to break that record. So, I do think there will be continued lingering effect with the C&I even after the stay at home orders begin to be reduced. But also, as I said, with our company, I don't expect 7000 people to come back to work all at once. So I think some of the positive impacts in the residential segment are going to continue for a while to maybe not at 6% to 6.5%. But, at some level, above normal. So Eileen, you have anything you want to add? Eileen Mikkelsen : Thanks, Chuck. I think you really nailed it. We continue to look at this very carefully. The only thing I would add is that in addition to our own models, we're looking very carefully at economic indicators from Moody's and others to inform our view of the forecast going forward. And other than that Chuck spot on what you had to say. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So my read of that is that the way your revenues work and that the part that's locked up and not volume sensitive plus the way, you've got things locked up with C&I more on a demand charge, kind of not that you're fully protected, but it gives you just a decent amount of protection to deal with this, even if it extends longer than people generally think. Chuck Jones : Yes. And I'll add, Steve said that a third of it comes from transmission, which isn't load dependent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman : I'd like a follow-up on that last question. On Slide 4, where you show like 80% to 90% of C&I is fixed rates? How does a good portion of that fixed rate is a demand charge? How typically does that reset realizing your -- you got numerous jurisdiction. But does that demand charge reset on an annual basis typically, so even though it doesn't impact you this year, if a commercial or industrial customer cuts back on load, would that impact you next year on that fixed component? Chuck Jones : For the fixed component is basically something that resets every month. So and their monthly bill is based on what the peak demand they hit in that month is. And so it's not directly tied to the throughput that that we're talking about when we say usage is off by 13%. It's the first the fixed customer charge and then the demand charge. So, now if you've got a factory that was working three shifts and it's now down to work in one shift, the demand charge from that one shift is essentially going to set the bill. So, and we don't know -- we don't reset rates every year. So our rates are in place until we have a -- until we have a rate case. Then, the demand charges are what the demand charges are, and they're based on the demand the customer hits every month. So, Eileen, anything you want to add there? Eileen Mikkelsen : No, Chuck. Thank you. Charles Fishman : Chuck, wait, maybe try to put it in a more simpler fashion for me. Let's say you have a factory that's got three lines of production. And because of a continued downturn, they said that we're only going to use two lines of production. Well, obviously that cuts down on the demand. Then, what you're saying here is that fixed component does go lower after a while correct? Chuck Jones : It can go lower in that scenario, it would likely go lower for that customer. Charles Fishman : And then at that point, you'd have to wait for a rate case to reset rates and recover that correct? Eileen Mikkelsen : Chuck, if I could jump in here. When I'm sensing up, pardon me, when I think about those demand rates in the scenario you just indicated, we have billing demands that are set on a monthly basis, what's the peak demand you hit on a monthly basis. So if a customer's running three separate shifts, and they go to one shift, their peak demand isn't necessarily as Chuck said earlier going to change as a result of that elimination of those two extra shifts because it's not an aggregate demand over the course of the day rather, it's the peak demand during that day, so we would expect that to be, the billing demand to remain in place based on that one shift example you just used. Charles Fishman : Well, but I guess what I'm saying is, what if a customer makes a conscientious decision to lower its demand by reducing the size of its production? So, irrespective of number of shifts? Chuck Jones : In that case there will be a reduction in that customer's bill, but paying out when you think about across the entire segment, not all customers are going to have the ability to do that. And, all we're trying to tell you is, our experiences during past recessions, that even know throughput might be off by 13% revenue isn't off by that same amount because of these fixed charges and demand charges that occur in their bills. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Thank you for taking my question and appreciate you taking all the time on today's earnings call. Actually, I have a question about customer counts, not necessarily demand, but just the number of customers you serve. Can you talk about trends you have seen both on the residential side and on the industrial side, just in terms of the number of customers served over the last couple of years? Can you talk about what happens coming out of 2008, 2009 to your customer counts across the residential and industrial level? Chuck Jones : Well, the 2008, 2009 numbers are not in my brain anymore maybe they're in Eileen's or someone else's. But obviously, we lost a lot of customers. I know the numbers that stick in my brain, we lost 25% of our industrial load in one year from part of '08 to end of '09. And I think, I remember in Ohio I think it was 50,000 meters that we lost in Ohio alone. So we are seeing growth in meters every year. Maybe Eileen can fill in some of those numbers. But the growth in meters is pretty much also being offset by the fact that energy efficiency is working against that growth, which is what results in pretty much flat to no low growth across our footprint. Eileen, you have any thing on the numbers? Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes. Thanks, Chuck. I would just say our residential customer counts have grown quarter-over-quarter. In quarter one in 2020 versus quarter one in 2019, just about a 0.5% in customer growth counts. So we've seen that quarter, that trend continuing each and every quarter for a number of prior quarters. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you and just real quick. That's an easy one. Can you remind us what is the load growth assumption in your 6% to 8%, in your 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rates? Chuck Jones : Steve, do you want to take that one? Steve Strah : Yes. Michael, we're assuming basically load to be flat over our planning horizon. So when you look at the trailing 12 months, we see that we're slightly below that right now. But that's what we have baked into both these 6% to 8% and the 5% to 7%. Michael Lapides : Got it. And you are still assuming in the 6% to 8% that it'll still be flat. Steve Strah : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : I'm just thrilled, I guess, just sort of tie things up here with all these questions on the economy. If we have a deep recession, are you guys saying that you guys are relatively economically or you guys are relatively insulated or immune, I guess to a big slowdown, because the one thing that comes to mind here is that, we're potentially at least in this region, looking at businesses maybe never reopening. It's not out of the question here. I mean, retail establishments, just in general. I'm just trying to make sure that I get completely clear. Are you guys saying that basically, if we have a big deep, long-term recession, you don't see any regulatory changes or anything that could impact you guys? Chuck Jones : I think what we're trying to say right now is that the diversity of our footprint, the diversity of our revenue streams with a third being transmission that's not load dependent. And 65% of the distribution revenue being residential and that piece at least as long as the stay at home or there in fact is growing that we see nothing that significantly give you a range of earnings of $0.20 that's going to take us outside of that range. So we were comfortable reaffirming our guidance. And as I said, I mean we're a big company and we have over $2 billion of O&M related expenses in our company and if we need to get a little more diligent at O&M discipline to offset some of what might be happening on the meter side of things, we'll do that. We've got a lot of moving parts as being a regulated utility that we can -- we can work to deliver on our commitments. So I think the way to take that is, yes, I'm certain that there are going to be in particular small businesses that don't reopen after this pandemic. They just don't have the working capital and the liquidity to survive something like this with no revenues coming in. But, I do think in time, somebody will replace them, because the services they were providing are needed by society. So I think, it's going to be deeper than what maybe a lot of people think and maybe more U-shaped than what some people think. But I think we're built to be able to handle it is the way I would say at FirstEnergy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : I want to just to follow up on the recovery mechanisms that you have. So outside of Maryland, which has established that COVID, specific guest rider, which riders or trackers, I utilize now that your jurisdictions to track the COVID related costs and how easy is it I guess, to separate what's COVID and what's not COVID at this point? Thank you. Chuck Jones : Well, so the biggest piece that I think a lot of people have been worried about is ultimate uncollectible expense. And in our case, we have recovery mechanisms in place in Ohio and New Jersey already as part of our normal operations to recover those. I think we're having conversations with other regulators. And I think with [indiscernible] guidance, I think you're going to see regulators across the country realize that there's going -- these are unique times and there's going to be a unique approach. And as I said, for the Maryland Public Service Commission, be the first ones to step out and take the lead on that. They should be very proud of their leadership. But, the costs so far aren't anything that have concerned me and right now, I'd say we're just treating it as another operating challenge that we need to overcome and still deliver on our commitments and over time, if they grow, we're going to be working with our regulators and we're going to be watching what others do. We're not normalizing any of these costs. Because, like I said, I'm treating it as a normal operating challenge today. But in the end if our whole industry starts to normalize COVID costs out, then I'm not going to put FirstEnergy at a disadvantage by not doing that. But right now, if these costs are not -- they're not anything I'm overly concerned about. We didn't have anything in the first quarter that we felt any need to have any special treatment for. And we're having discussions with our regulators in West Virginia and Pennsylvania to kind of fill the gaps similar to what Maryland has done. Sophie Karp : Thank you. And then real quick on the CapEx. Are there any particular types of project or any particular type of work maybe that cannot be done efficiently with social distancing that you may be looking to defer and maybe bring forward something else? Have you looked at that yet? Chuck Jones : No. I don't there's anything that we see that's problematic. If you think about our CapEx plan then I've shared these numbers in the past. We spend $3 billion in average $1 million to $1.5 million increments. So they're smaller projects for the most part. But our crews have been very creative and figuring out how to work safely. And they're doing a fantastic job. We had two pretty significant storms come through with over a half a million customer outages. And they restored service as fast as if not faster as we would do under normal operations. They are rising to the occasion and saying, \"Look, we're essential workers and we're going to prove that we're essential,\" and they know the challenge of keeping the lights on to 6 million families and businesses is very important right now. So I don't see anything there that we are worried about either. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to pick up on the kind of bad debt expense question. And I was wondering if you could provide some detail with regards to what that looked like in 08', '09. How that, we're very early in here. But how that now compares to then. And when you have -- you talked about recovery mechanisms in Ohio, New Jersey, is that everything or just any more color there would be very helpful? Chuck Jones : Well, the first thing that I would say, and I've been in this business for 40 years, I don't think it's fair to assume that every customer who can't pay their bill today is going to end up being a bad debt. My experience is customers want to pay their bills; they don't want a black mark on their credit history. And as long as we're flexible and work with them the right way, we can generally get to where we don't end up writing off a lot of what's going to get backed up here today. And we are getting -- we're worth thinking through how to be even more creative and more flexible and particularly working with our C&I customers, where in the past, we did not have payment arrangements for C&I customers. And we're looking at how we do that going forward again to help them ease back into business and get back up to more of a normal operations without having this bill be something they have to have to settle up day one. So in Ohio, and New Jersey, as I said it only becomes an uncollectible expense when we write it off. And we have the ability then to recover that from -- other customers to our existing rates, a little bit of a lag in New Jersey. We now have that ability under what Maryland did. And I think all of the companies in Pennsylvania will get together and have discussions with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, still early on in this process. So while Maryland acted quick. The other regulators are looking at all of these COVID related costs too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Durgesh Chopra : Am I sorry if I missed this, but I just wanted to ask you about your credit metrics and given the -- sort of you've talked about the decoupling the transmission rate base. What do you think, how are you positioned versus your target credit metrics this year and maybe 2021. And then second part, maybe any color that you can sort of provide us with in terms of your conversations with credit rating agencies. Thank you. Chuck Jones : Yes. So I would just start by saying, again, I don't think there's anything significant to report. We still plan on no new equity until 2022. And then up to 600 million a year in 2022 and 2023. The metrics this year are turning out, this is the transition year with the delay in the Energy Harbor emergence from 2019 to this year. So the rating agencies are all looking beyond this year anyway. But excluding you Energy Harbor, we're in good shapes with all the current thresholds. We're at BBB with Fitch today. S&P revised our upgrade threshold to 12 from 13. And I think we will eventually support a positive outlook for us. We're having discussions with Moody's, about the upgrade threshold. And I think that's the important thing. As our current conversations with the rating agencies are focused on the top-end and what is needed for upgrades rather than where we've been in the past, which is worrying about the bottom end. And I think one of the key drivers for the discussions that we're having is, is our low risk profile that the agencies are now starting to see. The impact of the pandemic is a perfect example of our change in risk profile. We're dealing with it. We have no material change in our earnings, no material change in our pension funding status, no material change in our credit metrics. And we're able to do that because of the diversity of our footprint, the stable and constructive regulatory environments, 55% of our revenue coming from residential customers. And I would just tell you there's -- we have a very, very small generation footprint. Other large T&D companies like ours with 6 million or, multi-million customers have large generation businesses, even if regulated they support that. We only have a couple power plants left and so we don't have the risk of the generation side of this business either. And there are only one or two other companies in our space, I think with the low risk profile, that we enjoy at FirstEnergy. And I think that's what's forming the foundation of our discussions. We're focused on ultimately get into BBB with all three rating agencies and then a plan to stay there long term. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Thanks for squeezing me in here. Appreciate all the details on mechanisms and downside protections. One thing I just wanted to ask about was, what's the latest thinking on smart meters in New Jersey following the end of the moratorium? Chuck Jones : Well, I think that we'll engage in the conversations with the administration and the BPU in New Jersey. And we've got a lot of experience now with almost 2 million of them in Pennsylvania that we've already installed. We're beginning the process with grid mod in Ohio, where we will install around 700,000 in Ohio. I think that puts us in a position to really share in New Jersey what some of the benefits and some of the risks are. And we'll engage in the discussion and ultimately, that's where the policymakers in New Jersey want to go. Then we'll install a million smart meters in New Jersey just like we have in others states. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Have you noticed any change in interest to your appetite from regulators or politicians during this stay at home period? Chuck Jones : I think under -- the governor introduced his new energy master plan, just shortly before this pandemic hit. And I think that right now, everybody in the state government, including the BPU are focused on how to best get through this pandemic right now. So I think it's -- those discussions have been put off and they'll get picked back up, once New Jersey gets back into a kind of safe and healthy more normal operations. Andrew Weisel : Got it. Okay. Then one last one, if I may, I might be looking for something where there's nothing, but the new slide deck described the dividend as sustainable. And you mentioned that management aspires to grow it. Is that sort of a potential softening of the dividend policy? Or can you share your latest views on the dividend growth outlook and if that's changed at all over the past few months? Chuck Jones : I think you're reading into something that's not there. Our dividend policy is what it is. And we're kind of at the high-end of that range right now. So, I think that's more what it's signaling is that, we are in the high-end of the range that we committed to and so I don't know that you can expect one every single year but that's not my decision, that's our Board's, and we expect to honor the dividend policy that we've communicated. Andrew Weisel : Sure. Okay, good. I just wanted to be sure there was no change in thinking. Thank you so much and stay safe and healthy. Chuck Jones : All right, well, thanks to all of you. The good call, it's good to have a call where we're talking about regulated operations. I can't say running a regulated utility is boring right now with this pandemic, but I'm proud of our team, as I've said repeatedly, and we're going to get it -- get through this just fine. We're going to deliver on our commitments; we're going to keep our employees safe and healthy. We hope all of you can stay safe and healthy too. And look forward to seeing you in person when that makes sense again. Thank you. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings! And welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp, Second Quarter 2020 Earning Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thanks Dana. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website, along with the presentation which supports today's discussion. Participants in today\u2019s call include our Chief Executive Officer, Chuck Jones; President, Steve Strah; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Taylor. We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session. Now, I\u2019ll note turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Jones : Thank you, Irene, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. As Irene indicated, we have a new lineup of speakers today, reflecting the management changes that were put in place in May. Steve Strah, in his new role as President of FirstEnergy will discuss the operational and regulatory updates on today's call, and John Taylor returning to the financial realm in his new role as CFO will review our results. As we've discussed, these changes are the result of extensive succession planning with our board and a thoughtful and proactive plan to ensure we are prepared for a smooth transition in the leadership of our company. Let's begin by addressing the issue that's been in the news recently. As you know, the Ohio speaker of the house and four others were arrested on Tuesday on federal criminal charges. The case involves political activity related to Ohio House Bill 6, which recognizes the value of the nuclear power plants operated by our former subsidiary FirstEnergy Solutions now known as Energy Harbor. Also on Tuesday, FirstEnergy Corp., our FirstEnergy Services Company, subsidiary, and our political action committee were served subpoenas related to this matter. We are having discussions with the Department of Justice lawyers and will fully comply with the subpoenas. I believe that FirstEnergy acted properly in this matter and we intend to cooperate fully with the investigation to among other things, ensure our company and our role and supporting House Bill 6 is understood as accurately as possible. In the meantime, we wanted to share our preliminary perspective on this issue, and reinforce the values with which we operate our company. This is a serious and disturbing situation. Ethical behavior and upholding the highest standards of conduct are foundational values for the entire FirstEnergy family and me personally. These high standards have fostered the trust of our employees, our customers, and the financial community. We strive to apply these standards in all business dealings, including our participation in the political process. As you know, we have supported keeping Ohio's two nuclear plants in operation. We believe in supporting the thousands of families, former FirstEnergy families who rely on the jobs those plants provide. These are good taxpaying jobs that we believe are critical to Ohio's economic development efforts. We also believe that is in the best interest of all Ohioans and our nation to maintain these sources of zero carbon, clean, affordable, and reliable energy. So as we discussed on previous earnings calls, we supported legislative solutions for the nuclear plants, even after we stopped operating them. We were strong supporters of House Bill 6 and oppose the referendum effort to repeal it. We gave our support because FirstEnergy has the obligation to serve 2 million customers in the state of Ohio, including looking out for their long-term energy supply, even though we are no longer in the competitive generation business and would not get a single dollar of the House Bill 6 funding for those plants. In addition, that passage of House Bill 6 resulted in a rate decrease for Ohio customers, despite the nuclear surcharges, but let me be clear at no time does our support for nuclear plants in Ohio interfere or supersede our ethical obligations to conduct our business properly. The facts will become clear as the investigation progresses, and we support bringing the facts forward. Our leadership team will remain focused on executing our strategy and running our business in the same conscientious manner that you've come to expect. With that, let's talk about the other developments since our last call. I know the impact of the pandemic and economic slowdown remains on everyone's mind. Our business strategy remains resilient and we are well-positioned to continue managing through the COVID-19 crisis. We continue making our planned investments and deploying capital across our system and we\u2019ve not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain or workforce. To protect the health and safety of our employees, their families and our customers we made adjustments to our work procedures early in the pandemic, and we've continued refining those practices over the last several months. Our employees both those in the field and the 7,000, who transitioned to working from home in March haven't missed a beat. Our team has rallied together in the face of this challenge. We've established a workplace return plan for our employees who are working from home, but given their strong performance during the past few months, we're in no rush to get them back to the office. Likewise, I'm extremely proud of our physical workforce for the great job they've done. They have adopted new protocols to keep each other safe while continuing to provide the electricity our customers need. We continue following all established precautions for preventing the spread of this virus. That includes cleaning and disinfecting measures, temperature checks, mask, and adjustments to reporting locations, work schedules, and crew sizes. I'm pleased to note that this increased focus on protections from COVID has extended beyond the virus and helped drive a stronger overall safety performance for our company through the first six months of this year. At FirstEnergy, safety is an unwavering core value and we will continue to provide employees with a safe working environment as we do our part to stop the spread of this disease. As I said during our last call, one of the silver linings of this crisis is the first energy team is coming together to work smarter more creatively and more efficiently than ever before. Other events in our country, namely the outcry over inequality and social injustice faced by people of color have also brought us together with a deeper sense of urgency and a renewed focus on the areas of diversity and inclusion. This is an issue we had already been working to address within FirstEnergy for a number of years, and we are actively taking steps across the company to help drive positive changes and promote equality within our workforce and our communities. Let's move to our second quarter results. Yesterday, after market closed, we reported earnings of $0.57 per share on both the GAAP and operating earnings basis. This was at the upper end of the earnings guidance we provided for the quarter. While John will discuss the drivers in more detail later in the call, I'll point out that as we expected, our business model and rate structure provided a measure of stability during this period of pandemic and economic slowdown. As we discussed in April, about two-thirds of our base distribution revenues come from residential sales with 28% from commercial customers and about 7% from the industrial sector. In addition, about 80% of commercial rates and 90% of industrial rates are made up of customer and demand charges. As a result, what we told you in April has [borne-out] through this quarter. While weather adjusted load dropped by almost 4% system-wide compared to the second quarter of 2019, the increase in residential revenues related to the stay-at-home orders in our service territory more than offset the decreases in the commercial and industrial sectors. While I don't think anyone is in a position to predict what the future might bring in terms of continued reopening, or re-closing of the economy, we're taking conservative view of what the next few months might bring. Nevertheless, we remained very positive that we are well-positioned to continue managing the impact of the pandemic, and the economic slowdown, and we believe our distribution and transmission investments will continue to provide stable and predictable earnings. We\u2019re affirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We're also affirming our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021, and 5% to 7%, extending through 2023, as well as our plan to issue up to a total of $600 million in equity in 2022 and 2023. Also for the third quarter of 2020, we're introducing an earnings guidance range of $0.73 to $0.83 per share. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve Strah. Steve Strah : Thanks Chuck. It's good to talk with all of you again today in my new capacity. I\u2019ll walk-through a brief update on some regulatory matters, as well as our operations. To begin, we are pleased that since our last call the Utility Commission's of West Virginia and New Jersey have both authorized deferral mechanisms for incremental COVID-19 related costs. And the Pennsylvania PUC authorized a deferral mechanism for uncollectible expenses. As we told you in April, Maryland was the first state in our service territory to put such a mechanism in place, and we already had existing riders in Ohio and New Jersey for uncollectible expenses. As you know, our regulatory calendar is very light through 2023. And we only have a few open matters at this time. I'll touch on some recent developments. In New Jersey, an ALJ was assigned for the distribution base rate case we filed in February. As you'll recall, we are seeking to recover increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our JCP&L customers, along with recovery of storm costs incurred over the past few years. We anticipate a procedural scheduled to be issued soon, and we remain optimistic that we can reach a favorable settlement with the parties in the case. Also in New Jersey, we are in settlement discussions with our formula rate filing for JCP&Ls transmission assets. In December, FERC accepted our application to move these assets into a former \u2013 forward- looking formula rate effective January 1, 2020, subject to refund. This supports our plan for approximately $175 million in customer focused capital spending on the JCP&L transmission system this year. Moving to the operations front, as Chuck indicated earlier, we continue to execute our plans for 2020. Even with the significant precautions to keep our employees and customers safe, we remain on track to make more than $3 billion in customer focused investments to strengthen and modernize our transmission and distribution systems this year, with the goal of enhancing reliability, resiliency and security, while improving operational efficiency.  Thank you for your time. And now I'll turn it over to John Taylor for the financial review. John Taylor : Good morning. It's great to speak with you today. Consistent with our normal practices, you will find all reconciliations along with other detailed information about the quarter in the strategic and financial highlights document that's posted to our website. Now let's review our results. As Chuck said, we reported second quarter GAAP and operating earnings of $0.57 a share, which is near the top end of earnings guidance. In our distribution business, revenue has increased compared to the second quarter of 2019 as a result of higher residential usage, incremental rider revenue in both Ohio and Pennsylvania, and higher weather related usage. This benefit was offset by the absence of the Ohio DMR revenue, which ended in July 2019 and higher expenses, including non-deferred COVID expenses, I'll describe in a moment. Total distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the second quarter of 2019 on both an actual and weather adjusted basis. Heating degree days were approximately 27% above normal and 58% higher than the second quarter of 2019, while cooling degree days were 2% above normal and 6% higher than the same period last year. The stay at home orders in our service territories drove an increase in total residential sales of 17.1% or 14.8% on a weather adjusted basis, compared to the same period last year. In the commercial customer class, we saw a sales decrease of 14.4% on an actual basis in 14.5% when adjusted for weather compared to the second quarter of 2019. And in our industrial class, second quarter load decreased 11.7% compared to the same period last year. As Chuck indicated earlier, the increased residential volumes more than offset the decrease in C&I load from a revenue perspective, for a benefit of $0.04 per share in the quarter. Let me spend a moment on our COVID related expenses, which impacted earnings by about $0.04 per share in the quarter. As Steve mentioned earlier, all of our utilities are able to defer uncollectible expenses that are incremental to amounts included in base rates, as well as other COVID related costs in New Jersey, Maryland, and West Virginia. Uncollectible expense increased in the quarter due to the pandemic and reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. This represents the amount of uncollectibles currently being collected through base rates, and as a result could not be deferred. The remainder of our increase in uncollectibles was all deferred for future recovery with no impact on earnings.  While the pandemic is still very fluid, we continue to expect that deferral mechanisms we have in place and our focus on managing O&M spin will mitigate the impact of COVID costs and keep us on track to meet our financial commitments. In our transmission business, earnings decreased slightly, primarily due to higher net financing costs, and the reconciliation of the estimated versus actual true-ups of our 2019 formula rates. We continue to see earnings growth associated with our ongoing energizing the future transmission investment program. And in our corporate segment, our results reflect higher operating expenses, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Before we open up the call to your questions, I'd like to discuss a few other financial matters, starting with our pension performance. As a result of our conservative investment strategy, which we described last quarter, our pension plan continues to outperform the turbulent market. Asset returns were at 5.7% as of June 30, and as of today, we are around 9% tracking above our 7.5% annual target. Our investment committee has taken prudent steps to further de-risk the plans asset allocation in anticipation of additional market volatility with the goal of preserving the plans year to date asset returns and to protect the plans funded status, which remains unchanged at 77%. Finally in June, we successfully completed the refinancing of $750 million in FirstEnergy Corp. debt at a blended rate of 2%. We also completed $175 million debt financing at Potomac Edison and in July we completed a $250 million debt financing at CEI. Our liquidity remains strong at $3.5 billion, with our credit facilities in place through December 2022. In light of the current investigation, I want you to know that we are currently compliant with all covenants and can make the necessary representations and warranties as required under our credit facilities to borrow money. In regard to our financing plan, our debt maturities are minimal through 2021 with only $74 million expiring next year, and our new money requirements are very manageable with only two transactions remaining in 2018 totaling $250 million in only four transactions in 2021, totaling $575 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chuck for some closing comments before we begin Q&A. Chuck Jones : Thanks, John. There was an erroneous media report that FirstEnergy had held an investor meeting yesterday. No such meeting happened. So, if anyone was feeling left out, I wanted to make that correction. In my earlier comments, I tried to candidly address the investigation by speaking from the heart and giving you a sense of where we are and what we currently know.  As we move to the Q&A, I would really like to let my prepared marks stand. Please recognize that I won't be able to speak to any great detail on many of your questions. I appreciate your understanding on that. And I really hope we can focus the Q&A on the great quarter we just reported on. Now we'll take the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Hi, good morning. Chuck Jones : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi, Chuck. Can\u2019t help but asking so, as best you can answer, could you maybe give more color on, in terms of the payments that are talked about to this [501C4]. How much was added from FE versus FES and why \u2013 did you have any control over FES payments as well? Chuck Jones : Well, first, let me take the second half first, and as of November 16, when we essentially made the competitive generation business non-core, FES separated fiduciary, financially, and operationally from being a part of FirstEnergy. They put in place an independent board, and from November 16, I've had no input into any of the decisions they've made. Obviously, we've had a lot of discussions between the two companies as it relates to transition shared services and so forth, but in terms of decision making authority mine ended in November of 2016. On your specific question, as I've said, I'm not going to get into the details of the case, but I will say this, that of the funds that are referenced in the Department of Justice affidavit, FirstEnergy\u2019s share of that is about 25%. And in the context of 5.5 years of meeting or exceeding every earnings commitment that we've given you every quarter, we do make prudent decisions to spend corporate funds on issues that we believe are important to our customers and shareholders. Beyond that, we intend to provide the details on what we spent, how we spent it to the Department of Justice in the coming weeks. Steve Fleishman : Okay. I'm not sure you can comment on this, but can you talk about the reference like phone calls between you and other leadership and these \u2013 some of these folks? Could you talk to that at all? Is\u2026 Chuck Jones : No, I'm not going to talk to that. I talk to a lot of people, I text with a lot of people. I\u2019d probably text more than I talk these days, so we have to see what they're talking about. I can tell you this, in every meeting, every phone call, every text message that I participate in, I talked about our obligations to conduct our business transparently, ethically, professionally. I have no worries that I did anything that wasn't that way and we let the merits of our arguments carry the day when we are operating in a political environment. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Just for color because everyone seems to focus on this $60 million of spending, just how much did the other side spend? And do they have similar 501C4s on this HB6? Chuck Jones : Steve, our share was 25%. I'm not going to speak for the other side. You're going to have to go talk to them. Steve Fleishman : I meant people that oppose the law, I'm sorry. Chuck Jones : Well, the interesting thing about that is it's all \u2013 you know it's all \u2013 we don't know who spent it because it was spent through similar organizations, legal 501C4 organizations, where donors aren't and I don't know the amount that was spent on the other side. But clearly, this was a provocative, difficult issue in the state of Ohio. A lot of money was spent on both sides of this issue, particularly after House Bill 6 was passed and it got into the referendum process, the process of gathering signatures, the media ads, there was a lot of money spent on both sides and 501C4s were used on both sides. Steve Fleishman : One last quick question, Chuck, just are you going to do \u2013 is the Board going to do some kind of like independent review of all this as part of the response? Could you give more color on that? Chuck Jones : Right now, we're planning to do an internal review of everything involved in the affidavit, which obviously is going to be necessary for us to respond to the questions in the subpoena. I think the Department of Justice review is the most important review that needs to get going and get completed. Steve Fleishman : Right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Chuck Jones : Hi, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Just on the similar topic, can you just maybe give us a little bit more granularity on the separation process in 2018? I know \u2013 we understand some of the IT and things like payment processing continue to go through a company, a service company, so FE Corp. for some time, but it isn't like clear how everything else was actually bifurcated, i.e., sort of at the management level. You know how much interaction did FE, you know, corporate senior management have with FES after the filing? When were the non-back ended functions actually split? Chuck Jones : Well, in November of 2016, we were providing on the order of $300 million worth of corporate shared services to the generation business. The process of winding all that down went all the way to the date where they emerged from bankruptcy and even beyond that. I can't tell you the specifics of when each individual functions ceased to be performed by the transition shared services agreement and when FES or Energy Harbor started to do that on their own. I can't answer the question of whether our executives were involved in the running of FES or Energy Harbor at any point after November of 2016. And the answer is no, we were not involved. We created corporate separation for a reason. We had to get about negotiating, you know, a plan of separation with FES, its bondholders, its creditors. There's no way we could have done that by operating on both sides. So, we severed those ties. We were not involved in any way in the decisions made by FES. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then several of sort of the individuals charged are long time lobbyists who interacted to some degree with company A and company A1 over the time period in question, can you tell us with any kind of specific what \u2013 you know what their affiliation was with both A and A1? For example, on, you know, individual peers to have a contact with sort of, you know, both the enterprises in question, you know, let's maybe just elaborate a little bit on the affiliations of those that were charged? Chuck Jones : Well, let me say this, we do employ lobbyists. When we do, we expect them to act in the same ethical manner that we hold ourselves accountable for. The lobbyists named in the affidavit and subsequently arrested did not work for FirstEnergy on House Bill 6. And to my knowledge, they have never worked for FirstEnergy. Who they worked for? I'm not sure, but I know they did not work for us. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then, Chuck, just one last question, and just to follow-up on Steve's on the 501C4, what was like the underlining, you know, vetting process at the time for making those payments? I mean, would Regulatory Affairs just request them and receive approval freely? I guess, how do you assess whether those funds were directed towards that 501C would be used for like \u201csocietal benefits versus political aspirations\u201d? Chuck Jones : With all due respect Shar, I'm going to stay away from that question. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Well, thanks, you know, Chuck, for addressing some of this. I know it's a tough subject and the visibility is really important. So thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Julien Dumolin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. At risk of delving into the obvious again, if I can follow on Shar\u2019s line of questioning, on the services arrangement, I just want to understand the historical setup here. You know, obviously, this historical arrangement on the services side lasted for some time, as you just articulated, but with respect to the External Affairs piece of this, how do you think about the decision making under that services arrangement, right? Because if you can clarify a little bit, I understand that you all were doing a lot of different things, you know, including running material affairs for them, which would presumably include some of these related activities. How do you think about what that would include and in running a services arrangement, what does that mean in terms of their decision making versus your own, if you can articulate that a little bit more? Chuck Jones : External Affairs was one of the areas that they separated very quickly and put in place their own Vice President of External Affairs, began working with their own law firms, began working with and hiring their own lobbyists. We were virtually out of the External Affairs business for FES very shortly after November of 2016. So, it's a bad assumption to assume that we were doing that for them, we were not. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Right. So to the extent that you are running a services arrangement for them in other facets for a longer duration, including seemingly through some for 2020, it's specifically in the context of External Affairs, which would presumably include lobbing that seems to terminated very quickly, if [indiscernible]? Chuck Jones : Yes, I think you should think about it more in terms of Administrative Affairs that we were providing them, payroll, HR services, some, you know, financial services, IT services, those types of things we were providing. You know, it took a while to figure out how to get that all separated, but the things that are involved with leading and running a company, all separated very early. Julien Dumolin-Smith: And then if I can ask, when you think about the funding of the 501C4, I mean, to the extent to which that you've done this in the past, you've done \u2013 you contributed to the 501 before even prior to the separation of the companies here. I mean, that is not necessarily in question here, just to be very clear with you all, when you think about the investigation, you know, I just want to separate perceptions from proximate realities for the case, if you can speak to that and activities in 501C4s? Chuck Jones : I bracketed the amount of money that we spent on House Bill 6, I'm not going to get into the details of how we spent it on this call. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Understood. Last question for you super quick. I know you've articulated your own plans about that transition of the management team, and that was obviously [indiscernible] how do you think about your [Technical Difficulty]. Chuck Jones : We're losing you Julien, I can't hear your question. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Sorry. Do you think you'll stay on to the pendency of the investigation just to help [indiscernible]? Chuck Jones : Well, to my knowledge, I've never articulated anything that what we've publicly said. And I think I've said that I have made no definitive retirement plans and it certainly won't be this year, and I absolutely am not going to \u2013 you know, not going to \u2013 not do my part to help restore the reputation of this company to what it truly deserves. Julien Dumolin-Smith : Absolutely. Alright. All the best. Good luck. Chuck Jones : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi, Good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Just wanted to talk about FES and governance there, was there any FirstEnergy executives on the board of FES post-2016? Chuck Jones : Excuse me, say that again, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Post-2016 at FES, were there any FirstEnergy executives or other FirstEnergy folks on the Board of FES? Chuck Jones : No FirstEnergy executives were on the board of FES. Stephen Byrd : Okay, thank you. And then just another question \u2026 Chuck Jones : The FES selected independent directors and I think Donnie Schneider, who was the President of FirstEnergy Solutions was on the Board, but no FE executives served on that Board. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Thank you. And then just another question on the statement that the company made about this that you don't believe anything was done wrong. There's a fairly short tone between the subpoenas being issued to a number of FirstEnergy entities in that statement and I guess I'm just wondering [and no delicate] way to ask you exactly that, it\u2019s a pretty short time to kind of make an assessment to make sure that everyone felt confident that no one at FirstEnergy was doing anything wrong. What gives you the confidence that no one was doing anything wrong given the short amount of time between the subpoenas and the statement issued? Chuck Jones : I would just say that \u2013 so first of all, our statement was that we believe that FirstEnergy acted properly in our dealings on House Bill 6. We can't speak to what happened by anybody other than FirstEnergy. The financial support we provided to House Bill 6 isn't complicated. We know what we did. We know why we did it. We're looking forward to sharing that with the Department of Justice. That's what gives me the confidence to be able to say that we acted properly. Stephen Byrd : Okay, understood. And just last question, in terms of \u2013 we've seen some rating agencies\u2019 sort of action statements recently, do you see any need to support your credit position in the near-to-medium term given those statements? Or do your equity plan sort of span and you don't see that need given what we've seen already from the rating agencies on this investigation? Chuck Jones : Well, first of all, we've got plenty of liquidity right now. And as you might imagine, I spoke to both S&P and Moody's since Tuesday, we've seen what S&P did. You know they put us on a 90-day negative watch. You know, when I spoke to them both, I'll tell you what I told them. I told them that they should not put the ratings integrity of their ratings on the line for FirstEnergy. That it\u2019s my job and our company's executive teams job to take care of our reputation, and we will do that, but I also told them that we're the same underlying company that existed before Tuesday. We've got an improving balance sheet, FFO-to-debt that's moving into the 12% to 13% range, strong earnings CAGR and that's the company that we are and that hasn't changed. And as we work through the process with the Justice Department, it's going to be the same company when we come out of it from a financial profile definitely. Steve, anything you want to add to the specifics on the liquidity question? Steve Strah : No, Chuck. I mean our liquidity is strong at $3.5 billion. We have access to it. We can make all the reps and warranties under the facilities and expect to be able to do that moving forward. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Just last question for me, have you had dialogue with PUCO since this investigation was announced and anything just to report on that side of things? Chuck Jones : I have had no dialogue with the PUCO. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning. Chuck Jones : Hi, Paul. Paul Patterson : So, as you know, there's discussion about repealing HB 6. I'm just thinking other than the decoupling provision, is there any other significant or potential significant impact that would happen if it was repealed and not replaced? And also sort of likewise in the same area, since FES has emerged from bankruptcy, are there any contingencies or anything that we should think about that \u2013 or obligations to FirstEnergy, I mean to whatever Energy Harbor since you guys \u2013 since it's removed \u2013 since it's now out of bankruptcy, if you follow me? Chuck Jones : Alright, so the first question is if House Bill 6 is repealed, what else happens? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that House Bill 6, when it went into law, actually resulted in a rate reduction for our customers despite the surcharges related to the nuclear plants and that was as a result of some of the, you know, previous payments that were being made for customers for renewable energy charges. It would depend how it\u2019s repealed, how it's replaced, if at all. On what happens with those renewable energy surcharges on the decoupling piece, you know, decoupling provisions in the House Bill 6 can have many benefits. You know it provides rate certainty for both customers and shareholders until our next base rate case. You know, in the case of shareholders, it could provide a benefit depending on whether during a normal economic downturn, but right now, as I've said, with loads up due to workers being at home as a result of the pandemic combined with hot weather last month and this month, decoupling is actually providing a benefit to the customers. So, you know, if decoupling goes away, those are the types of benefits that are going to go away. Paul Patterson : Okay, but any financial impact to you guys other than outside of decoupling? I mean, I'm just thinking like is there anything \u2013 the decoupling thing is there, other than that going away, is there any financial impact that we should think about potentially, again, absent decoupling that we should think about with? Chuck Jones : No, not anything that's significant nor that we could accommodate within our plan. Paul Patterson : Okay. Chuck Jones : It's a few pennies of share, probably maximum, that it would benefit us. And as I said, if it's not there, the real risk is also shared by customers because they'd be paying a whole lot higher electric bills this summer than they're paying. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then just with FES post-bankruptcy, your \u2013 is there any contingency or obligations that you have to them? Chuck Jones : No, there's no change in our settlement agreement with FES and its bondholders, creditors and all of the other parties. The plan of reorganization was not contingent on House Bill 6 or any other support for the nuclear plants. There's no true-ups, any other financial obligations from FE to FES other than what was in our agreement that was approved by the court. Paul Patterson : Okay. But that agreed, so that was \u2013 okay, I guess what I'm saying is that, should we \u2013 if something happens to FES, should we be concerned about it having any potential impact on you guys, since it's now emerged from bankruptcy et cetera, do you follow what I'm saying? Chuck Jones : Well, the last I know, they were sitting on $900 plus million of cash. I don't \u2013 you know I can't speak for what's going on out there. That was a public announcement they made back in March. I don't \u2013 I'm not sitting here at all worried about that part of what used to be part of our company. Paul Patterson : Okay. Appreciate that. And then, just in general, I mean, [82] pages of lots of information is put out there and obviously some of it is associated with the individuals that are arrested, I can see some sort of issue with. It's not clear to me what the actual, if any allegations that are actually being made about FirstEnergy in a legal manner have been being done illegally if you follow me. I have, of course, nothing to subpoena or what have you, but how should we think about that? I guess, when we look at the \u2026 Chuck Jones : I'm going to let my prepared remarks stand on that question. Paul Patterson : Okay. Again, thanks so much hang in there. Chuck Jones : All right. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Fremont of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Paul Fremont : Thank you. Basically, I just want \u2013 I want to start by following up on Steve Byrd's question. If you were faced with the prospect of a potential rating, downgrade by Standard & Poor's would you alter your equity financing plans to descend the rating or would you allow for the rating to go down? Chuck Jones : I think in the short-term, we wouldn't do anything drastic. We wouldn't change our plan. And we would work to get them to the point where they're comfortable restoring our rating. Paul Fremont : Okay. John Taylor : As I said, the underlying financials of this company haven't changed. Our balance sheet is getting stronger. We're moving into the 12% to 13% range. You know, S&P has a 12% threshold there. We're not going to go below that. If they were to downgrade us as a result of this news, as I've said, it's our job to get this news behind us and when that happens, I would expect them to restore the rating that's appropriate. Paul Fremont : Got it. Were you aware of the investigation prior to the FBI\u2019s announcement and press conference this week or without the first time that you became aware of the investigation? Chuck Jones : I'm not going to comment on that one. Paul Fremont : Okay. Chuck Jones : It'd be really nice. We got about 15 minutes left, if we could actually talk about the great quarter that we had at some point here. Paul Fremont : I just have one more question. And I guess part of the affidavit alleges that there was a payment by you to one of the lobbyists, is that in correct that you made a payment to that lobbyist? Chuck Jones : I would just say this, I think that the CEO reference in some of that affidavit wasn't me. I don't know who it was, but it was not me and I've never made a payment directly to a lobbyist in my life nor asked any lobbyists to make a payment to anyone else on behalf of our company in my life. Paul Fremont : Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I actually want to dive in. Thank you, Chuck. I want to dive into something that is a bit regulatory related and is Ohio related, but it's something you deal with every year. You have your 2019 significantly excessive earnings test application out there. And the 2018 one, I don't think ever got ruled on. Your own data in the 2019 one shows a little over $300 million of net income next year, Ohio distribution utilities or about not quite 4 billion of rate base. Just curious how you're thinking about a, the process for resolving the last two seat tests; and b, the potential risk of a rate reduction in Ohio as a result of the seat test, and is that a rate reduction, if any happened? Would that be a one-time kind of refund to customers or would that be an ongoing lowering of rates? John Taylor : Hey, Michael, this is John. You know, as you look at the seat test, you know, we filed that back in May a 10.9% return on equity. The two biggest drivers in that, there were some lower costs in 2019 versus 2018, lower interest cost and then we had some one-off expenses in 2018 that we incurred, but the bigger impact was that the Ohio utilities paid a dividend up to FE Corp. probably a little bit more than they have typically done in the past just because they hadn't paid a dividend in quite some time. So that was the key driver in the increase in the return on equity. I don't foresee any issues at the 10.9%. We\u2019re well below the thresholds. And I think that will be \u2013 will resolve itself over some period of time. I can't remember the regulatory timeframe, maybe Eileen, if you want to talk through the regulatory timeframe on when that gets approved or how the process works for the seat. Eileen Mikkelsen : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. It's Eileen Mikkelsen, Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Thanks, John. The processes as you said, each year we make a filing in May reporting on our prior year's earnings, consistent with the statutory language with respect to the significantly excessive earnings test. At that time, we really wait for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to establish a procedural schedule for folks to provide comments on that seat filing, and then make a determination of whether or not we need to move to hearings or not move to hearings before they make a judgment about whether or not we have significantly excessive earnings. But John, as you said, with the filing at 10.9% we are not concerned that we have significantly excessive earnings in our Ohio utilities. Michael Lapides : Okay. So, does that mean, are there any issues with the 2018 seat test, because I may be wrong, but I didn't think the commission had actually issued an order one way or the other on that. It just seems a little unusual for the 2018 one to be outstanding still when the 2019 one got bought. Eileen Mikkelsen : There is no procedural schedule established as yet for resolving the 2018 seat proceeding. So, we await the establishment of a procedural schedule and then we will act accordingly, but again, that 2018 filing was 8.8% and so on a consolidated basis. So, again, no concerns that we have significantly excessive earnings in Ohio in 2018. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Chuck Jones : Take care of Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just maybe if you guys could provide a little bit more color on your conversations with the rating agencies and just try to understand a little better what exactly their concerns are, as they were communicated to you because like you pointed out, fundamentally the business, underlying business is on the right trajectory and remain strong, just curious what is it that they afraid of? Thank you. Chuck Jones : I don't have any more color to provide. I pretty much shared everything that I discussed with them and I think he didn't mean to read what they wrote and call them if you have more questions. Sophie Karp : All right. And then secondly, if I may quickly follow up, you went through a regulatory president to establish the decoupling mechanism. So presumably, if that was reversed, you would have to go to that similar proceeding again. And my question is, would that in any way trigger a full rate review in your opinion? Thank you. Chuck Jones : There wasn't a full rate review to implement the coupling, I would hardly think that there would be one to decoupling. Sophie Karp : Alright. Thank you. Chuck Jones : Okay. Thank you, Sophie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just really, quickly, first on Q3 guidance, any comment on what you're assuming in terms of COVID impacts clearly things in Q2 tend to be trending better than where you are at least the Q1 call? John Taylor : Hi Durgesh. This is John. I think, you know, if you look at this second quarter load on a weather adjusted basis, you were down 4%, residential was up 15, commercials down 15, industrials down 12, I think you could probably assume the total, you know, 4% load reduction off a prior year will be consistent, but my sense is the mix will be different. We're starting to see residential come down slightly. We're starting to see commercial improve slightly and industrial improved slightly. So, I think the mix will be, you know, different, but the load in terms of just total load versus last year will be fairly consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. With respect to COVID related costs, you know, we have the deferral mechanisms on uncollectible expenses, and all that's been recorded up to what we have in base rates. So, I don't anticipate any issues there. And the other COVID costs that we're incurring in the main, they're not that significant. So, I don't anticipate any impact from COVID in the third quarter. Durgesh Chopra : Understood, thanks. And then just Chuck, quickly, going back to FES liabilities, I just wanted to make sure I understood that clearly. So, as I recall through the bankruptcy proceeding, you have some obligations on specifically nuclear decommissioning and coal ash, if FES were to get in any kind of financial trouble, are you saying that you're okay with where those stress balances are that you're comfortable in that whole situation? I'm just trying to understand that will those obligations be FirstEnergy obligations if FirstEnergy situation does get into any kind of financial trouble or no? Chuck Jones : Durgesh, you have \u2013 you do not understand correctly. We have no obligations for nuclear decommissioning. We have no direct obligations for any coal ash. We put in place a surety bond, as part of our agreement that we negotiated with FES to ensure the coal ash mitigation happened properly, but that bond is in place and it was part of our Separation Agreement that was approved by the bankruptcy court, and we have no other ongoing financial obligations. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Thanks for taking my question and I will say congratulation on a good quarter. Chuck Jones : Thanks. Andrew Weisel : If I can just elaborate on the seat and more specifically, you\u2019ve disclosed the earned ROE of 10.9% in Ohio for 2019, but when I look at the net income of the subsidiaries subtract out the DMR and just do the simple algebra, it points to something significantly higher like north of 20%, can you just help me reconcile those numbers and why it seems like a pretty big disparity between the [10.9] and what the net income from those subsidiaries look like? John Taylor : Yeah. So, this is John. So, I think what you see in our Ohio utilities, financial statements and what's included and see, obviously we start with what's in the financials, but there are exclusions per the regulations and adjustments that you need to make in order to calculate the seat. And so, you know, I don't have the list of adjustments on the top of my head here and probably wouldn't be a good use of time to go through every single adjustment on the call, but there are certain adjustments that we make, not only in the income that's reported by the utilities, but also in the equity that's reported by the utilities. It is a rolling 13-month average equity balance that's used to calculate the 10.9% or the 8.8% in the previous year. So, there are some adjustments that we would just need to walk through, and we could do that offline, if that makes sense. Andrew Weisel : Could you maybe just give one or two of the biggest still? I mean, you're talking about like a doubling of net income versus what the dumb guide math would imply? Eileen Mikkelsen : It's Eileen. Thinking of the adjustments like John, we can take this offline, but coming to mind for example, Ohio Edison has Penn Power as a subsidiary, so we have to adjust Penn Power out because that is not relevant to the Ohio ratemaking formula. So, there's things like that that are included that are necessary adjustments in order to meet the statutory test. Andrew Weisel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question this morning is coming from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Yeah. Chuck, I was skeptical. Your revenues would be as resilient as they were. So, you know, with respect to COVID-19 after the last quarter, but they certainly were this quarter. So, I'll give you that [add able on] the quarter. And then\u2026 Chuck Jones : Thank you. Hey Charles, and also I saw you quoted in some of the media earlier this week. Thank you for the vote of confidence. Charles Fishman : Okay, well, you're welcome. Okay, so since I did that, I forget just one quick question on Ohio. Okay, the DCR. Connect the opened up, as far as the ROE are we pretty much on autopilot until the ESP expires in 2024? Chuck Jones : Eileen will take that. Eileen Mikkelsen : Thanks Chuck. With respect to DCR in Ohio, I would agree we are on autopilot through the end of our ESP, which is currently in effect through May of 2024. Charles Fishman : Okay. Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all I have. Chuck Jones : Thank you, Charles. Alright. Thank you all for your support. Thanks for at least getting a few questions on the quarter. We'll talk to you again when it's appropriate. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's events. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information Link and in our SEC filings. I would also call your attention to a new risk factor that is included in the 8-K, we filed this morning. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today's discussion. Participants in today's call include our Executive Director, Chris Pappas; Acting Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor. We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session. For those of you who do not know Chris, he has been an independent member of the FirstEnergy Board since 2011, and he retired in 2019 as President and Chief Executive Officer of Trinseo S.A.  I'll turn it over now to Chris. Christopher Pappas : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's call. I'm going to start out by discussing the leadership transition the company announced last week, my role with the company and the Board's governance efforts. First, I will note that the DOJ investigation prompted a number of shareholder and customer lawsuits, and we are also responding to a subpoena we received from the SEC on September 2. Related to the investigation in the FirstEnergy by the SEC Division of Enforcement, we are cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC. During the course of our internal review related to the ongoing government investigation regarding House Bill 6, the independent review committee of the Board determined that three executives violated certain FirstEnergy policies and its code of conduct. When we determined that employee conduct is inconsistent with our policy and values, no matter how senior the individual, we have a duty to take action, and that is what we have done here. As a result, FirstEnergy announced on Thursday that CEO, Chuck Jones, along with Dennis Chack, Senior Vice President of Product Development, Marketing and Branding, and Mike Dowling, Senior Vice President of External Affairs were all terminated effective immediately. Concurrently, Steve Strah, who many of you know from his roles as FirstEnergy's President and previously CFO was appointed acting CEO. Steve has the experience, credibility and the support of the Board in this role. Steve is a highly respected executive with deep knowledge of FirstEnergy's business and significant operational experience. He became President in May, 2020 as part of the company's ordinary-course succession planning process. In his various leadership roles at the company, including his recent tenure as CFO and President, Steve has supported the execution of FirstEnergy's long-term customer-focused growth strategy and demonstrated his commitment to delivering value to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. I look forward to working closely with him in my new role as Executive Director. In this role, I remain an independent member of the Board, and will also work closely with Don Misheff, our Non-Executive Chairman to assist management team's execution of strategic initiatives, to engage with the company's external stakeholders, including the investment community as appropriate and to support the development of enhanced controls and governance policies and procedures. The Board is already conducting a full review as governance and oversight processes to look for areas of improvement going forward. This is a serious matter for our Board and for FirstEnergy management. In order to address this in a timely and effective way, the Board has formed a new subcommittee of our audit committee to quickly assess and implement potential changes as appropriate in the company's compliance program. This effort will be led by independent Board member, Leslie Turner. Leslie retired as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Hershey Company. She joined our Board in 2018 and is a member of the audit and compensation committees. This new subcommittee will work with management, internal audit and also engage outside expertise for help and best practices. As I previously mentioned, we have and will continue to cooperate with the DOJ and SEC investigations. We have also reached out to company\u2019s key stakeholders, including the ratings agencies, banks, regulators, legislators, and union leadership. We believe the actions the Board has taken, represent an additional step towards addressing these matters and enables FirstEnergy\u2019s management to continue to focus on running the business day-to-day. FirstEnergy embarked on a strategy several years ago to becoming fully regulated company and grow through the substantial opportunities available in both the distribution and transmission businesses. That strategy will continue. It is working and the foundational drivers are intact. The FirstEnergy organization at large has been delivering excellent results over the last few years, and that continues with the strong performance year-to-date and the company's expectations for the full-year. As we look ahead, the Board has full confidence in Steve and the rest of the team's ability to ensure a seamless transition and to continue to execute the company strategy. With that, I'll now turn it over to Steve. Steven Strah : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Well I would have preferred to have assumed my new role under different circumstances. I agree with Chris that the actions taken by our Board of Directors last week were absolutely necessary and are an additional step towards addressing this matter. The management team is committed to working with the Board to assess and implement potential changes as appropriate with the company's compliance program. We take this as a serious and important matter, and we will begin to address this immediately. In my 36 years with the company, we have faced challenges and changes, and we have always emerged stronger and even more dedicated to our mission. Our management team remains focused on keeping each other safe, providing reliable service to our customers and executing our growth initiatives. I am confident that we will continue to carry out this plan, finish the year strong, and enter 2021 with momentum. I look forward to working with our team to achieve this. With that, let me transition to a brief update on our operations and recent regulatory activity, then Jon will review our results and other financial matters. While the pandemic continues to impact our work protocols, our customers' lives and the economy, I am extremely proud of the hard work and resiliencies our employees have demonstrated throughout this crisis. We remain on pace to complete more than $3 billion in customer-focused investments across our system this year, and our business model and rate structure continue to provide stability. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.84 per share, $0.01 above the top-end of our guidance range. Those results primarily reflect the successful implementation of our regulated growth strategies and favorable weather together with a continuation of the pandemic-driven load trends we noted on our second quarter call. As Jon will discuss in more detail, the earnings impact of higher weather-adjusted sales from residential customers, more than offset the lower usage in our commercial and industrial sectors. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and the expectations for the next couple months, we are affirming our guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and currently expect to be near the top-end of that range. If decoupling is part of a House Bill 6 repeal, we would be closer to the $2.50 per share midpoint. We have updated our funds from operations and free cash flow forecast for 2020 to reflect the impacts of higher storm costs of approximately $145 million and higher costs associated with the pandemic, including uncollectibles of approximately $120 million, most of which are deferred for future recovery. Although, the events of this past week and the government investigations create additional uncertainty, we are affirming our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021 and 5% to 7% extending through 2023 along with our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023. With that said, we are mindful that the current situation may present additional challenges to meet this objective. Jon will address some tactics we are taking to address uncertainty created by the investigation. Now let's turn to regulatory matters. In New Jersey, JCP&L filed an AMI implementation plan with the Board of Public Utilities in late August. If approved, we would begin installing 1.15 million smart meters and related infrastructure across our New Jersey service territory over a three-year period, beginning in 2023. Also at JCP&L, last week, we were very pleased that the BPU approved our settlement in the distribution base rate case, as well as the sale of JCP&L interest in the Yards Creek Pumped Storage Hydro Generation facility. The settlement provides recovery for increasing cost associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our JCP&L customers, along with the recovery of storm costs incurred over the past few years. It includes a $94 million annual increase in distribution revenues based on an ROE of 9.6%. The settlement also includes an agreement to delay the implementation of the rate increase until November 1, 2021, to assist our customers during the pandemic. Prior to then the rate increase will be offset through amortization of regulatory liabilities, totaling approximately $86 million beginning January 1. The parties also agreed that the net gains from the sale of JCP&L\u2019s interest in Yards Creek estimated at $110 million will be used to reduce the regulatory asset for previously deferred storm costs. We expect to close the Yards Creek transaction within the next few months. Finally, to continue our commitment to customer-focused transmission investments, we filed an application with FERC last week to move transmission assets in the Allegheny Power System zone to forward-looking formula rates. This includes transmission assets in the West Penn Power territory in Pennsylvania, the Mon Power territory in West Virginia, and the Potomac Edison territory in West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia. We are requesting an effective date of January 1, 2021. In addition, we created a new standalone transmission company, Keystone Appalachian Transmission Company, or KATCo to accommodate the new construction in this footprint. We filed last week to establish a forward-looking formula transmission rate for KATCo. And over the next several months, we plan to make the necessary filings to transfer certain transmission assets from West Penn Power and Potomac Edison to the new affiliate, requesting an effective date of January 1, 2022. In closing, while I find it disappointing that we have arrived at this point, I have great confidence, not only in the management team, but in the full support of the Board of Directors and together we are committed to lead this company out of it. I'd like to reiterate that our regulated growth strategy is strong. It is working and it is moving forward. And I am committed to working with management and the Board to address changes to our compliance program. Thank you for your time. And now, I'll turn it over to Jon Taylor for the financial review. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As always all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on our website. While we traditionally filed the 10-Q in connection with our call, we don't expect to file it this week as we continue our review and closing procedures to ensure we provide appropriate disclosure. Also, as we noted in Friday's 8-K, the violations of certain company policy and code of conduct by the terminated executives has caused us to reevaluate our controls framework and that could lead to identifying one or more material weaknesses. However, based on our review of these issues, we do not expect any impact to prior period financial results. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP and operating earnings of $0.84 per share. As Steve noted, operating earnings were $0.01 above the top-end of our earnings guidance range, largely reflecting the ongoing success of our regulated growth strategy, as well as benefits from weather. In the Distribution business, revenues increased compared to the third quarter of 2019 as a result of higher weather-adjusted residential usage and incremental rider revenue driven by our capital investment programs in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the third quarter of 2019 on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were approximately 21% above normal and relatively flat to the third quarter of 2019. Total residential sales increased 5.3% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to the same period last year, as many people continue to work-from-home and spend more time at home due to the pandemic. In the commercial customer class, sales decreased 5.5% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2019, and in our industrial class, third quarter load decreased to 6.3% compared to the same period last year. Consistent with the trends we've seen for the past 12 months, the only sector showing growth in our footprint was Shale Gas. As we discussed last quarter, the increased residential volumes more than offset the decrease in commercial, industrial load from a revenue perspective. In our transmission business, earnings were flat compared to the third quarter of 2019 as the earnings growth associated with our energizing the future transmission initiative were offset by higher net financing costs and the absence of a tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2019. And in our Corporate segment, our results primarily reflect higher tax benefits compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we will make our annual Pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments. Based on the asset returns through September 30 and the discount rate ranging from 2.7% to 3%, we estimate that adjustment to be between an after-tax loss of $330 million to a gain of $40 million. As a reminder, this is a non-cash item. Year-to-date, our return on assets is 9.2% versus our assumption of 7.5% and our funded status remains at 77%. As Chris mentioned, we proactively reached out to the three rating agencies last week to discuss within the leadership transition and our path forward. While we believe the fundamentals of our business remain strong, we understand there are certain management and governance factors that the agencies consider in their risk assessment, which ultimately impact the credit ratings. The rating agencies have taken numerous actions and we have provided all the details in the Investor Factbook. FE Corp remains at investment grade with both Fitch and Moody's. At S&P, while we are not investment grade at FE Corp or FirstEnergy transmission, all other subsidiaries remain investment grade at their issue-level ratings. We will continue to maintain our open dialogue with each of the agencies and remain in close contact with them as we chart our path forward. Finally, I'll take a few minutes to review other financial considerations and tactical changes we are making to address the uncertainty created by the investigations. First, from a liquidity perspective, I'll remind you that we continue to have access to $3.5 billion of credit facilities committed through December 2022. These facilities are substantially undrawn with only $150 million borrowed, and we remain in compliance with all covenants and can make the necessary representations and warranties to borrow new funds. In addition, we expect our holding company debt to remain around 35% of total adjusted debt, and we have no plans to increase debt at the FirstEnergy HoldCo. To further refine expectations for 2021, I want to make a few comments about the dividend and reaffirm our dividend policy. Two years ago at EEI, we announced a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of our operating earnings. In alignment with that policy, our Board raised the quarterly payout by $0.02 per share for dividends paid in 2019, and then by $0.01 per share for those paid in 2020. Given our current yield of approximately 5%, we expect to hold our quarterly dividend at $0.39 per share, or a $1.56 per share on an annualized basis for next year. This would represent a 59% payout ratio to our CAGR midpoint for 2021. The Board will continue to review the dividend on a quarterly basis. From a tactical perspective, our 2021 base O&M is flat to 2020 levels, and we\u2019ve soon began developing plans for reductions to operating expenses if necessary. With respect to our overall capital programs for 2021, our CapEx programs will be at the $3 billion level, and we will consider reductions if necessary. Equity continues to be a part of our overall financing plan. As Steve said, we are reaffirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023. And we will take the necessary actions financially to weather this uncertainty and put the company in the best position possible. We believe these steps are prudent to provide flexibility as we face uncertainty in the near-term.  Before we begin Q&A, I'll turn it back to Chris for a few more comments. Christopher Pappas : As we move towards questions and answers this morning, I want to summarize a few points. The investigation and matters related to it are ongoing, and therefore, we will not answer any questions related to this other than to refer to our earlier prepared remarks. I know you have many questions. We are not going to provide more information at this time. The Board and management view this as a serious and important matter, and our newly appointed subcommittee of the audit committee, led by Leslie Turner, as well as management and internal audit will address this immediately. FirstEnergy strategy is working and delivering results as shown in our third quarter 2020 results and our outlook going forward, but matters related to the investigation will add uncertainties to the future financial results of the company. The tactical financial changes that Jon described earlier are prudent to provide flexibility as we face uncertainty in the near-term. And now we'll open to questions and answers. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey. Good morning, guys. Steven Strah : Good morning, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza : Couple of questions here. First, does the Board intend on publicly releasing any of its findings while the federal investigations are going on and has the DOJ given you any sort of timeline on a potential resolution? Christopher Pappas : Hi. This is Chris Pappas. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, Chris. Christopher Pappas : Hi. No to both is the short answer. The investigation is ongoing and we will not be providing updates during that period, and we have no certainty on the timeline at this point from the DOJ. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then maybe just if you could from a balance sheet perspective, just touch on how you could expect to finance a potential fine or penalty? I know you have some equity cushion with your $1.2 billion in guidance for 2022 and 2023 and potentially higher corporate tax rates could help improve the cash flows. So what is sort of the balance sheet capacity look like if you went into a scenario where there could be a deferred prosecution agreement? Jon Taylor : Hey, Shar. This is Jon. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, Jon. Jon Taylor : I think that's why we're taking the steps that we're taking now to provide additional balance sheet flexibility. When we cut back CapEx, when we think about operating expense reductions, that doesn't necessarily max out your balance sheet over the next two years to fund that growth, in fact, it improves your balance sheet. So that's why we're taking the steps that we're taking to just kind of make sure that we address this uncertainty because we don't know where we're going to be in a year or so with the Department of Justice and whether or not there's going to be a fine or felony, so we're just slowing back on growth for the near-term. We can take additional actions if necessary, and I think that will provide plenty of balance sheet flexibility. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just lastly for me. Do you guys have any sort of current expectations around the fade of HB6? And it doesn't sound like \u2013 that sort of maybe impact your ability to provide 2021 guidance. And are you getting any sort of indication that the PUCO could maybe seek to reopen the current ESP, which runs through 2024? Steven Strah : Shar, this is Steve. The way we're viewing that is, the ESP and the distribution rate freeze that\u2019s in effect right now will continue through May of 2024. The way I look at it, if the PUCO would approach the company for some other different reason to open it, we would follow the lead of the regulator. That's really the way I would view it. As for House Bill 6, we're following along the progress and commentary, movements around the potential repeal of it. But right now we're just following along with the state legislature to see what they would like to do next. So Eileen anything to add? Jon Taylor : Shar, this is Jon. I would say that it depends on how \u2013 if it's a repeal and replace how they put in the decoupling mechanism, if they put it in at all. So I think there's a lot of unknowns, but if you remember going back to 2018, and then how we implemented decoupling this year, it wasn't, but about a $0.04 or $0.05 help to our earnings profile in the current year. So I think you got to keep that in consideration, when you think about these types of things. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And Steve, I wish it was under better circumstances, but really good luck on your transition. I think you are going to do great. So thanks guys. Steven Strah : Shar, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Steven Strah : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : I had just a process question. Has your internal committee been sharing all findings and documents with the DOJ and SEC as you've been kind of going through your process? Steven Strah : We\u2019ve been cooperating with both agencies, Stephen. Yes. The company has been cooperating with both agencies, right. Stephen Byrd : And Chris, are you confident that no other FirstEnergy officers or employees are in violation of FE policies or the code of conduct? Christopher Pappas : The investigation Stephen is still ongoing and it would be premature to make any comments on that till we get to a more conclusive state. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Have you received any other subpoenas? I think you mentioned the September\u2019s SEC subpoena. Have you received any other subpoenas from any federal or state entities recently? Christopher Pappas : No. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And have you uncovered any other violations that extend beyond the purview of the FBI investigation, for example, involving other states or interactions with PUCO? Christopher Pappas : It's really premature to comment again, Stephen. The dismissals of the employees that you've heard about last week are related to violations of the company's policies and code of conduct. And that's really all we can say at this time. Stephen Byrd : Yes. Understand. I know it's challenging for you to be able to address some of these questions. And do you have a sense over what timeframe you'll be sort of coming to your internal conclusions in terms of your investigation? Or is it timing unclear? Christopher Pappas : I think the timeline is unclear. What we can say is that the sub committee that we formed under the leadership of Leslie Turner will begin their work immediately on working on our own internal policies and compliance. And we'd expect some readout from them as the company reports its first quarter earnings. That's not around the investigation to be clear, that's around working on improving our policies around compliance. That's a parallel process, of course, the investigation. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Last one for me. Just on the Q, Jon, you mentioned potential for material weaknesses. Are there any particular sort of financial implications, financing implications or other implications if you do end up concluding that there are material weaknesses? Jon Taylor : I wouldn't think so. Like I said, based on everything that we've looked at, even if we conclude there is a material weakness, there wasn't any issue with the previous financial results that we've reported to our investor community. So, no, I wouldn't expect any issues like that. Stephen Byrd : Understood. I\u2019ll let others ask questions. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. I hope you all hanging in there. I wanted to just pick it up on the earning side of the equation here, if we can. Can you more [specifically] the puts and takes here in terms of the balance sheet latitude as well as the earnings trajectory outlook? Just so if I hear you right, for instance, it sounds like there's some costs levers, one. Two, it sounds like the decoupling piece could be about a dime from 250 to 260 give or take. And then third, I'm curious if there's anything else in terms of potential impacts. If you can address it from a credit ratings change on future financing assumptions you baked into the plan as well, if there's anything else? Christopher Pappas : Julien, that's a lot there. I mean, let me see if I can kind of address it. We're taking these steps to preserve balance sheet flexibility. I mean, we're in an uncertain period of time. This thing has to play out over a period of months maybe into next year. And we think it's just prudent to take these steps to cut back on some CapEx to maybe look at some operating expense reductions, so we can have some flexibility if something bad goes our way. I would say the decoupling mechanism is only about $0.04 or $0.05, not the $0.10 that you mentioned. So I think in the grand scheme of things, that would be something that we would overcome in a year. Steven Strah : Julien, this is Steve. I would just add. In my prepared comments, we talked about reaffirming our business plan and it's very strong and it's very robust in terms of confirming our CAGR for EPS through 2023, our plan remains unchanged at this point. I think what you're also seeing with our most recent quarter results, you're seeing the resiliency of that business plan that we've talked about before. So I think that speaks very strongly for our company and for the potential next few \u2013 the potential next year or two of some level of uncertainty here. We're not only sticking with that base business plan, but as we announced today, we are moving the Allegheny assets into formulaic rates from a transmission standpoint. And at that point, once that's concluded, you're going to see our transmission system 100% on formulaic rates moving ahead. So once again, it takes the strength that we have in our transmission program and even deepens it more. So that's the perspective that I would bring to it. Jon Taylor : And Julien, this is Jon. I think you had a question on just financing costs. As you think about the ratings that we have today, we are still investment grade with all the rating agencies except for S&P and that's at FirstEnergy HoldCo and then FirstEnergy Transmission. The majority of our financings over the next few years are going to be at our subsidiaries, which have investment grade credit rating. So I don't see that being too much of a challenge. We do have some holding company debt that comes due in 2022 and 2023, but we'll be able to manage through that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. That's what I was thinking. I was trying to reconcile those moving pieces here. If I can clarify even further, when you think about the preserving balance sheet flexibility, should we in fact update here in the next couple of quarters as far as explicit targets and what that means from an earnings perspective going forward? Obviously, this is somewhat fluid, but curious on how you would prepare to delineate it. Steven Strah : Right. I think we'll have more early next year when we talk about the fourth quarter results. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. Well, best of luck. Thank you very much. Christopher Pappas : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Our next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So I mean, I know we're trying to look forward, but I'm still processing the information that were provided during the second quarter earnings call. And I know that Chuck is no longer with the company. But I mean, can you help us maybe reconcile those statements with the attempts to rebuild credibility among investors? Yes. I\u2019ll leave it open ended like that. Christopher Pappas : Well, Angie, it's Chris. I think the only thing we can say is the internal investigation by the Board and outside counsel has led to the outcomes that you saw Friday. And that's really the only kind of comment we can make about that past and the dismissals of the executives mentioned were for violations of company policy and code of conduct. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then could you share with us if you have talked to your state regulators and what kind of feedback you have received following this news about management changes? Steven Strah : Angie, its Steve. We did do a comprehensive outreach not only to the state legislators, the regulators, state and local officials throughout our footprint. So I think if I was to characterize the outreach and the feedback, they were appreciative of our very prompt effort to talk to them and communicate the news. They were obviously various levels of surprise and shock if you will, of the actions that the Board took in a very decisive manner, but they understood once we talk them through that in general just like we are today. And there were concerns expressed, right. It was a significant change. It happened very quickly. And really \u2013 this is where we really have to lean on the relationships we have with the regulatory bodies. We've worked very, very hard over decades, at least a decades I\u2019ve been with the company to ensure that we have great two-way communication and give and take on various issues. And this is where you rely on those relationships. As acting CEO, I'm going to really make it a large part of my role to ensure that we can continue to communicate very closely with them, listen to concerns, respond appropriately and move ahead. It's like any other relationship in life. Its two way communication and I need to instill and promote that level of trust in FirstEnergy and I'm prepared to do that. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. And just last question, given how the stock is trading and given that you have equity needs even without this investigation or any potential penalties that might come out from that. Would you consider either asset sales or something else in lieu of straight up equity? Jon Taylor : Angie, this is Jon. I think we're taking these actions internally with CapEx reductions, OpEx reductions to give us flexibility including issuing equity. So I think those are the things that we're focused on first. And then we'll see where we are sometime down the road. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Steven Strah : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to follow-up a bit on some of the earlier conversation with Ohio. And if Ohio repeals or replaces House Bill 6 legislation, can you walk us through the exact impacts there? You guide to the top-end with no changes, but to the midpoint, if decouplings repeal, it sounds like half the drag is retroactive full-year decoupling removal. But what were the other kind of moving pieces there? If you could clarify a bit there that'd be great. Jon Taylor : So I think you would go back. The assumption would be, we would go back to the rate construct that we had in 2018. So you would remove the decoupling mechanism, but then you would reestablish your energy efficiency rider under the Rider DSE. So that would be the construct. So it would be about a $0.05 hit the earnings. And then you would no longer going forward depending on how they repealed and replaced, if decoupling was no longer part of the rate structure going forward, then you would have those \u2013 that mechanism, that Rider DSE in place going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. So I think you said $0.05 there. Just trying to figure out. I think you pointed to the top-end of the guide with HB6 and the midpoint without being kind of a $0.10 delta there. So just wondering what the remainder of that delta is I guess that drives the high-end versus the midpoint? Jon Taylor : Well, maybe I'll say it this way. Right now we think we're going to be near the top-end. If we hit the $0.05, or the House Bill 6 is repealed with the decoupling will be around the midpoint. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Okay. And then just one last one, if I could. And appreciate, this is a bit of an awkward question. But just wondering, Chris, well Steven is now the acting CEO, what are the next steps forward here on the CEO process? Christopher Pappas : I think it\u2019s a great question, Jeremy. Happy to answer. Steve has been clearly the candidate in our Board normal succession planning process for the CEO of the company. That's evidenced by his movement through the company, including his prior role as President. Due to the circumstances of what we experienced last week, the Board decided to move Steve immediately into the acting CEO role. And we would envision continuing on our succession plan, which is to at the right time in the near future have him assume the role of CEO. So in my view and the Board's view, we\u2019re on a normal transition to CEO with the person we always had in mind. Jeremy Tonet : That's a very helpful context. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Steven Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to make sure I clarify the tactical changes relative to your \u2013 the one tactical changes, you kept the dividend flat. And then I guess the other tactical changes are potential cost cuts and CapEx cuts. If those latter ones are made, would that change your plan meaningfully, or it's still kind of within the construct of the plan as reaffirmed? Jon Taylor : Steve. This is Jon. We would do that all in the construct of the plan we've been talking about. Steven Fleishman : Okay. That's helpful. I know you mentioned, there's no \u2013 if your credit ratings at the FE parent or I guess both S&P and Moody's downgraded below investment grade, there's no need for any triggers or any other related impacts for you? Steven Strah : No. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then on the credit line and facility, if you had these material weaknesses in your Q, that doesn't affect those facilities at all. Steven Strah : Let me let Steve Staub to take them. Steven Staub : Hey. This is Steve Staub. I'm the Treasurer of the company. So in the event that there would be any violations of any covenants under our credit facility, we would then at that point in time have to go and request a waiver from our bank group. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Eileen Mikkelsen : Steve, this is Eileen. I believe you said that Moody's downgraded us. Moody's affirmed our rating. Steven Fleishman : I guess I meant it both did. Yes, I'm aware of that. If both agencies did in the end. Is there? Christopher Pappas : So Steve, if both rating agencies downgraded us again, which means S&P\u2019s rating would go from BB plus down to BB and all of our utilities at that point would go down to non-investment grade and then the Moody's credit rating would go from Baa3 to Ba1. Our financing costs would obviously be a little more expensive. The holdco step-up provisions that we have with our bonds at the holding company, which applies to about $4 billion of them would obviously become a little more expensive because they would increase by about 50 basis points in terms of cost. Our credit facilities would become a little more expensive. That would increase strong pricing by 25 basis points. And we would have to post potentially up to about $40 million of collateral. It's all manageable. And I do want to say that, we have experienced at the BB plus credit rating right now with respect to S&P. S&P had us at that rating from 2010 through most of 2018. And so we are experienced at that current credit rating right now, and I wouldn't expect any issues accessing the capital markets if the ratings were lower, simply it would just be more \u2013 it would just be a little more expensive for us. Steven Fleishman : Great. That's very helpful. But it\u2019s not like the liquidity type events is just a little bit higher financing cost. Christopher Pappas : That is correct. I mean, we're fully regulated company now, so FES is no longer a part of FirstEnergy. And back then when it was a part of us, collateral requirements would have been much higher. Steven Fleishman : Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Well I have one clarification and then one quick follow-up. Just on the internal investigation, is that now over? I appreciate there's a subcommittee to look at sort of governance practices and improve them perhaps. But just \u2013 is the internal investigation now over at this point? Steven Strah : No, it is still ongoing as are the other investigations. Durgesh Chopra : Thanks for that clarification. And then just maybe one for Jon. Jon, we've done a discussion with investors around regulatory ROE versus GAAP ROE specifically in Ohio, maybe just \u2013 could you help us where you are with that \u2013 the differences, what drives the differences there and where is regulatory versus GAAP ROE perhaps at the end of Q3 or maybe even early in the year? Jon Taylor : Well, there's obviously several differences between how we report our financial results for GAAP and how we report them from a regulatory perspective. For instance, from a regulatory perspective in Ohio, you excluded the DMR when that was in place. There's other things that from a regulatory perspective that you exclude, for instance, in Ohio, you only get pension service costs as part of your race. So the non-service piece is excluded from the regulatory, which is typically a credit for us. So there are items like that that really drive the difference between what we report on a GAAP basis versus what we report on a regulatory basis. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And then maybe can you comment, and perhaps this is a follow-up with our \u2013 can you comment where you are in terms of that regulatory and ROE in Ohio? Jon Taylor : Well we filed the Ohio SEET for 2019, and we were 10.9%, 10.8% somewhere around there. So that's kind of where we are. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Much appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning. Steven Strah : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Just to sort of clarify your \u2013 it sounds like we may not get any \u2013 you guys aren't really planning on disclosing anything until \u2013 after the DOJ investigation is complete in public. Is that the way to think about this? Steven Strah : Yes. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then with respect to KATCo, could you remind us \u2013 I think that's going to begin in 2022 or that's what you guys have planned. Could you remind us what the earnings impact would be of that? Jon Taylor : Well, I think we're going to file for rates effective 1/1/2021, and then we would move those assets into that transmission company in 1/1/2022. If you look at the rate base, it's $750 million, somewhere around there. So at first, I don't think it's going to be as meaningful just because you're on a stated rate today and you're going to transition to a formula rate. But it is an area where investment is needed and it's an opportunity to improve the customer reliability in those service territories. And I think you'll start to see some CapEx going in there and then it could be meaningful. Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes, Jon. It\u2019s Eileen Mikkelsen, Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. I would just add to that. Once those forward-looking formula rates go into effect in 2021, we would expect that revenue to be really just about 1% higher than it would have been in the stated rate in that initial year. Steven Strah : Yes. And just to place it in the broader context, right now with \u2013 that really represents perhaps 10% of our transmission footprint. So it's not going to be large or significant, but once again, it completes the strategy that we have for transmission that is to move up the stated rates in the Allegheny footprint and go to formula. And as we preceded the JCP&L, we'll be successful there. We're confident. And this'll be the last progression. Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes. Interestingly, this is the last sort of large zone in PJM that is not on a formula rate, it\u2019s not an impressive stated rate. So time for the transition. Paul Patterson : Okay. I apologize for being a little off on this. But I think you guys are asking for 11.35% ROE. And you guys plan on getting that ROE being effective for $750 million worth of assets beginning in 2021. And if I understand that correctly, and I'm just sort of wondering what the ROE, I know it's different jurisdictions and stuff, but it's just what's the ROE in general that you guys have in those jurisdictions right now, roughly speaking? Eileen Mikkelsen : It's Eileen. And again, the ROE was part of a black box settlement that was established for the stated rates many years ago. So there is no stated ROE. What we did file for the forward-looking formula rate is the base ROE of 10.85%, and then the 50 basis point adder for RTO participation bringing that ROE up to 11.35% as filed. Paul Patterson : Okay. Well I'll follow-up afterwards. Thank you so much. Steven Strah : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one is probably for Jon, which is, I'm trying to think about the accounting of the JCP&L rate case. Can you walk us through the earnings impact of the rate increase versus the cash flow impact? I understand they're probably different given the amortization of the Reg S and Reg liability, but just \u2013 does the rate increase not really impact earnings next year, does it not really impact cash flow next year, or does it not impact both? Steven Strah : It does not impact cash flow next year, but it will impact earnings next year because you'll implement the base rate increase beginning January of 2021, but that will be offset by an amortization of a regulatory liability. So customers will not see the increase, but FirstEnergy will receive the earnings. Eileen Mikkelsen : It\u2019s Eileen. I would just add to that, that we will pick up two months, November and December of 2021 for base rate increase, there will be a little cash there. And the company as a condition of this settlement is able to retain the Yards Creek gain, which is an influx of [approximately, as you said earlier], $110 million expected in 2021. Michael Lapides : Got it. And if I think about it, the revenue increased just over $90 million. Are there costs that go up with it that will be offset on the income statement or that $94 million dropped to the bottom line? Jon Taylor : Yes. If you remember, part of our request was to collect a deferred storm costs. They adjusted storm costs that are included in the base rates. So there are costs associated with that rate increase. Michael Lapides : Got it. Can you just give us an inkling of how much of that been does drop to the bottom line? Jon Taylor : I think it\u2019s $0.04 to $0.05 a share. Michael Lapides : Meaning that's the benefit from the $94 million in rate increase? Jon Taylor : That's correct. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jon. Much appreciated. Last, any \u2013 and this maybe a Steve question. Any thoughts at all about generation transformation, meaning transforming the fleet in West Virginia going forward, just curious given that's the one place you own generation, and it's obviously a coal heavy fleet in West Virginia. Just curious given the declining costs of gas fire generation as well as obviously solar and wind. How you're thinking about what your fleet looks like three to five years from now there? Steven Strah : Well, right now, we're working towards publishing \u2013 not publishing, but submitting our IRP for West Virginia. So within that document, we're going to articulate some of our moving forward thoughts for West Virginia. You are right. It is a coal fleet there for us. And we're very cognizant of our responsibilities to run those plants. However, as you look forward, there is an opportunity for example, to be able to install solar within the state right now and we're also considering that. So more on that later, we're due to submit that filing in December of this year. Correct, Eileen? Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Thanks for taking my questions. Steven Strah : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Paul Fremont : Thanks. I guess the first question I have is just to get a better understanding of the 5% to 7% growth through 2023, which I thought had been in part at least linked to your rate base growth. In terms of \u2013 if you end up cutting back on CapEx and you have less rate base, would you be making that up then through O&M reduction or can you just explain how you would be able to maintain the 5% to7%? Jon Taylor : I think there's a lot of different moving pieces. Cost containment would obviously be one thing that we could do, and we already have seen some favorable impacts in our forecast from the favorable returns we had last year in our pension. So that's going to flow through. If you think about where interest rates are today versus where they were when we confirmed our CAGR last year, borrowing costs are down. We had a very successful bond deal at FE Corp earlier this year. So they're all factors that are driving our confidence in that number. Now, there is some uncertainty that we have to deal with, and that's why we're taking these steps to kind of provide for some flexibility. If something doesn't go our way, but just because we're cutting back CapEx, $250 million is not going to throw us off track to hit those results. Steven Strah : And just as a reminder, that's $250 million roughly on a budget within our plan that we were counting on to be $3 billion to $3.25 billion. So once again, it's prudent to do the planning right now and it's a small portion of a much larger pie that helps fuel our transmission earnings power. And by the way, just to emphasize it, as we've said before, very important for customers; two, we're seeing significant reliability improvements within those investments. So it's dual, right. Customers are seeing benefit, and it is a very good earnings engine for the company appropriately. Paul Fremont : Next question would be on the second quarter call, you had indicated that you would not seek to alter a potential rating agency downgrade to sub investment grade because you expected to be vindicated as part of the investigation. Are you now comfortable to remain sub investment grade with at least one rating agency? Steven Strah : No. We're not comfortable with that. I mean \u2013 but at the end of the day, it's related to governance issues and I think that's why we're taking the steps that we're doing to address the governance matters, the compliance matters with Leslie's subcommittee, and that'll be part of what they focus on. Paul Fremont : So your expectation would then be once you put additional governance measures into place, that the rating agency would then reverse the downgrade action? Steven Strah : I mean, we would have to talk to them about the steps that we're taking, the findings we found, the recommendations. I think it's going to take some time for us to work through this. But our focus is going to be improving on those types of matters, so we can get the rating back to investment grade. Paul Fremont : So you would not take action to issue equity to try and bring the rating back up. Steven Strah : No. Paul Fremont : Great. Steven Strah : Okay. Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed. Charles Fishman : Thank you. With KATCo, as I recall with ATSI and MAIT, and as part of the energizing of the future, there was such an incredible opportunity for investment because of preferred investment, really with the things going on at FES, balance sheet and everything else five, 10 years ago. Is there that same opportunity at KATCo once we get beyond 2023 and assuming the forward rate making goes into effect? Would you envision the investment accelerating at that transmission co? Steven Strah : I think there is significant opportunity in KATCo and that's exactly why we made our filing. I think it also provides additional flexibility for our company to move. Let's just say that $3 billion transmission spend around our system. So once again, while under a stated rate, we believed our strategy would be better suited to go after investments in other formulaic rates around our system. When you look at the reliability of the transmission system in general, we found greater needs at ATSI and MAIT, rather than pursuing anything in Allegheny in the early going of the energizing the future program. It's very difficult to believe, but we're entering I believe here seven of that program. So we've seen reliability improvements in both of the other transmission companies. We are certainly not done yet. I believe we have a pipeline of 20 years worth of work that we've fixed a $20 billion number too in terms of a potential additional transmission upgrades. So to your earlier point, what I would call a pent-up need there, and we're responsibly addressing it. Charles Fishman : That's helpful. Thank you. That's all I have. Steven Strah : Thank you. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Yes. Operator : Go ahead. Please proceed. Steven Strah : Okay. Thank you very much. I just wanted to close out the call by thanking you for your time and attention today and the interest in our company. And I know that we did our very best today to provide you a fulsome update on recent key events. We also look forward to talking and meeting with each of you in the Virtual EEI Conference coming up. So look forward to that very much. I would also just close with a message of safety. The pandemic that is still very much alive in this country. As a company, we\u2019re working very hard to keep our employees safe and our customers safe. I just wish all the best to each one of you is as we maintain the right safety protocols while we\u2019re working through it. So all the best to you and be safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation that supports today\u2019s discussion and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the strategic and financial highlights documents on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website. Participants in today\u2019s call include our President and Acting Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Executive Director and Independent Board Member, Chris Pappas. We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Strah : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I wanted to kickoff the call with a few words on a critical area of focus for FirstEnergy. Taking appropriate action to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity. We are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic and second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders. This focus is absolutely essential for our success as an organization. Our commitment starts at the top and extends throughout the organization. We are working to ensure that every leader is actively engaged in setting the proper tone and creating an environment where not only our words, but our actions align with our core values and behaviors. We're building a world-class compliance function to underpin this effort, including bringing on Hyun Park as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer in January. Hyun is the right person to step into this role at this time and he will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift. We will also be appointing a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer who will manage a dedicated team of compliance professionals and enhance our efforts to improve our compliance function by shifting from a decentralized to a more centralized model. In addition, we'll be designated compliance ambassadors throughout the company to act as boots on the ground. Ensuring the entire organization understands the critical importance of compliance and what it means for each individual. We are also making significant changes in our approach to political and legislative engagement and advocacy. Our activity in this space will be much more limited than it has been in the past with closer alignment to our strategic goals and with additional oversight and significantly more robust disclosure. With this additional transparency my goal is to make it crystal clear exactly what efforts we support. These efforts together with enhanced policies and procedures will help to bring additional clarity around appropriate behaviors at FirstEnergy and through enhanced communications, training and most importantly our actions. We are dedicated to re-emphasizing that every employee at every level has the responsibility to consistently act in accordance with our core values and behaviors and to speak up if they see inappropriate behavior anywhere in the organization. At the same time we're taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and brand and focus on the future. This includes the decisions recently made with respect to Ohio that I'll talk about shortly. And while we don't control the timeline related to the DOJ and SEC we will continue to cooperate fully with these government investigations and remain focused on the matters that we can control. Chris will address a number of actions the Board has underway in a more detailed manner later in this call. But be assured that both management and the board will be relentless and take the steps needed to position our company for long-term success. Now turning to earnings today we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share. On Tuesday, we announced several proactive steps we're taking to resolve a range of regulatory proceedings affecting our Ohio utilities. These include our previously announced agreement with the Ohio Attorney General along with a decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues. This resulted in a charge of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Absent this charge our 2020 operating earnings would have been $2.54 per share well above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range and reflective of our strong performance last year. While this was a difficult decision, we are confident it was the right decision. We believe resolving these matters in a comprehensive manner is a critical step to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and integrity in every aspect of our business while taking steps toward removing uncertainty relating to our current Ohio regulatory matters. And in the interest of providing additional transparency today's investor materials will include more information about regulatory ROEs in each of the states we serve. We remain excited about the significant investment opportunities that will continue to drive solid earnings and growth in the years ahead. When we have further clarity in Ohio and with the ongoing government investigations we intend to resume providing a long-term growth rate that should be consistent with traditional utility growth rates and similar to what we have provided in the past. For now, we are focusing on this year and we have introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We have made these disclosures early so you would have time to absorb them before this call, because we have a lot of ground to cover today including our solid operational performance last year even in the face of the pandemic. Our strategy for 2021 and beyond including our commitment to building shareholder value and the work we're doing to position the company for the future. Our fundamental performance continues to be excellent. We continued making demonstrable progress on our strategic goals and we had an exceptional year from a safety perspective. Even with about half of our employees working from home and the others adopting new health and safety protocols, the FirstEnergy team has remained laser focused on providing safe and reliable service to our 6 million customers. I am deeply proud of the team's resilience and commitment, especially in light of the turbulence that marked the year. Our results in 2020 reflect our commitment to strong operations as well as the stability provided by our diverse footprint and our wires focused platform. Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission system as we continued our reliability in grid mod program to benefit customers. We believe a robust long-term organic growth opportunities are well aligned with the focus on electrification and the critical role the grid plays in supporting the transition to a carbon neutral economy. These opportunities and our goals that support them are included in our strategic plan published last month and available on our website. I hope you have taken some time to review it. This updated plan addresses our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability and identifies bold goals for key areas of our business. These goals are aligned with our core values and behaviors, our regulatory strategy and our commitments to our customers, communities and investors as well as the environmental stewardship. Among these objectives outlined in the plan is our pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This ambitious goal reflects our transformation to a regulated electric utility and our responsibility to help create a sustainable energy future. The strategic plan also addresses our continued commitment to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We've had a D&I focused KPI for three years now and we are taking even more aggressive steps to make progress in this area. We're excited to pursue a 30% increase in our number of racially and ethnically underrepresented employees by 2025 both overall and at the supervisor and above level. We believe this will help accelerate our transformation into an innovative, diverse and sustainable company and drive an important shift in our corporate culture. We recently completed our fourth company-wide survey of all employees. Overall, I'm proud to say we scored relatively well on many fronts, but we certainly have more work to do. One area identified for improvement is listening and valuing the opinions of our employees. We want employees to feel empowered to voice their opinion on important issues and my team with guidance and support from the board of directors is addressing this head on. We view this work is central to strengthening our compliance program and a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability. I'd like to explain my approach to driving this change and perhaps we can use the company's safety culture as an analogy. Several years ago, we had concerns that our safety culture was trending in the wrong direction. Management led a significant effort with our employees to put in place new programs and training and to consistently demonstrate that safety is and will always be an unwavering core value. These efforts ultimately instituted a cultural shift in how we all understood the critical importance of safety. We want that very same cultural shift to occur as it relates to compliance and ethics and we want our employees to know that we value and welcome their opinions. As we look ahead, I feel confident in our path forward. We have a strong foundation. Our fundamentals are solid and our strategies are proven. And we are building on that with the relentless focus on making FirstEnergy a better company as we work to rebuild trust, work to achieve financial results and deliver for our customers and investors. We recognize the changes won't happen overnight. They happen over time just like the evolution in our safety culture I spoke about earlier. I'm confident we will emerge a stronger, better FirstEnergy. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris Pappas who can address the specific and significant actions that the board and management are taking to address the current challenges and set FirstEnergy on the right path for a successful future. Christopher Pappas : Thank you, Steve. First, I'd like to reiterate the board's strong support of Steve and recognize the hard work he and the rest of the team are doing. We commend their willingness to learn from the past and their absolute commitment to take this company forward on a new path all while executing the company's strategy and keeping operations and financial results on solid footing. The board and management team are focused on a critical objective to move forward from the past actions of certain former executives and to take the steps necessary to improve the tone at the top, culture of ethics and integrity and the way we do business. Steve talked about a lot of the important work that is being driven by the new management team. Likewise the board is committed to strengthening every part of FirstEnergy\u2019s culture and taking the necessary steps to reestablish credibility. Together, we have made much progress on the issues that confronted the company several months ago. And at the same time we recognized there is more work to do. I'd like to recap some of the steps that the board has been actively engaged in to drive improvements in our culture of compliance. First the board promptly put in place an independent committee with external counsel to oversee the internal investigation and to monitor the status of the various regulatory and legal matters facing the company. The independent committee which currently is made up of the entire board meets frequently and regularly. The board acted swiftly in removal of five executives, name Steve Straw as acting CEO, establish an Executive Director role and expanded the role of the board chair. All to assist management and the board with the dynamics we faced in the first months of the investigation. The board unequivocally endorsed the principle of full cooperation with both the DOJ and the SEC on the matters related to the investigation. And through our own internal investigation led by independent counsel has supported intensive analysis. The board established a compliance oversight subcommittee of the audit committee with independent counsel and leading compliance advisors to analyze and improve the compliance policy and culture at FirstEnergy. Steve mentioned some initial output from this work earlier. In addition the board established a number of working groups to oversee and support various work streams including communications, recruiting and financial flexibility. And to that point, management has initiated a project called FirstEnergy forward a transformational effort to change the way the company does business. The objective of this project is to transform the company for the future, but it will also provide near-term financial flexibility. Jon will discuss this later on the call. We know there is particular interest in the status of the internal investigation. Hopefully, my earlier comments give you a sense of the intensity and the magnitude of the work that has occurred within the company and with the benefit of extensive external independent support. Our internal investigation continues to be thorough and robust and includes assistance from external law firms who are supported by several other consultants. The ongoing investigation has not resulted in any new material items not previously disclosed. In the course of the internal investigation, we did identify certain transactions, which in some instances extended back 10 years or more, including vendor services that were either improperly classified, misallocated to certain of utility or transmission companies or lacked proper supporting documentation. These transactions resulted in amounts collected from customers that were immaterial to FirstEnergy and our utility and transmission companies will be working with the appropriate regulatory agencies to address these amounts. Our internal investigation will also continue to address any due developments in connection with the ongoing DOJ and SEC investigations. More importantly, we are increasing our focus on another critical aspect of our work moving FirstEnergy forward. The fresh perspective of Hyun Park and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer will be invaluable to creating an environment where the entire team is committed to embracing the right behaviors and embedding a strong culture of compliance. To further that effort, we also announced this morning that we have hired John Somerhalder as Vice Chairman of the Board. It is my pleasure to welcome John to the board in his new role. He will also join the executive team on a transitional basis as executive director and act in advisory capacity to support efforts to achieve the company's priorities, restore its reputation and strengthen its overall governance and compliance functions. John is a 40-year industry executive with extensive energy experience in navigating complex challenges and driving strong corporate governance. Bringing John into this full time role means that I will step back from the executive director position, I've held since October and return to my regular duties as an independent board member by April 1. And importantly, we will continue to fully support the management team as it transitions FirstEnergy to the future as a more resilient company. Despite the challenges, the company has faced, FirstEnergy\u2019s operating fundamentals are strong and we have a great platform of assets. Together, we have put in place a robust plan to move forward and to position FirstEnergy as an industry leader; one we know it can be and one that we\u2019ll deliver excellent value to its customers and shareholders. We look forward to working together alongside with management in this effort. Now we'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor for a financial update. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019ll review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters. This morning we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share with operating earnings of $0.32 per share. Our operating results include the charge at our Ohio utilities as Steve mentioned earlier absent this charge our results reflect continued rate based growth related to our transmission and distribution investment programs a favorable mix of customer usage reflecting the impact of our residential customers staying at home and higher expenses mostly associated with the pandemic. Additional fourth quarter data is available in the supporting materials on our website. So in light of our lengthy agenda for this call I'm going to focus on our results for the full year of 2020. As Steve mentioned we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of a $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share which compared to 2019 GAAP results of a $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.55 per share. In our distribution business in addition to the $0.15 charge at our Ohio utilities results for 2020 as compared to 2019 reflect the absence of rider DMR in Ohio which was in place for the first half of 2019 and higher operating costs. These were partially offset by higher revenues from increased residential usage as well as earnings from our distribution enhancement programs. Although total weather adjusted sales decreased 2% in 2020. Normal usage from our residential customers increased 5% for the year, which from an earnings perspective more than offset the 6% decrease in commercial and industrial load. While this shift has moderated as a pandemic wears on, we have seen higher weather adjusted residential usage relative to our latest forecast in the 2% to 4% range with flat to slightly higher CNI usage. In our transmission business, approximately $550 million in rate base growth drove stronger results which were partially offset by higher financing costs. The impact of transmission rate true ups in the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2019. And finally at our corporate segment full year 2020 results primarily reflect higher corporate expenses, higher interest costs and a lower consolidated tax rate. Today, we are providing 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and first quarter operating earnings guidance in the range of $0.62 to $0.72 per share. Our expectations for the year include capital investments of up to $3 billion with 100% of the $1.2 billion in transmission investment and approximately 40% of the $1.7 billion in distribution investment being recovered in a formula rate. Our transmission plan includes continue expansion of our Energizing the Future program. In New Jersey, we filed an uncontested settlement agreement with FERC on February 2 in our forward-looking formula rate case. In New Jersey, we found an uncontested settlement agreement with FERC on February 2 in our forward-looking formula rate case. In December, FERC accepted our proposed tariff revisions for the transmission assets of West Penn Power, Mon Power and Potomac Edison as well as the new Keystone Appalachian Transmission Company known as KATCO pending the outcome of this settlement and hearing process. Those entities moved to a forward looking formula rate structure effective January 1st of this year, subject to refund. Other key drivers for 2021 include the impact from the base distribution case at JCP&L, continued investment in our distribution enhancement programs and lower operating costs. We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher interest expense, which includes close to $0.04 per share associated with the step up on $4 billion of holding company bonds and $0.05 per share associated with our revolver borrowings that I'll address in a moment. Additionally, our load forecast has a more typical usage profile for our residential customers and a slower recovery to pre-pandemic levels for our CNI customers. Equity remains a part of our overall financing plan and we are affirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023 and we will flex these plans as needed. We remain committed to maintaining adequate liquidity for our distribution and transmission subsidiaries. At year end, our liquidity was approximately $3 billion with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of undrawn capacity under our credit facilities. We currently have $2.2 billion of short-term borrowings of which approximately $2.1 billion was incurred in November as a proactive measure to increase our cash position to preserve financial flexibility. And we have committed to our bank group that as we work through our financing plan we expect to reduce short-term borrowings with the timing and amount depending on a number of factors. Our current maturities of long-term debt remain manageable with only $74 million maturing in 2021. We remain in close contact with the rating agencies who are intensely focused on governance and the actions we are taken to strengthen our compliance environment and controls, improving our credit metrics at FirstEnergy while committed \u2013 committing to return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintaining the strong credit ratings that our utilities are key priorities. We are targeting future FFO to debt metrics in the 12% to 13% range at the consolidated level as we work to address some of the uncertainties that Chris and Steve mentioned. We know how important the dividend continues to be for our investors. In accordance with our target payout ratio of 55% to 65% the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 in December payable March 1. And as we mentioned on our third quarter call, our intent is to hold the 2021 dividend flat to the 2020 level of $1.56 per share subject to ongoing board review and approval. The board will obviously need to consider the entire landscape of the investigation process before each quarterly dividend is declared. Finally, Chris mentioned that we kicked off a project ETI4 that I see transforming FirstEnergy into a more efficient and effective industry leader delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns, in partnership with McKinsey employees across FirstEnergy our challenging organizational traditions, conventional wisdom and cultural norms. At the same time, we are focused on modernizing our management practices processes in digital and technology platforms to deliver a superior customer experience and a much more nimble organization for the future. While we view this as a transformational effort, we expect to naturally deliver efficiencies that will help us address whatever comes on our way in the future while meeting all of our regulatory commitments. Beyond these benefits we expect that this transformation will provide us the ability to reinvest in our business, our customers and our employees to become a better technology enabled leader in the industry, committed to innovation, investments in emerging technologies and to support a smarter and cleaner electric grid. While this project is not the only step in our journey, it's a critical one. The eight week information gathering phase of the project included intense and robust employee engagement to better understand how we work and how we can do it better through the use of more modern technology, digital and mobility tools and the use of data and analytics. As we enter into the next phase of this effort we will again engage employees throughout the company to review and assess each opportunity and build out the plans to transform FirstEnergy. Over the next few months, we will build out specific actions for the future which we look forward to sharing. Christopher Pappas : Before we open up the call to Q&A, we wanted to provide a recent update which we disclosed in our 10-K this morning. We received a letter dated February 16 2021 from Icahn Capital informing the company that Carl Icahn is making a filing under the Hart Scott Rodino Act and has an intention to acquire voting securities of FirstEnergy an amount exceeding $184 million but less than $920 million depending on various factors including market conditions. We do not know whether Carl Icahn and his affiliates have acquired shares of FirstEnergy common stock and/or derivatives and we do not know his intentions with respect to our company. The letter represents our only contact with Icon Capital and we don\u2019t have any additional information to share. With that, we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : It's actually James for Shahriar. So just on FE 4, if we could start off about that last point, can you give us any color on maybe the size of the scope and some of the potential efficiencies that you're trying to identify especially sort of kind of coming off with FE small still lot to stake? Jon Taylor : Yes, that's correct James. And as I mentioned we view this as a as a transformational effort. And if you think about our company, we've not had a lot of investment in the technology areas. In fact I think we've kind of starved that area to a certain extent. And for instance modern investments around mobility, use of data and analytics that we see could drive a lot of value for the company. In some instance, I would tell you that we're operating on late 1990s and early 2000 vintage platforms. And so, we see a lot of opportunity for efficiency in fact, integration of systems, digital tools to drive efficiencies, use of automation and data analytics around asset health, maintenance work, whether it be repair, replace decisions vegetation management programs, procurement and so we're excited about the opportunity. We just finished phase 1 of the project and I think our employees are very excited. I think they see this as a real opportunity. And the amount of opportunity was meaningful enough to go into phase 2. And so, we'll be building out the blueprints in phase 2 and then as we make progress will continue to provide updates. Steven Strah : Yes, I would just add Jon I think that's a great run down. From my perspective, this project is not only looking at the ability to promote greater financial flexibility, but I think it's a real prime time opportunity for us now that we're a fully regulated electric utility to keep the customer in the middle of our focus also. And I think this project will represent opportunities just as Jon outlined to keep the customer in the middle of the mission and improve customer service ultimately. Unidentified Analyst : And then I guess just turning to the 2021 guide, the flexibility in the CapEx program, can you just provide a little bit more detail on where that is? And if you wind up flexing it because what is the plan to revisit that foregone spend in future years would primarily be in 2022 that - just a function of financing it any color there? Jon Taylor : I think we have flexibility in most all of our programs. I mean you think about it $3 billion across 13 utility and transmission companies there's obviously opportunities across the spectrum. And so, I think it's kind of a wait and see mode, but I do think there are some opportunities for us to be more efficient. And if we need to scale back we can do that, but that's something that will address down the line. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And I guess where should, we expect to start standing up new projects in KATCo? Jon Taylor : I think as early as this year. I mean we're spending some money this year in KATCo or excuse me, not KATCo, but the territory West Penn, Mon Power and Potomac Edison that's where we're spending the money. But I think KATCo would probably be a little bit further down the line. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Steven Fleishman : So first of all, could you just repeat the comments that you just made regarding this Icahn letter that you received? Jon Taylor : Oh yes. We received the letter from Icahn. It was dated February 16. It expressed his intentions to buy securities of FirstEnergy and that's pretty much all we know at this point time. Steven Strah : Yes, Steve, we thought it was noteworthy and that's why we're just being open and transparent about it, can't really comment as Jon said, we just don't know enough at this point. But look we just reviewed many very good actions that the Board and management have taken together. As we work as a team completely through our current challenges and we're just going to continue to do the right thing in open and transparent way and that's going to be to the benefit of all shareholders. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Second question is the things that you found about these transactions that were improperly classified but were immaterial. Was there certain kind of - types of transactions here that were improperly classified? So are these like a lot related to let's say like lobbying or government affairs or is it a whole bunch of different things? Christopher Pappas : Hi, Steve hi, it's Chris Pappas. So we found as noted in the comments a relatively small amount of variety of transactions, over a long period of time, we mentioned up to 10 years and in some cases beyond. So the context for this that I think is important is we have taken an extensive deep analysis of all kinds of transactions in the company that includes the zones you're describing, it could be lobbying political, it could be contracts with vendors a whole variety of things. And in that process we identified some transactions that were improperly characterized, allocated, not supported, small amounts, not material and those amounts will now be in discussion with the jurisdictions where they occurred through a regulatory group. And they will be managed going forward through that process. So I want to leave you with one impression a lot of work an extensive amount of deep analysis and a limited amount of findings as a result of that essentially in the arenas that I described. Steven Fleishman : Okay. But you can't characterize kind of the type of whether these were all kind of similar type things? Christopher Pappas : No - well, they range from what I described. They could be a vendor payment that was inappropriately allocated. They could be - a lobbying effort that was inappropriately allocated. There are a whole variety of small items like that. It's not focused in one area or otherwise. And these are small items over a long period of time that will need to be corrected. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then lastly just the - release you put out two days ago there was besides some offering to not charge for the energy efficiency recovery. You also basically kind of gave an olive branch so to speak to all parties to try to have discussions on all the various regulatory issues in Ohio that are pending. Do you have any sense of reaction to that and/or any sense that other parties are interested in negotiating with you right now? Steven Strah : Yes, Steve I would just say in general we're taking a new and fresh approach to Ohio. It's one of collaboration in creating a more constructive environment. And it's really around listening and learning in terms of not only the regulators views but all of our stakeholders. And the first step was to forego the lost distribution revenue issue. It was consistent with the partial settlement that we arrived at with the Ohio Attorney General and we felt as though it was the right thing to do. And this idea of taking the known items that are on our collective agenda in Ohio and bundling them together in a collaborative process is really what we're aiming at here. And I'm going to turn it over to Eileen Mikkelsen to give us a sense of a dialogue that we have heard at a very high level and then any other color commentary if you will you'd like to lend. Eileen Mikkelsen : Thanks Steve, good morning, everyone. It's Eileen Mikkelsen and I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. As Steve mentioned, we have begun the process of outreach to various regulatory stakeholders in the state of Ohio trying to express to them our interest in moving forward in a clear transparent cohesive fashion, but also taking time to listen, listen to what is important to the various regulatory stakeholders and using that listening exercise to collectively craft a solution that will move us forward for our customers and for the state of Ohio as well as the company. In terms of early returns, I think folks are very interested in moving forward with this process. As you might expect their enthusiasm is tempered a bit by let's wait and see. We have to put our money where our mouth is in terms of our ability to listen and work collectively with these people. And we're willing to run the gates to do that in order to gain the trust and support of the stakeholders in order to move us forward in the regulatory process here in Ohio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So perhaps let me try and clarity couple of points from the last couple questions here. So first, can you try to summarize what's reflecting your 2021 guidance with respect to the cost cutting efforts that you just alluded to? And I know that transitory, but I just want to understand in 2021 and what that means for 2022 because obviously there is cost cutting, there is potentially paying down the revolver here. And then also more holistically how do you think about balance sheet improvement here when you talk about flexibility et cetera? What can we expect to overall latitude in the form of the balance sheet for whatever we may have? Jon Taylor : So Julien this is Jon. So I would tell you that we don't have anything in the current plan related to FE forward. We view this more as a transformational effort that's going to take some time. It could take two to three years. There could be some opportunities for some quick wins. But we don't have anything currently baked into our 2021 plan. There could be a little bit of upside. I'm not going to commit to that right now. But as we work through the next phase of this project we will see if there is opportunity to accelerate some of the opportunities or we just let it flow naturally through the course of the program. But again I don't view this as a cost cutting exercise. I view this more of a transformational effort that's really focused on creating efficiencies for the long-term. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And then on the balance sheet, how would you describe the - your creating padding if you will through this and other efforts? Jon Taylor : Well I mean I think as you know if we are able to create efficiencies through the P&L obviously that's credit positive. So, we can look for those types of opportunities. It might scale back some of the CapEx in terms of being more efficient in the work we do, but at the end of the day, the plan is going to be to reinvest some of those dollars into our customers, our employees and for emerging technology type of investments and to support kind of a renewable type of grid. And so, it's not going to be dollar for dollar efficiencies. It's going to be efficiencies used to reinvest in our business whether that be employees or customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Understood Excellent. If I can just jump in and clarify the last response [technical difficulty] out there right now. How do you think about bringing stakeholders together to get some resolution. I mean obviously you've got to deal with each one of these, but could there be something more comprehensive and if so what would that look like. Again, I'm not presuming that there is. Irene Prezelj : It's Irene and thanks for the question. I think what we intend to do is you're right there are a number of open proceedings in Ohio, but as I mentioned earlier, what we intend to do is the first step in this process is really listen, listen to the various stakeholders to understand what their interest is, what their concerns if any are with respect to the regulatory construct. And I would say that includes open proceedings, but it includes whatever is of interest to the regulatory stakeholders. We want to sweep all of that into one big process. I will say it is not our intention to step away from or interrupt any of the work that's currently going on from the commission proceedings whether it's the show cause proceeding or the corporate separation proceeding or the audit of DMR. We expect that work to continue. We will fully participate and cooperate in that work. But on a parallel path, we want to be working with all these parties to understand what's important to them and what we can do collectively to move this issue forward in the state of Ohio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Durgesh Chopra : Jon, first one for you, just going back to the balance sheet, just can you quantify your FFO to debt as of 2020 this past year and what does it look like in 2021 under your current plan? Jon Taylor : So I think we were around 10% at the end of 2020 if I got credit for the cash that we had on the balance sheet. I think we're going to be a little bit north of that this year. But that's going to improve over time as we issue the equity as we look to implement FE forward and so we're targeting sometime once we get through some of these uncertainties in the 12% to 13% range. That is our target for our go forward plan. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. So 2020 plus is when you expect to be in that 12% to 13% range, understood. Okay. And maybe just anything you may not be able to comment on this, but just can you give us any more color on that under federal investigation process. Where does that stand? Are you exchanging information or answering that question? Just any other color would be appreciated? Thank you. Steven Strah : Well, this is Steve. Oh I'm sorry. Go ahead, Chris. Christopher Pappas : Okay. Steve, you need to follow-up. Steven Strah : Sure. Christopher Pappas : So the short answer is we're still cooperating. Look we have taken the approach from the beginning that cooperating with both the DOJ and the SEC and in full cooperation is the right approach. We have done a number of things to support that and we'll continue to do that. Otherwise we really can't comment any further. I would however say that the cooperation is just one of the cornerstones of the shift and change in this company that Steve and others are driving. And I hope you're getting that impression more broadly not just around the cooperation, but more broadly around the dynamics of compliance improvement, the activities of the board, the bringing on of a new executive director and vice chair with extensive experience in the energy and utility space. John Somerhalder who will be a great add, the bringing on of Hume Park, the eventual onboarding of a new compliance and ethics officer, the changes that the company is making and its compliance and ethics program as part of the work of the subcommittee of the audit committee. All of these things in concert are moving the company forward in a way that FirstEnergy is going to emerge from this as we think stronger and different and better company. So I'd like you to keep all that in mind as you guys think about the dynamics going on there. Steve go ahead. Steven Strah : Chris, I think really you summarized it very well there. So, I can speak in particularly for the management team, we\u2019re very excited to bring Jon on with his deep and long experience and we\u2019re just really very excited to get started. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. And certainly we do appreciate and thanks for the added disclosure in the appendix. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to pick up with the discovered deficiencies, and could you provide which states these materialized in if they're outside Ohio as well as and do you expect these findings to represent the full extent of important deficiencies here or could there still be more? Christopher Pappas : Hi, Jeremy, Chris. So look as we said extensive deep long work long time frame work small amounts, the majority of it is in Ohio but there are small amounts in other states. All of those will be addressed by Eileen and her team. We believe in a constructive manner with those jurisdictions. They're very small amounts. We don't expect them to have an impact on the company. Jeremy Tonet : And I was just wondering if you might be able to provide any more kind of early feedback you've gotten on some of the recent steps you've taken here. It seems like quite comprehensive overall. Do you think these are enough to mitigate concerns over internal practices while we wait for the resolution of the investigations here and have the agencies giving you any feedback on these recent measures? Steven Strah : Well, all I can say is we're in touch with the agencies regularly and Agency regularly and we are continuing our work. We have done a lot of work and we'll continue our work. I'm not going to predict timing or outcome of either our internal continued work or the course of federal work. But yes, to your question are we working with them closely on these activities, of course. Jon Taylor : So Jeremy this is Jon. I had a little bit of color there. So, we've been meeting with the agencies every month for the past and I'm talking about the rating agencies for the past several months. I think the meetings have been very productive. We\u2019ve had Chris on the call a couple of different times, their focus is on governance compliance and we've been providing them updates as we make progress. I think the meetings have been very constructive and I feel although they're positive meetings, but I think they're still in kind of a wait and see mode. And I think they want to see the changes in action before they consider any type of ratings change or outlook change and I think they also want to see how this investigation plays out. So, we're going to continue to meet with them on a regular basis and update them on our progress. But I think so far the meetings have been very constructive, have been very open and very transparent. Jeremy Tonet : And any other early feedback from other stakeholders in response to actions you\u2019re taking here. Steven Strah : I think in general if you would look at the regulators that we have approached there is a thankfulness by them relative to us reaching out in a very transparent manner on issues of interest. So, once again, we as a company are going to continue to take what I would call a no surprises approach and I think that's being received very, very well. I think as Chris had talked through in his prepared remarks, the board has taken comprehensive and decisive action in a number of different ways. And I think from the various stakeholders that we've been in touch with the feedback certainly has been very good. There is a difference however between talking about creating change and then being that change. And that's exactly what we're in the process converting words into action and there will be more. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Fremont : I wanted to focus on a change in language between the current 10-K and the last 10-Q on the $4 million termination payment. You basically say you believe that the payments under the consulting agreement now may have been for the purposes other than those represented within the consulting agreement. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And is this $4 million payment included in the accounting classifications that you mentioned earlier? Hyun Park : So Paul, this is Hyun Park, the company's new COO. What I would say is that as these investigations proceed, we learn more and we understand more. And as we do so we update our disclosure and the language that's in the Form 10-K is it reflects our current understanding of that situation. So, I'll just refer you to the Form 10-K and the rest of the disclosure in there. Paul Fremont : And does this fall within sort of the accounting payments that are under review or that are being reclassified? Jon Taylor : Yes. Paul, this is Jon. The $4 million was part of the analysis that Chris spoke of earlier. Steven Strah : But I would just say for sake of clarity that if we talk about a nominal payment amount that doesn't necessarily equate to the amount that would have been included in customer rates. There's a whole rate making process and timing around that that really translates the nominal dollar amount that we're talking about relative to the payment into what would actually landed in customer rates. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to start just as you think about your equity needs over time in terms of just your overall approach. I guess if you were to sell just common stock at the current level, it's obviously very dilutive given the very low multiple. We've seen other utilities approach raising capital and in pretty interesting ways in much more accretive ways for example, selling the minority stake and in some divisions. Looks like there is tremendous amount of appetite among sort of infrastructure investors to own pieces of utilities. As you think about, I know you don\u2019t about eminent needs, but as you think conceptually about your approach to raising equity, or do you sort of open to different approaches, are you sort of open to different approaches, what are your thoughts in terms of what might be the range of options and what might look more or less attractive to you? Jon Taylor : Yes. Stephen, this is Jon. I think we\u2019re open to different approaches and in fact we look at that quite regularly. I would tell you \u2013 I think you\u2019re referring to the duke asset sale\u2026 Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s right. Jon Taylor : I would say that first of all we like our platform of companies and we believe each of our companies is uniquely situated to provide investment opportunities to better serve customers and provide growth in earnings and operating cash flow. I think there is going to be a significant investment opportunities at each of these companies that are going to be important to our success but yes we\u2019ve looked at that transaction that appears to be successful transaction for Duke and it's a very interesting transaction. So we've looked at those types of things in the past and for us it just hasn't worked primarily due to tax leakage. But I understand the minority interest piece. But in our normal assessment of our strategy, we look at those types of - we look at those types of things. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And tax leakage might not be as much of an issue in the minority stakes situation Jon, is that right? Jon Taylor : That's right. Stephen Byrd : One last one just for me, just on the lobbying side, I appreciate the approach that you are all taking - my understanding is more limited activity, more disclosure. It's been a challenge for us to follow lobbying activity not just for FirstEnergy, but for others around the 501(c)(4) structure, there is virtually no visibility. Could you just talk to sort of what you said more disclosure, what could we expect in terms of money given the 501(c)(4) is how do we sort of get confidence as to what money is going where? Jon Taylor : Well, good question. Just so we're clear on our current approach. Under my leadership, we made some significant changes immediately. So we\u2019ve seized all political contributions and we\u2019re evaluating what our path forward will be when playing in that space I would say. And then also includes 501c(4)s. You can count on us not contributing to any 501c(4) that is politically focused and that\u2019s going to form the basis of our activity going forward. So what we\u2019re doing we\u2019re working internally, and we\u2019re working with our Board of Directors to get clarity around what our internal expectations are, what our philosophy and pathway will be moving ahead. And the way I look at it we're going to get involved in items of this kind in which we could look at every employee directly in the eye and explain the why behind the what - of what we're doing in this arena. So what we're working on at least from our standpoint is that great reduction in 501c(4) giving anyway. So it's going to be a nonfactor for us. And then secondly we're going to be working with the subcommittee of our audit committee from a compliance standpoint to make sure that we have the reporting that we need internally that will satisfy us and then we'll work to form something that we will publish in our FactBook and - and in other areas. That's our current thinking. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So I have two questions. One about the FFO to their expectations, your equity needs are unchanged, your earnings in Ohio are down, so how can you maintain the same FFO to that? Jon Taylor : Well, I think as we invest in our transmission business and these distribution enhancement programs, it naturally generates FFO. And so, even in our plant not every Ford and our current equity plan, we continue to trend upwards from the 10% we\u2019re at now. So, as we continue to invest in these programs, we manage our cost internally, that should naturally provide for higher FFO to debt. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And separately on electric transmission, it seems like FERC will be making some changes to competitive transmission. You guys have a very sizeable electric transmission network, do you think that any changes order 1,000 or actually basically accelerate growth prospects for this business and also with regards to potential asset sales I understand the tax leakage, but would the sale of the transmission business a parts of it also have this issue with the tax basis given that this business seems newer and so I would assume that the tax basis is much higher. Thank you. Jon Taylor : Angie from our view point, any work that FERC is doing on FERC 1000 we\u2019re staying plugged into and collaborating where we need to. But right now our operating posture going forward will be to continue to maximize investments and improve reliability in our transmission system on our own native footprint. And as we\u2019ve explained in prior calls, we literally have multiple decades of investment opportunities there for us. We will have our complete transmission system overtime and formulate our grades. And we view it as a an excellent growth platform for our company, but I would also want to emphasize that we have clearly improved reliability for those areas are energizing the future transmission program is focused on, in particular in terms of reducing customer outages and in some cases by 50%. So, we\u2019ll let FERC continue their work. But currently, our current business plan is solid once again we have a great and diverse footprint to move investments around. And that's what you can count on us for moving ahead. Steven Strah : And Angie to your second question, if you look at FET the tax basis is probably lower than you think because of bonus depreciation and dividends and that type of thing. So, the transaction that Stephen was mentioning wouldn't even trigger a tax consequence just because you're selling a minority share. But if you were to sell a bigger share, it would have some tax consequences. Operator : Our final question this morning is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lapides : Thank you for taking my questions and it sounds like you're making a lot of progress on a lot of change over a short period of time. I have a few. First of all, in your 2021 guidance, are you incorporating a step up in kind of G&A costs I mean obviously the various law firms, external advisors like McKinsey, I would assume they aren\u2019t free, so I assume that\u2019s a little bit of headwind if it\u2019s possible to quantify it. That\u2019s the first question. The second question is a little bit on pension funding requirements. There\u2019s detail in the back of the slide deck. I just want to sanity check. Are you commenting am I reading this right that the cash pension funding requirement as of now is actually a little bit less than some of your maybe your disclosure at this time last year? Jon Taylor : Michael, this is Jon. So you're correct. It's about $100 million lower in 2022 and 2023. I think it went from $500 million to $400 million. And that's primarily attributable to the asset performance this year. We had tremendous asset performance in our pension portfolio close to 15% and so that reduced the funding obligation for those years. With respect to your question around costs, I actually think we're going to see costs decline. Operating costs decline year-over-year because we're not anticipating as much what I'll call pandemic costs that we incurred in 2020. If you think about all the personal protective equipment all the contractors and bad debt expense for our receivables that we incurred in 2020, although we expect that to continue at summary, but not to the rate that we saw in 2020. So I actually think you'll see a stop a step down in our G&A costs. Michael Lapides : Got it. So G&A down year-over-year when I think about the 2020 to 2021 bridge? Jon Taylor : That's correct. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one last thing, it hadn't really come up on this call. Can you talk about the process Steve for the seat docket and what you're hearing if anything as you kind of prep up for that process to ramp again starting this spring? Steven Strah : Yes. So Michael I would just say that is an open docketed item and just as we had mentioned earlier we're going to take a very open and collaborative approach on that. And for a further view I'd like to just turn it to Irene. Irene Prezelj : Thanks, Steve. I would say that currently were scheduled to file testimony in that proceeding March 1st. But I would add that the consumer advocate in Ohio has asked for a procedural stay on that process pending legislative outcome. So we're waiting to see how the commission acts on that. But as Steve said, this is one of the many proceedings that we want to address in a collaborative transparent fashion with our stakeholders and intend to do so. Michael Lapides : Got it. And it\u2019s there history and prior seat dockets have coming to a settlement like agreement with the various parties including PUCO staff? Irene Prezelj : Yes. We have reached settlement in prior seat cases. Operator : Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Strah for closing comments. Steven Strah : Thank you very much. I wanted to thank everybody for joining today and your continued support. Thanks for your questions and your insights. Our performance in 2020 was solid. This year we're committed to continuing that very strong focus in performance and operations while we're hard at work transforming FirstEnergy for the future and continuing to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. So thank you very much for joining us today. I wish all of you to be healthy and safe during this pandemic period and all the best to you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investor section of our website under the Earnings Information link, and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the Strategic & Financial Highlights document on the Investor section of our website. Participants in today's call include are; President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Vice Chairperson and Executive Director, John Somerhalder. We will also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Strah : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which is in the upper end of our guidance range. As Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses. Last month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors. I greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me since I was named President last May, and Acting CEO in October. I have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities. It's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success. As we work to move FirstEnergy Forward, my priorities are; the continued safety of our employees and customers, ensuring that ethics, accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program. Executing FE Forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential, deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers. During today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice Investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments. John Somerhalder will join us for an update on the Board and management's work towards instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity. Then Jon Taylor will review our results and other financial topics before we open it up for your questions. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations. We have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility, FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. We can't currently predict the timing, outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ. Our goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review. This approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy. For example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s; we paused all other political disbursements, including from our Political Action Committee; and we've limited our participation in the political process. We have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships. In addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency. For example, we have committed to post updates on our website on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our Corporate Political Activity Policy, which is under revision. A comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity. In Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty affecting our utilities in the state. This includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million. This comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law, plus interest. The partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues, and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers. Together, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers. These are important steps to put this matter behind us. In other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP Quadrennial review case to provide perspective seek values on an individual company basis. We are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 SEET cases that were consolidated into this proceeding. During our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments. Those conversations are underway in each affected jurisdiction. In Ohio at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments. Outside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate. For example, on March 1, JCP&L filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seeking approval for its proposed EV-driven program. If approved, the four-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers. And in late March, the Pennsylvania PUC approved our five-year $390 million Energy Efficiency & Conservation Plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets. In other recent developments, last week, FERC approved our uncontested JCP&L forward-looking formula rate settlement without any modifications. In March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump-storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million. And we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly, New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local Co-Op. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers. During our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our companywide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry-leader delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns. We expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid, while also maintaining affordable electric bills. During the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve. While our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes, take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees. We've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter. Examples of this work include, improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers. Leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs, using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self-service options and improve their experience. And leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms. As part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer-focused strategic priorities. We will also remain focused on emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure and our customers evolving energy needs as we think through how to reduce our carbon footprint. We're off to a great start this year and yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Our leadership team is committed to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing on our proven strategies as we put our customers at the center of everything we do. We will take the appropriate steps to deliver on our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, the investment community, regulators and our employees. Thank you for your time and confidence. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder. John Somerhalder : Thanks, Steve and hello, everyone. It's a privilege and a pleasure to join you today. I'd like to start by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after almost two months in this role. This is a company with a firm foundation, including a commitment to improve in the area of governance and compliance, our commitment to customers by embracing innovation and technology to help ensure the strength, resilience and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deep-seated and strong safety culture and a strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer-focused growth. Since joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions and enhancing our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community. Steve spoke about our business priorities. So I will focus my remarks today on our compliance work including remedial actions. First, I'd like to update you on our internal investigation, which has revealed no new material issues since our last earnings call. The focus of the internal investigation has transitioned from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with the ongoing government investigations. Management and the Board with the assistance of the Compliance Subcommittee of the Audit Committee have been working together to build a best-in-class compliance program. Through these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in five broad categories, including governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management and third-party management. As part of these efforts, FirstEnergy is embracing a commitment to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class. Some of the actions completed to-date include hiring our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park in January, Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week and myself. On the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno joined us from Icahn Capital in March, and the Board has nominated a new independent member, Melvin Williams for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting, when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month. I believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to round out a very committed and competent Board and management team. In March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by naming him CEO. Steve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills, strategic acumen and deep knowledge of our businesses needed to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability. These changes along with the Board's reinforcement of and the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top will support a culture of compliance going forward. For instance, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance Subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders regarding the expectations to act with integrity in everything we do. Our legal department recently completed training on up-the-ladder reporting and we have enhanced our on-boarding process for new employees and for third-parties on expectations around our code of business conduct. Over the course of the next few months, there will be many more steps the company will take to enhance our compliance program, such as continuing to build the new, more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership, addressing our processes, policies and controls, which include additional oversight for political contributions, continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees, incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees regardless of title to the same standards. Enhancing the channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct and ensuring increased communications with and training of employees with respect to our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures, compliance requirements, our code of business conduct and other company policies and understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or code of business conduct. We have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals. Targeted reviews of any suspicious payments, and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company. Additionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed. A detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter FactBook. Over the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, where it will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management's Steering Committee for ethics and compliance. Through these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings. Our leaders are continuing to elevate the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics our core values just like safety. We are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and are comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear of repercussions by continually emphasizing the importance of compliance to our strategies and future, as well as demonstrating that we are setting the right tone at the top. We strive to bolster confidence among our employees that the management team and the Board are taking the proper decisive actions to move the company forward. I believe we have learned a lot from recent challenges, and are taking the right actions to emerge as a better, stronger company with a bright future. Now I'll turn the floor over to Jon Taylor for a review of first quarter results and a financial update. Jon Taylor : Thanks, John. Before I review the quarter, you have probably noticed a new look to the materials posted to our website. We have provided new disclosures in three main areas within our Investor FactBook. Our steps to support a cleaner, smarter grid and the movement to more green and renewable resources, additional disclosures on our balance sheet, including our funds from operations target and the steps we're taking to achieve our goals and third, enhanced ESG disclosures. Also note that we continue to provide more robust disclosures on our ROEs, including more granular sensitivities. Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2021, and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. GAAP results for 2021 include two special items, regulatory charges related to customer refunds associated with previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues and expenses associated with the investigation. In our distribution business, our results for the first quarter of this year, as compared to 2020 reflect higher residential usage on both in actual and weather adjusted basis, as well as growth from incremental riders and rate increases, including DCR and grid monetization in Ohio, the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey. These drivers were partially offset by $0.10 per share related to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forego the collection of lost distribution revenues from our residential and commercial customers. Our total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 2% on a weather adjusted basis as compared to the last year, reflecting an increase in residential sales of 2% as customers continue to spend more time at home in the first quarter of 2021, a decline of 7% in commercial sales and in our industrial class first quarter load decreased 3%. It's worth noting that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter are consistent with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher versus our forecast. While industrial load is down 2%. In our regulated transmission business, earnings decreased as a result of higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest, partially offset by the impact of rate-based growth at our FE and made subsidiaries. Finally, in our corporate segment, results reflect lower operating expenses, offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 Pension/OPEB credit related to Energy Harbor's emergence from bankruptcy, as well as higher interest expense. We're off to a solid start for the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021. We've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share. In addition, our strong focus on cash helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and a $185 million increase in free cash flow versus our internal plan for the first quarter. As to a couple of other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on track. In March, FirstEnergy Transmission issued $500 million in senior notes in a strong, well supported bond offering that showcased the strength of our transmission business. The deal was oversubscribed and on par with an investment grade offering. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility. In addition, we repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy holding company. We also successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at MonPower in April that was also very well supported. This supports our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings, as well as our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy. Return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintain the strong credit ratings at our utilities. We continue to provide the rating agencies with regular updates on our business and we are working with them to develop a clear outline of what is needed to return FirstEnergy to investment grade credit ratings. Key milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation and solid credit metrics. As to more longer-term financing needs, through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023. Mainly at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies. Additionally, as we have previously mentioned, equity is an important part of our overall financing plan, with plans to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023. As we said previously, will flex these plans as needed and we are also exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more value enhancing to all stakeholders. These actions combined with new rates at JCP&L and our 60% plus formula rate capital investment program, will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow each year, while maintaining relatively flat adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range. Starting to our pension, our funding status was 81% at March 31st, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulted in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies. The extended funding timeframe permitted under the American Rescue Plan, together with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules, means that we do not expect any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets. Although we plan to make contributions into the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we assess our capital allocation plans. As Steve mentioned, discussions have begun with the Department of Justice. While no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that it is probable we will incur a loss in connection with a resolution of this investigation. However, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount. Finally, last month, President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax, as well as potential opportunities related to proposed infusion into the electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid. Clearly, it's very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form. Our solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems. As we move our company forward, we are laser-focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers and employees. Thank you for your time. Now let's open the call to your Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Now we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Hey, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Real quickly this one's probably for John. Your prior guidance and disclosure before the act passed in March of this year that impacts pension assume pretty sizable pension funding requirements in 2022 and beyond. If you're no longer making those pension funding requirements, why wouldn't the equity funding requirements go down in lockstep? Jon Taylor : Well, Michael I appreciate the question. At least from my perspective, the equity is an important part of achieving our targeted FFO to debt of 12% to 13%. So if it's not used to pay down pension obligations, it would be used to pay down other balance sheet-related debt. So we are laser-focused on improving the balance sheet, getting it up to that 12% to 13% and equity is a key component of that. Michael Lapides : In other words, what you're basically saying is, you're saving cash but not having to make pension requirements, but you're looking to delever, like you recognize, hey, we need to delever, we're more levered than our peer group, lets delever reduce the risk profile play for the higher ratings from the\u2026 Jon Taylor : That's right, that's right. Michael Lapides : Okay, super. Jon Taylor : If you look at where we're going to be this year, somewhere around 10% to 10.5% FFO to debt, that's not acceptable for us. We want to be at the 12% to 13% and then have a plan to improve going forward. Michael Lapides : Got it, makes a ton of sense. Okay, one follow-up. You all gave great detail on a lot of the distribution CapEx projects or potential projects, meaning, state-by-state, et cetera. What I'm struggling a little bit to understand is, aligning that detail with what's actually in your CapEx guidance on the distribution segment, meaning, are things that you filed for, say, the EV - in Pennsylvania or the EV project in New Jersey grain as that one's kind of small what's in guidance and which of these are not in guidance? Or are these all upside the guidance? Jon Taylor : So, Michael, I would tell you that some of the filings that we've made that have not been approved are not in our CapEx forecast currently. So that would be upside to the CapEx programs. What we have that's in our forecast now are those items that have been approved other than, I think, in 2022 and 2023, we do assume that we're going to roll into a grid mod 2 program. So I think that would be the only item out there that's in our forecast that has not been approved. Michael Lapides : Meaning\u2026 Steve Strah : Yes, and that's - that's - I'm sorry, Michael, that's in Ohio, grid mod 2 is in Ohio. Michael Lapides : Right, okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Steve Strah : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks. So just a question on your comments on Ohio regulatory updates. So last call, you talked about pursuing kind of a goal to comprehensively resolve all regulatory issues in Ohio. And then it sounds like on this call, you are now officially engaged in settlement talks on the SEET issues, both backward and looking forward. Is that correct? Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes, good morning. It's Eileen Mikkelsen, I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Thanks, Steve, for your question. We have engaged with a broad range of parties in Ohio, in open, transparent kind of constructive discussions about a whole range of issues that are pending in Ohio. We had our first broad-based meeting on March 31 of this past quarter, very well attended, represented by folks that represent really all of our customer groups. And in the course of that discussion, we are talking about the Quadrennial Review, the SEET cases, both historical and prospective, as well as many, many other matters. I would say that, in the course of those discussions, I think the parties expressed to us generally an appreciation for the approach that we were taking in Ohio to resolving these matters. And also, generally an appreciation for the actions that the companies taken today in Ohio to move past the issues that we currently face. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So, to put it another way, you put out the olive branch to have these discussions and it does appear that the parties, the key parties at least are willing to talk\u2026 Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes that's\u2026 Steve Fleishman : Are you in settlement talks of these various issues? Steve Strah : Yes, Steve, I want to be sensitive to the ongoing discussions. But at the end, we felt good as a team about the level of engagement. And as we had talked through on our prior call, part of this for us is a listening tour, right, just to listen to the various constituencies, work to understand where we can find common ground. And I think that process is often running just as we had committed to. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And is this something that is - because I don't think it's been something that's going to come up in any of the dockets for those - all those different cases? So is this something that's going to continue on kind of outside the dockets of the cases? Eileen Mikkelsen : I think that conversations with the parties will continue ultimately if there's resolution of matters related to specific dockets, that resolution would be posted to those dockets. But the conversations are outside of the formal proceedings at this point. Steve Fleishman : Great, thanks. One other question just for Jon. On the equity alternatives that you're - that you talk about reviewing for that, is that and the only thing I can really think of that would maybe fit that would be with the asset sales. And maybe you could just talk about if you are reviewing that, what would be your objectives just like lower cost, less dilution or would there be other like strategic things that you might be looking at if you are reviewing asset sales? Jon Taylor : Yes, Steve. I mean I guess the way I think about it, there are many different alternatives to raise equity capital that would be much more accretive than issuing common equity for instance, something like the Duke Indiana transaction that was announced earlier this year. Obviously, it would have to be in line with our balance sheet priorities. Our focus on long-term customer focus growth. But yes, we're looking at a range of options to maximize value given our equity needs. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time and the opportunity. Perhaps, if I can to follow-up on the last couple of questions. First, can you elaborate a little bit more on what we could expect out of any resolution in Ohio? I know you provided some parameters about how you're engaging with stakeholders. But what would you expect to the extent success over here? I mean, could this be more than just resolution to the SEET test for instance? Any additional color would be appreciated. As well\u2026 Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes, thanks\u2026 Julien Dumolin-Smith: \u2026as whether the deferred prosecution agreement is a prerequisite? I suspect not. But I just want to ask that explicitly. Eileen Mikkelsen : Exactly and then I'm going to address the regulatory discussions, and then I'll defer to others on the question with respect to the deferred prosecution agreement. But with respect to the settlement, we are as Steve said, we're engaged in kind of a listening exercise, our first meeting, we spent really just listening to all the parties, what areas were of interest to them and it addressed a broad range of issues beyond necessarily the SEET and the Quadrennial Review cases. So we're going to continue to let that process play out, it's a little too early to call what the outcome will be. But we are committed to being as open and as transparent as we can be throughout the process, listening and trying to react to what's important to the other parties. Steve Strah : Yes, Julien, on your second point, I'd like to just separate the potential for deferred prosecution agreement from anything that we're doing in Ohio. That - that's the way I'm viewing it right now. And let me just spend a moment on the developments with the Department of Justice, because I suspect I'll get a question later, even. But, you know, the resolution discussions that we spoke of today are constructive in their positive development for our company. As for the details of timing, the potential for fine or penalties I really can't speculate on that at all. And I just do want to say though, I'm encouraged by our dialogue and I'm encouraged that we are certainly going to continue to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice. And I just want to be very respectful of that process and not get ahead of it at all. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Okay, understood. If you don't mind, can I clarify the last question, I think you were responding to Mike here on the FFO to debt metrics and where you stand today versus prospectively, because you talk about this FFO increase here of $150 million to $200 million annually in FFO off of 2020 through '23 now, and then you talk about adjusted debt being relatively flat, shouldn't that sizably itself already address the delta that you need to get back to where you want in your credit metrics? I just want to understand where the starting position when you're thinking about, you know, any equity alternatives or incremental equity beyond what's already in the plan of $600 million? Jon Taylor : Well, Julien, I would say that, you know, our adjusted debt levels remaining relatively flat assume up to $1.2 billion of equity. So that's part of the plan to keep, you know, our adjusted debt relatively flat to where it was at the end of 2020. And then from an FFO perspective, I mean, if you're - if 60% of your CapEx program is on formula rates, you're going to see some slight load benefits over the next two or three years as industrial and commercial come back. We have the JCP&L rate case that's going to be implementing new rates at the end of this year, that's going to be cash flow positive at the end of this year and to next year. So that's really going to be driving that incremental FFO of up to $150 million, $200 million a year for the next few years. And if we keep our adjusted debt levels and naturally, you'll grow into that 12% to 13%. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Right, said differently, status quo, you're already on track to get back through your metrics need to be. And we should be thinking about any incremental equity as addressing any incremental needs that might not come out of the organic business, but rather specific to funding requirements with - PPA or otherwise. Jon Taylor : Correct. Correct. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you for clarifying that, guys. Have a great day. Steve Strah : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Steve Strah : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to shift gears a bit here, if I could and with the Biden infrastructure plan granted at very early innings and things can you know, still kind of change shape over time, but just wondering at this stage, what do you see the you know the opportunities for FE at this point if the plan were to come to fruition as kind of broadly proposed right now? Steve Strah : Well I think there's potential for our company very clearly. We have, being a fully regulated transmission and distribution company in a five-state area with a diversity of assets that we have that may well be impacted, of course, in the transition in whatever form it takes to cleaner energy, will certainly benefit our company and I think we're well positioned for that. I believe there's other factors that will come into consideration as the administration goes through the necessary next steps. You know, we have to have a very thoughtful transition embedded in this plan. There are economic impacts, potential reliability impacts for the T&D systems that we want to stay mindful of. And, look, the issue is not going to go away climate and some of the planning in the United States is progressing forward and we all have to do our part. As you look at the overall goals, and you look at our ESG - greenhouse gas reduction goals, you know, we have already placed out there a goal of a 30% reduction in carbon from 2019 levels by the year 2030. And we are on our way to achieving that. And we have a carbon neutrality goal in in 2050. So, you know, I think our goal, our business plan or strategy is consistent with what the Biden administration proposed. But I think there's a lot of work to do to take it from a policy statement to on-the-ground improvements. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, that makes sense. And then turning over to the FERC. It seems like there's possibly some developments there on the RTO adder side, and was just wondering if you could provide any thoughts that you have there on that, broadly speaking and what impacts that could have to FE if that does happen? Eileen Mikkelsen : Yes, happy to address that question. Thank you. When we look at the impact, is in fact with this Supplemental NOPR that FERC issued, which really, maybe puts to rest this issue of the 50 basis point incentive that transmission organizations have been given for participation in RTO. If we quantify that, it's probably between $0.04 and $0.05 for us on a total basis across all our transmission organizations. But I think it's also important to recognize, this is just a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has to go through a comment, reply comment period and then take FERC action. And I would also point out that at the same time, FERC really initiated technical conference with respect to transmission incentives related to performance rate making, shared savings mechanisms in order to incent transmission and that meeting scheduled to occur in September of 2021. So I think there's some puts and takes on what may happen with transmission ROAs and of course, as you might expect, we're going to stay very actively engaged in all of those discussions. Steve Strah : Yes, I think that's excellent, Eileen and I would just add, obviously, our transmission business is very important to our strategy. As Eileen outlined, the $0.04 to $0.05 is a concern obviously, we'll monitor it, but it's not enough to throw our company off track certainly. We also have the advantage as a company to, as I stated earlier, we have a very large footprint of diverse transmission and distribution assets in which we can invest in multiple opportunities, should this development become a little bit more impactful to us. Jeremy Tonet : That's really helpful. Last one, if I could real quick here. With regards to equity alternatives as you kind of touched on there and looking at where recent assets sales have treated, is there any reason you would issue equity at these levels instead of an asset sale? And given how the plan is for $600 million next year, should we expect kind of more news on that front sooner if it takes a period of time to execute the sale if you do choose to go that route? Jon Taylor : Well, Jeremy, I think that's one of the reasons we're looking at a trade like that. I mean, if you just take the Duke Indiana forward multiple, it's like issuing common equity at $50 a share. And so you have to take a look at those types of options when you have an equity need like we do. So I mean I think that's one of the reasons we are looking at, you know, something similar to that type of transaction. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, that makes sense. That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrd : Thanks for the really thorough update. Just a couple of additional questions for me. On governance, I understand you're sort of under revision on your entire approach. You mentioned more limited involvement in the political process, I wondered if you could just add a little bit more color unless a sort of premature given you're sort of under review now? Steve Strah : Well, as you said, Stephen, it's under review, we are integrating our thinking in terms of formalizing a revised political activity policy. So that's currently under revision. In the interim, I thought it was very important for our company to take the necessary actions that we did in terms of, you know, ceasing, giving the 501(c)(4)s as an example. The activity that we talked about in terms of no disbursements out of our Political Action Committee. We are taking a deep breath, putting a revision together that makes sense that will help define that limited scope in the political arena. And the way I view it is, you'll see increased openness and transparency in what we're involved in accountability around that. And we are going to get involved in things in which I could sit down and talk to any of my employees about or any of our customers about, for example, because it would make sense for our company to engage in it for the - betterment of all stakeholders. And that's just my current view right now. There'll be more to come as we really stand up our new compliance program that John Somerhalder spoke out, but that's just our current thinking right now. Stephen Byrd : That's really, really helpful color. And then just one other question for me just in terms of the internal investigation the review that you've been going through. Would you characterize that as sort of broadly complete in terms of sort of fact finding determining just going back through and understanding everything that happened? Or would you say there's a significant additional work needed to kind of complete that investigation? John Somerhalder : I think the good - good news, this is John Somerhalder, is that, you know, since the last earnings call, the investigation has not revealed any new material issues. So we are now transitioning that from, you know, a proactive investigation to, you know, an investigation that will continue to cooperate with ongoing government investigations. So that transition has occurred or is occurring. Stephen Byrd : That's very helpful. That's all I had. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So Steve, you mentioned that there is a separation between the DOJ negotiations and what's happening in Ohio. But then again, it seems like the agreement with the Ohio Attorney General was more of a standstill agreement, at least to me, as everybody awaits the outcome of the DOJ negotiations. It seems like you guys are waiting with issuing that well, at least JCP&L and Toledo. Again, in anticipation of the potential DOJ settlements. And I'm just wondering if it's a fair assessment of what's happening? Steve Strah : Well, Angie, the way I would look at it is, we have certainly a lot of moving pieces here that we have to coordinate appropriately. And to the extent, you know, we're going to deal with and fully cooperate with the DOJ, in my view, that's one workstream that we're working on. All the activity that we have in Ohio, which I find, encouraging, but we have a lot more work to do there, that's a separate workstream. We have multiple others that we're working through. The way I would look at it is, to the extent that that may or may not influence our financing plan, we just integrate that into the way the pieces are moving for us. And once again, Jon Taylor outlined the success that we've had in the markets. And I think we are all - with all the moving pieces we have, we're in a stable environment with regard to all of that. So I guess that's perhaps my best way to approach your question. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And separately, thank you for the additional disclosures in the FactBook - greatly - these are greatly appreciated. One of the things that you guys mentioned there is that, you are considering the distribution rate cases in all of your jurisdictions, which I take, includes, Ohio. So far, you've mentioned SEET as the issue that is being discussed with different intervenors in Ohio, how about filing a distribution rate case early in the state? Eileen Mikkelsen : Well, I think - yes, I want to remind folks that January 1st of this year, we actually implemented our JCP&L distribution-based rate case settlement, Jon mentioned how that will be accretive from a cash perspective starting later this year. I think last week FERC approved our JCP&L transmission forward-looking formula uncontested rate settlement, beginning January 1st of this year, we moved our remaining transmission assets to a forward-looking formula rates subject to hearing and settlement procedures. We are scheduled to have a rate case filed in Maryland for our Potomac Edison by the first quarter of 2023. And we're on schedule to file for our three Ohio companies by the end of our ESP, which is May of 2024. And so beyond that, we kind of are continually evaluating how our costs stack up against our revenues to make judgments about if and when it would be appropriate to seek base rate cases. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Steve Strah : Thanks, Angie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Just wanted to clarify something, Jon, in your commentary, you mentioned removal of a material weakness, you know, driven by the actions you're taking on the governance front. Is that sort of audit-driven requirement? Or is that something that sort of you're working with in tandem with credit agencies? Jon Taylor : Well, I would tell you that, this is Jon Taylor. We have two [Johns] [ph] on the call. So I'll take the first piece of it. And then if there's some follow-up, that John Somerhalder wants to add, we can do that as well. But I do think, you know, the material weakness is important to be remediated as part of our, you know steps around the culture and around the tone at the top, around governance and compliance. So I do think, you know, we spoke a little bit with the rating agencies about the plans around the material weaknesses, so I do think that's important to them. But also, I think what's important to them is just more broadly, you know, the enhancements that we want to make to the compliance program. John Somerhalder : Yes, this is John Somerhalder, just to follow-up on that, you know, the set of recommendations and if you look in the FactBook on Pages 8 and 9, those are things that we're pursuing in combination with our subcommittee of the - compliance subcommittee of the Audit Committee. Those are the type of recommendations that address a number of issues related to having best-in-class compliance - ethics and compliance program. That's very important to us. We're putting a high priority on that, but then that will allow our internal yes that Jason and the internal folks as well as our external auditor to then work through the issues related to the material weakness. That's why we indicate that we have a plan both to implement those recommendations and deal with the material weakness that we anticipate will allow us to deal with the - remediate the material weakness by the time we file our fourth quarter Q or the K and announce our fourth quarter earnings. Durgesh Chopra : Understood, thank you. Just a quick follow-up to that, is there sort of a - and I think you sort of touched on this in your prepared remarks, but is there sort of a roadmap or sort of boxes you need to check in terms of actions you need to take from a governance standpoint for the credit rating agencies to get more constructive? Have they shared sort of any qualitative or quantitative information with you to that effect? Jon Taylor : Yes, we're working through that, Durgesh right now with them. I mean, I think they're going to want to see, you know, us institute some of these enhancements that we've laid out in the FactBook around governance and compliance. You know, as well as maybe some of the detailed controls that we've implemented around disbursements that we spoke of in our prepared remarks. You know, they want to be sure that this type of issue will not happen again, that we have the control structure, the culture to ensure that this type of issue will not happen again or that we built the controls and the culture that would prohibit that type of - those types of issues. So I think they'll be focused on those types of issues. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning. Steve Strah : Good morning. Paul Patterson : Just on the - and I apologize for this. But the decoupling, it looked like it was a $0.10 impact on the quarter. And I was wondering if I was reading that correctly and just sort of can you walk us again through what the impact for the years supposed to be sort of? Jon Taylor : Yes, so Paul, just if you think about last year, decoupling was implemented in the first quarter, so there was an adjustment in the first quarter to true up 2019 revenues to the decoupling level. So that was a piece of it. The other piece of it that was fairly significant was the fact that in 2020, the temperatures were very, very mild. And so the decoupling adjusted for the mild temperatures and the input - and the impact on load. And then a smaller piece was the lost distribution revenues that we - that we're not pursuing collection on. So that - those are the components that made up the $0.10, that kind of - it's like $0.04, $0.04, $0.02 kind of thing. I think, you know, going forward in the second quarter, you'll probably see a $0.03 headwind and then in the third quarter, it'll be a $0.04 headwind. And then obviously, when we get into the fourth quarter that's when we took the charge associated reversing all of that. And so that'll flip for us. Paul Patterson : Okay. Okay, great. And then just back to the 501(c)(4)s stuff, is that - I wasn't clear whether or not the - how much of this was permanent or not? And part of the statement seems to be a pause on the PAC stuff. And then I just wasn't clear, is the 501(c)(4) policy that you guys are implementing, is that a - perceived to be a permanent impact more or less than? And if so, kind of, is there a benefit from in terms of just financially speaking in terms of not distributing that - Steve Strah : Paul, the way I would put it, I'm sorry. Paul Patterson : No, no you please go ahead, I apologize for that. Steve Strah : The way I would put it is, that decision is currently under review with our company, you know, 501(c)(4)s, when you look at it, there's a societal benefit component to it in which you can help community-based organizations. The other component of it, the way I look at it is, the political end of that spectrum. And that's certainly an area that we are not going to participate in, period. So as we work this through, our going forward measure will be not to contribute to 501(c)(4)s. Paul Patterson : Okay. And is there any - when we take all this stuff into account, what have you, is there any significant financial impact I've seen depending on different companies is of significant a number sometimes, is there a potential economic benefit that we could see as a result of this that's worth mentioning or is it still under - Steve Strah : No, Paul, I would not look at it in that way. The way I would look at it is, look, we're going to continue to be an excellent corporate citizen in helping the communities and our customers in the areas in which we work and live with them. And that's the way I'm viewing our giving levels going forward like you know, a large part of it. So, there won't be a large financial impact or embedded savings, I would say. Paul Patterson : Awesome. Thanks for the clarification. Thank you. Steve Strah : Okay. Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Charles Fishman : Thank you for some bearing cleanup. Hey, just one question on transmission, your forecasted investment have found what $100 million [technical difficulty] one you lowered the bottom of the range [technical difficulty]. My question would be, is that reduction is project specific? Or is it - or do you want to see a little more clarity on some of the third cases? Is it balance sheet enhancement that's slowing down occasionally investment? Or I guess the fourth choice? Or maybe just all of the above, is it to do with the Biden plan of the $100 million in transmission and what impact or what opportunities that could create for the regulated transmission? Jon Taylor : Yes. Charles, this is Jon. So you're right, that we did adjust some of the CapEx programs in transmission that was mainly associated with the FE Forward program that we're rolling out, some of that will impact transmission as we look to lower our overall cost structure and become more efficient as we transform the company. We will consider, you know, ramping up CapEx, you know, once we get clarity around the Department of Justice investigation and outcomes. So that's why we kind of took it off the bottom end of the range in those future years to give us a little bit of flexibility if we wanted to ramp up capital, you know, we could get more work done with less money. Charles Fishman : Got it, okay. I understand the lowering the range 0.2 to 0.3, so $100 million this year, is that project specific stuff? Jon Taylor : So it is - it's not necessarily project specific, but it is associated with restructuring some vendor contracts that we've had. We looked at some of the projects from a health perspective and decided to pull back a little bit until we run it through our new process around asset health modeling. Charles Fishman : Okay, great. Excellent, real helpful. Thank you. That's all I have. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Strah for any final comments. Steve Strah : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for being with us today and your continued support. Our leadership team is committed to transform - transforming FirstEnergy into an industry-leader that can deliver exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. And I hope everyone stays healthy and safe. And we'll talk to you all soon again. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. Please begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation that supports todays discussion and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website. Participants in today\u2019s call include our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Vice Chairperson and Executive Director, John Somerhalder and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor. We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Strah : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we reported second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share, which includes the impact of the deferred prosecution agreement that I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which is above the top end of our earnings guidance. These strong operational results reflect a customer-focused investment strategy in our regulated distribution and transmission businesses, solid financial discipline and the continued shift in higher weather-adjusted demand from our residential customers. We\u2019re pleased with our performance as well as the substantial progress we\u2019ve made to transform FirstEnergy and position our company for the future. We have taken critical steps to build a best-in-class compliance program while identifying and driving initiatives to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Our leadership team is committed to modeling the behaviors and the humility necessary to restore trust with our stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this work and achieving the milestones that will mark our progress. I\u2019ll start our call today with an update on the DOJ and other investigations related to House Bill 6, and John Somerhalder will join us for a brief discussion on board activity and the progress of our compliance program. I\u2019ll come back to review recent business developments and then Jon Taylor will discuss our second quarter results and other financial matters before we open it up to your questions. Yesterday, we announced that we\u2019ve entered into an agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Ohio to resolve the DOJ investigation into FirstEnergy. This deferred prosecution agreement was filed in federal court. Under the three-year deferred prosecution agreement, we agreed to pay $230 million, which will be funded with cash on hand. Half of these funds is designated for the U.S. Treasury and the other half is being directed to the benefit of utility customers by the Ohio Development Service Agency. No portion of the fine will be recovered from customers. We also agreed to the government\u2019s single charge of honest services wire fraud, which will be eventually dismissed, provided we abide by all the terms of the agreement. In accordance with the agreement, we will provide regular reports to the government regarding our compliance program, as well as internal controls and policies and continued efforts to build on the comprehensive compliance initiatives we\u2019ve rolled out this year. In its decision to defer prosecution, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office acknowledged our substantial cooperation with the investigation, along with our significant remedial actions, which include : establishing an executive director position at the Board level, as well as a compliance focused Board subcommittee; hiring a new Chief Legal Officer and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer working to establish a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability at every level of the organization; and reviewing and revising political activity and lobbying and consulting policies, which will include robust disclosures about our lobbying activities. The conduct that took place at our company was wrong and unacceptable. Our Board, the management team and the entire FirstEnergy organization have done extensive work and are committed to make the necessary changes to move on from this. Our progress on these efforts, along with the DPA, demonstrate that we are making meaningful headway in navigating through this period and we are positioned to move forward as a stronger integrity bound organization. We will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations, audits and related matters as we work to resolve these issues and rebuild trust with our employees, customers, regulators and investors. We are intently focused on fostering a strong culture of compliance and ethics and assuring that we have robust processes in place designed to ensure that nothing like this happens again. In May, we held our first compliance town hall with employees to discuss what compliance, ethics and integrity mean at FirstEnergy and the importance of building a culture of trust where everyone is comfortable with speaking up when something doesn\u2019t feel right. In the weeks following the town hall, our management team has responded to employee questions and concerns and we are committed to continuing this conversation and engagement. Next week, we plan to hold another town hall meeting with employees where we will introduce our updated mission statement, reinforcing the role of uncompromising integrity as the cornerstone of FirstEnergy\u2019s identity and business strategies. We will also refresh our core values to better reflect the importance of integrity together with safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence and stewardship. These values will be embedded in our practices and processes and become ingrained in the way we work. Additionally, we updated our code of business conduct, which John Somerhalder will speak to in a moment. We also continue to strengthen our leadership team with two more new hires, Michael Montaque joined us earlier this month as Vice President, Internal Audit. And yesterday, we announced that Soubhagya Parija has been named Vice President and Chief Risk Officer effective August 16. These two experienced professionals represent another important step as we strengthen our key internal functions and I\u2019m confident that they will help us develop best-in-class audit and enterprise risk programs. Now, John Somerhalder will join us to provide an update on board matters and other facets of our compliance program. Then I\u2019ll be back to discuss FE Forward and review some regulatory updates. John Somerhalder : Thanks, Steve. Our progress with the DOJ builds on the substantial steps we have taken to enhance our Board, strengthen our leadership team, ensure we have a best-in-class compliance program and significantly modify our approach to political engagement as we work to regain the trust of our stakeholders. I\u2019ll start with a review of recent Board changes. As you know, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno joined the Board from Icahn Capital in March, but they do not currently have voting rights pending regulatory approval. I\u2019m pleased to note that FERC approved our request for voting rights last week. The process in Maryland continues as we have communicated FERC\u2019s recent action to the Commission. Melvin Williams was elected to the Board at our Annual Meeting in May. And last month, we added two more independent directors, Lisa Winston Hicks and Paul Kaleta. Jesse, Melvin, Lisa and Paul comprise our Special Litigation Committee. This committee has full and binding authority to determine the company\u2019s action with respect to the pending shareholder derivative litigation. I\u2019ll also note that with the formation of the Special Litigation Committee, the Board has dissolved Independent Review Committee. As previously discussed, the company\u2019s internal investigation has now been transitioned from a proactive to a response mode and in light of the significant review, investigation and related actions accomplished by the independent review committee, the Board has also dissolved that committee. But many proactive actions taken by the Board and management over the past year have improved our governance and put us in a strong position to remediate the material weakness associated with our tone at the top by the time we file our four quarter results. Over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the work we\u2019re doing to elevate our ethics and compliance program and reinforce our values and expectations with all employees. We continue to make timely progress in this area and our new, more centralized compliance organization is taking shape under Antonio Fernandez, who joined the company in April as our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Yesterday, we published our updated internal Code of Business Conduct, The Power of Integrity, which will be supported by ongoing education around behaviors and the importance of reporting ethical violations and we have continued to strengthen our policies, processes and internal controls including those around 501(c)(4)s, other corporate engagement and advocacy and business disbursements. While the transformation of our culture and our steps to restore trust with all stakeholders will be long-term endeavors, this team has started building a stronger company built around a foundation of ethics, honesty and accountability. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve. Steve Strah : Thanks, John. The comprehensive assessment and re-calibration of our ethics and compliance program has been running on a parallel path to FE Forward. Our transformational effort to enhance value for all stakeholders by investing in modern and distinctive experiences that will improve the way we do business, we have improved our programmatic efforts to mature our ethics and compliance program into the FE Forward work. In this way, we can leverage FE Forward\u2019s rigor to implement changes quickly and efficiently, embed ethics and compliance into our operational culture and ensure we sustain a comprehensive transformation well into the future. FE forward has entered its third phase, which is a full-scale effort to execute our implementation plans. The program is expected to deliver value and resilience including cumulative free cash flow improvements of approximately $800 million from 2021 through 2023 and an annual run rate capex efficiencies of about $300 million in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, we expect the program to build on our strong operations and business fundamentals as we reinvest a portion of our efficiencies into strategic opportunities to better serve our customers and support a smarter and cleaner electric grid. To ensure our organizational structure supports these improvement over the long term, we realigned our business units last month around five pillars : Finance and Strategy, Human Resources and Corporate Services, Legal, Operations and Customer Experience. This new structure reflects a best-in-class model and supports operational excellence, clarity in decision making and accountability and less complexity. As part of this new organizational structure, we\u2019ve created a customer experience function that will truly understand our customers\u2019 evolving expectations, so we can develop solutions and drive benefits to customers. We\u2019ve also created a new position, Vice President transformation to shepherd the FE Forward initiatives across our company, while also developing customer focused emerging technology opportunities. The development of executable plans, a best-in-class compliance program and critical organizational changes will position the company to move forward in a positive sustainable direction. I\u2019ll just take a moment now and review recent regulatory matters starting in Ohio. First, in July, the PUCO approved our filing to return approximately $27 million to our Ohio utility customers, representing all revenues that were previously collected through the decoupling mechanism plus interest. Our Ohio utilities have filed supplemental testimony in the quadrennial review of our ESP IV. We are committed to working with a broad range of parties in Ohio to resolve the range of issues that are still pending here. We held our first full-scale collaborative meeting on March 31 and have since received further feedback from participants. We are preparing for another collaborative meeting in the next few weeks. We are also working through regulatory audits in Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the FERC. Finally, in April, the New Jersey BPU approved JCP&L\u2019s three year $203 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which includes a return on certain costs, as well as the ability to recover lost distribution revenues. As per our financial results, we\u2019re pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. We are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and we expect to be at the top half of that range. We are also introducing third quarter guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. We remain focused on executing our plans, maintaining our costs and building on this positive momentum. We are making substantial progress to transform FirstEnergy live up to our values and deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jon Taylor for review of second quarter results and the financial update. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.59 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Special items in the second quarter of 2021 include investigation and other related costs, which include the impact from the deferred prosecution agreement, as well as regulatory charges and state tax legislative changes. In our distribution business, 2021 second quarter results as compared to 2020 reflect growth from our capital investment programs, rate increases and lower expenses, primarily related to the absence of pandemic related expenses we incurred in the second quarter of last year, partially offset by the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenues in the second quarter of 2020, which we stopped collecting earlier this year. Total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the second quarter of 2020 when many of the pandemic related restrictions were in full effect. However, the mix of customer usage resulted in a flat year-over-year earnings impact. Second quarter 2021 weather-adjusted residential sales were 6% lower than the same period last year when many of our customers were under strict stay at home orders. However, as we look at trends, weather-adjusted residential usage over the past few quarters has been on average about 4% higher than pre-pandemic levels and in fact, the second quarter of this year was close to 8% higher than weather-adjusted usage we saw in the second quarter of 2019. We think more permanent work from home initiatives could impact our longer-term load forecast and we will be watching closely to see if the structural shift in our residential customer class continues. Weather-adjusted deliveries to commercial customers increased 8% and industrial load increased 11% as compared to the second quarter of 2020. Despite the increase in commercial activity this spring, weather-adjusted demand in this customer class continues to lag pre-pandemic levels by an average of about 6%. Looking at the industrial class, we are encouraged by the steady recovery in demand over the past year. In fact, this quarter, industrial load was only slightly down compared to the second quarter of 2019. We continue to see higher load from the shale gas industry, but that was offset by lower load in other industrial sectors such as steel, auto and mining, which have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In our Regulated Transmission segment, higher net financing costs in the second quarter of 2021, primarily related to our revolving credit facility borrowings were more than offset by the impact of higher transmission investment at MAIT and ATSI related to our Energizing the Future program. Our transmission investments drove year-over-year rate base growth of 7%. And in our Corporate segment results reflect the absence of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2020, as well as higher interest expense. For the first half of 2021, operating earnings were $1.28 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the first half of 2020. This increase was the result of continued investments in our transmission and distribution systems, weather-related sales and lower expenses and consistent with our second quarter results, the positive drivers for the first half of this year more than offset the absence of $0.13 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues that were recognized in the first half of 2020 that are no longer in place this year. Additionally, our continued focus on financial discipline together with strong financial results helped drive a $196 million increase in adjusted cash from operations versus our internal plan and a $264 million increase above the first six months of last year, building on the improvements we noted on our first quarter earnings call. As per capital markets activity, we continue making good progress on this year\u2019s debt financing plan with five of our six debt transactions complete, all with pricing similar to investment grade companies. In May, we issued a $150 million in senior notes at Toledo Edison and MAIT with pricing at 2.65% and 2.55% respectively. And in June, we issued $500 million in senior notes at JCP&L that priced at 2.75%. In addition, we made progress on our commitment to reduce short-term debt during the second quarter by repaying $950 million under our revolving credit facilities bringing our borrowings down to $500 million as of June 30. And earlier this week, we repaid the remaining $500 million under these facilities. While we did obtain a waiver for our credit facilities related to the DPA, this repayment was voluntary and not required by the bank group. We plan to operate on a normal course going forward and we utilize the revolving credit facilities on an as needed basis as we have done historically. As you know, we have two revolving credit facilities, one for FE Corp, which is shared with our utility companies and one for FET both expiring in December of 2022. Over the next few months, we plan to work with our bank group to evaluate and refinance these bank facilities with the goal of completing this initiative before the end of the year. And finally, we continue to consider alternatives to our equity needs. We continue to think through options that include a minority sale of distribution and/or transmission assets, which would raise substantial proceeds and eliminate all of our expected non-SIP equity needs, ensure the execution of our balance sheet improvement plans and provide funding for strategic capex in customer-focused emerging technologies that support the transition to a cleaner electric grid. Based on our current timeframe, we expect to provide you with an update in the fourth quarter. As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning, Steve and Jon. How are you doing? Steve Strah : Good Shahriar. Jon Taylor : Doing well. Shahriar Pourreza : So just on the asset sale. Obviously, you kind of mentioned, you\u2019re still exploring options, even though sort of the DPA came in lighter than expected \u2013 that many expected. Is the main consideration here, is it \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to figure out is it potential shareholder litigation, is it kind of to capture some of the multiple arbitrage opportunities with what sort of infrastructure and various strategics have been willing to pay for assets recently? I mean, have your base, I guess, equity needs increased? And then just as a follow-up, media has reported Mon Power is the potential sale option. So can you maybe just confirm what stage you see as non-core to the overall enterprise. And how we should maybe think about potential sizing of a smaller utility like Mon Power versus a minority stake versus a potential larger optimization like just saying JCP&L as an example? Jon Taylor : Shar, this is John. So, I\u2019ll take that and if Steve wants to add on, I\u2019d happy to do that as well. But I think for us, the priority is around ensuring that we achieve our balance sheet metrics. We have goals of 12% to 13%. We likely will face an additional headwinds with different types of litigation. We got some things cooking in Ohio that we need to deal with and so providing balance sheet support at an efficient cost is the number one priority. With respect to the different assets, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics, but I would tell you that we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress since the first quarter. We are getting more and more comfortable with a minority interest sale in one of our assets and we\u2019re fairly confident that that\u2019s the right path forward. We think we can do this in a way that limits dilution to shareholders, but can raise a significant amount of capital that would eliminate all of our current equity needs, it would achieve our priorities around the balance sheet, provide funding for additional CapEx opportunities, all acknowledging the fact that we have additional headwinds that we\u2019re going to face. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. So near-term, credit and earnings accretive transaction? Jon Taylor : Correct. Yes. Correct. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just lastly for me, and I\u2019ll pass it off to someone else. I\u2019m glad, clearly, we\u2019re moving \u2013 we\u2019re starting to move past all of this, which is a great, great, great signal here. How do we think about maybe the DPA statement of facts as it relates to the overall construct in Ohio? I mean, you have a rate agreement in place, but curious if this can even be revisited in light of the findings. I mean, have you had any conversations with the PUCO following the DPA more specifically? Steve Strah : Shar, this is Steve. Thanks for the question. I think I\u2019m going to start just with a few comments on the DPA and then quickly move to Ohio. This is truly a humbling moment for our company in terms of the DPA, the accountability that we stepped up and took as a company. So, we\u2019re humbled by it, but we do view it as a very positive step for the company with many more steps down the path to restore confidence and trust. Along the way, within the DPA, obviously, we paid a significant penalty for accountability and we take that on and acknowledge that. We\u2019re also going to continue to stay very focused as a team to remain fully compliant with all the requirements of the DPA and fulfilling those requirements will be very, very important for us, as well as continued cooperation with the DOJ. Globally, I believe this is really an inflection point, not only for me as the leader of the organization, but for our company in general. We have a great opportunity as we walk through this challenge, really to show that we can create a much better company at a much better path forward. So, we\u2019re really looking forward to do that and you will see that change and it will be added center, having ethics and integrity at every level within this organization. So, I just wanted to make those statements on the DPA. As it pertains to Ohio, it\u2019s a good question. We have a collaborative underway right now. We\u2019ve had one meeting. We\u2019re hoping to organize another meeting within the next several weeks. So, we want to respect that process and not speculate too much, but we\u2019re confident that we can make significant progress in terms of restoring trust and confidence in the regulatory process. So, it\u2019s our hope that we can put everything that\u2019s on the collective agenda for the collaborative. On the table, discuss it, deal with it and be able to come up with a reasonable solution. Relative to our ESP IV, our base rate case question that we get from time to time, I believe those are one of the elements that are around the table that we\u2019re very willing to discuss. I would also point back just a little bit, Shar, to what we have accomplished in Ohio with regard to not pursuing lost distribution revenue, the refund of decoupling. We have the reestablishment of the 2024 base rate case requirement. And I think the DPA, now that it\u2019s behind us, will open up more opportunities for a pathway forward in Ohio. Shahriar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you so much and best of luck, Steve, in trying to get actually through the next phase. I appreciate it. Thank you. Steve Strah : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Steve Strah : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to have follow-up that, I guess updated [technical difficulty] fourth quarter here, just want to clarify. Is that \u2013 is the fourth quarter update, is that during the quarter or is that with fourth quarter earnings and it seems like it\u2019s a bit of a while off. So, just wondering, is this like a formal kind of bookending announcement that does accomplishes everything at that point? And last part here, I guess, if you think about potential minority interest modernizations and we\u2019ve seen these great valuation markers out there. Just wondering if there is \u2013 how much you\u2019d pursue here whether it is just solving all equity needs, including pension shortfalls, what have you? Jon Taylor : So, Jeremy, this is Jon. So, fourth quarter, so sometime in the fourth quarter, not the fourth quarter call, we\u2019ll provide an update on our plan for equity financing. And so with respect to quantum, we\u2019ll have to see, I would tell you this, right now, we have a $1 billion of non-SIP equity in 2022 and 2023. If you just assume $40 a share, that\u2019s about $0.12 in dilution. If I sold $0.12 and regulated earnings at 32 multiple, that would be about $2 billion in proceeds. Jeremy Tonet : And then kind of shifting gears a bit, I guess towards transmission, just wondering if you had some thoughts on federal infrastructure plan, possibly here and FERC some of the different things coming out there. Just wondering how a few things about that and what opportunity set you see on the transmission side at this point, possibly expanding depending on kind of what happens audit you see there? Steve Strah : Well, very good question. Thank you. This is Steve. I would say, it represents an opportunity for our company based on what I\u2019ve been able to see from the current administration. We have over the course of the last six to seven years developed a true core competency in terms of being able to construct transmission projects and be able to extract the value that\u2019s needed to support a reliable grid and I think that core competency now can be unleashed with any infrastructure plan that is developed and approved through the administration and Congress. So, I see that as a very good opportunity for our company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to just talk at a high level in terms of your business and the potential for the need for additional grid upgrades, improvements, transmission spend, just as you\u2019re thinking at a high level, I know there\u2019s been a lot of focus on, rightly so, on addressing this DOJ investigation, but just now that we\u2019re hopefully in a position to be able to look forward a bit, how do you see sort of the potential areas of growth or maybe particularly what areas of growth are you most excited about in terms of adding to the base plan? What might we see over time? Steve Strah : Well, Steve, I think we have a \u2013 we have an excellent base business plan. Let\u2019s just start there. Our transmission spend, if you call it a $1 billion to a $1.2 billion per year, that\u2019s a very sustainable pipeline of needed work that will span the next two decade period. So, we\u2019re excited about the infrastructure program that might be coming forward. We\u2019re excited about leveraging our transmission system and embracing renewables as they approach the system as an opportunity on the distribution side of the house. I\u2019m particularly excited about some of the programs that we have going on right now with smart grid, smart meter programs. I also believe that our company as well as the utility industry can play a central and key role relative to the infrastructure build out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other emerging technologies. So, I think that all represent a great opportunity for us. I also try to keep the customer in the center of that equation. So, as these emerging technologies are lowering in costs, I think that\u2019s good for customers and once again, I think a company like ours could install these technologies in the best way possible on the T&D system to maximize their value at a low cost. Stephen Byrd : As you\u2019re thinking about sort of your growth plans from here, is there a natural sort of process the FirstEnergy would go through and sort of just continuing to reassess those types of additional need? So, for example, is there sort of a planning process in the fall followed by some degree of an update we could expect next year in terms of just your thinking on where you go from here from a growth perspective? Jon Taylor : Yes, Steven. So this is Jon. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things that we need to work through before we move to providing long-term guidance. Obviously, we have some issues that we need to resolve in Ohio. We have probably five to six different proceedings, we got the collaborative that we\u2019re working through. So, we need to really have some clarity around our Ohio utilities. And then I think we also need to have a little bit more clarity and certainty around our equity plan. And then once we have those two things, I think we can get in to providing more of a long-term guidance range for you. Stephen Byrd : Very fair point. Last question, just maybe going back to the deferred prosecution agreement. There\u2019s a lot of commitments here. I was just curious as you think about factoring these types of commitments into things like executive compensation changes to sort of goals that you lay out better backed by real impacts to executive comp, how might we expect these types of commitments to be factored into compensation of executive? Steve Strah : Well, Stephen, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked through. What we\u2019ve already done, for example, this year, that we\u2019ve integrated a compliance goal into our incentive compensation program for all employees. Right? So, we want to acknowledge positive behaviors in terms of raising issues and acknowledge that look folks are speaking up. We also want to get at other parts of our company in which we might be challenged from an ethics or integrity view. So, that work is already underway and as we\u2019ve stated, it not only in our opening comments, but prior to that, we\u2019re going to make ethics, integrity and openness, every bit is important in this company as safety is to this company. And that for us puts it right at the very top of our focus each and every day, each and every moment. So, while we will talk through additional compensation matters, I\u2019m sure in the future, like every company does, to challenge ourselves for goals that really truly make a difference in performance and propels you forward. We are really just very, very focused on implementing our new Code of Conduct that John mentioned and then also the build out of a best-in-class compliance and ethics program. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Thank you for the time and the opportunity. So, if I can try to rehash or restate some of this a little bit differently. When you think about where you\u2019ll be by year-end, I mean, could we be in a place to effective re-baseline and provide a clean forward outlook, if you will. I mean, effectively, if we\u2019re hearing you right, aspirationally you\u2019ll have addressed the equity needs in a single shot here with a minority sale or something of the like. Ohio should be resolved to the extent at which stakeholders are amenable, including conceivably the next ESP and ultimately you have an O&M program underway that should conceivably keep you within this of the 13% FFO to debt as you\u2019ve already talked about in the past. Can you just kind of affirmed to the thought process and specifically when or if you would think about an updated EPS outlook in turn? Jon Taylor : This is Jon. Yes, Julien, this is Jon. So, I think for sure, we will have clarity around our equity plan in the fourth quarter. I think we will do our absolute best to work with the parties down in Columbus to get some resolution there. I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to take, but if we could get something by the end of the year that would be fantastic. And we would be in a position at that point in time to provide you a long-term outlook including earnings and cash flow. Steve Strah : Yes. And this is Steve. I would just underscore one of Jon\u2019s points here. I would be very pleased to resolve the Ohio issues by year end, for sure, but I am determined to do it in a way in which it truly is collaborative. So, we are not going to be in a rush to do something that\u2019s going to up end the process unnecessarily, but my true hope is that everybody will come to the table with progress and openness on their minds. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Yes, I very much appreciate it. And if I could clarify the FFO to debt commentary and just the overall balance sheet needs. Right? I mean, you obviously, previously articulated this equity need through the forecast period, but as you think about sizing this updated need today, I just want to make sure we understand the baseline should be that you are already poised to achieve the 12% to 13% such that if you want to triangulate here any incremental needs created from resolution in Ohio or regulatory decisions otherwise that\u2019s really what you\u2019re solving for from here, not re-baseline in the balance sheet incrementally. Right? I just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same period of this? Jon Taylor : Yes. That makes sense. If you remember, our base plan probably had us growing FFO $150 million, $200 million a year, we had our financing plan, which was really going to hold our debt levels somewhat flat or adjusted debt levels given where the pension is performing and our go-forward financing plan that included a $1 billion of equity. So, to the extent that we face headwinds in Ohio, we\u2019ll be solving for that right. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Right. Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s the deferred prosecution, anything with Ohio or otherwise and then ultimately your base equity as previously described? Jon Taylor : Correct. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Excellent. All right. Just actually a quick clarification FE Forward, I mean, just next steps on delineating that and just what jurisdictions if you can speak to that at all, it may just be high level corporate, but I\u2019m just curious? Steve Strah : No, it\u2019s across the entire business. I mean, it\u2019s from our utility companies, all the way to our corporate centers. So, they\u2019re in the process today of executing on all the different initiatives. We are uploading all of that into our financial plan and that will be part of our go-forward plan in the fourth quarter assuming that we get some of these things resolved. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Jon, I just have to ask in that equation that you laid out about the issuing the equity in your plan relative to asset sales. I think you mentioned potentially selling assets as saying use like a 32 multiple, is that the kind of range that there might be interest in some of these assets? Steve Strah : Well, I think we have real experience in that I think Puget just got 32 times on their transaction, Duke got 28 times, CenterPoint got 38 times. So, I mean it\u2019s in the range of what we\u2019ve seen in the industry. Steve Fleishman : And then whatever you end up selling, can you just confirm kind of on taxes, given I think your tax situation, is it likely that there be shields against any gains on a potential sale? Steve Strah : I would tell you we\u2019re working through that. We would like to structure it in a tax efficient manner. But to the extent that we can\u2019t and we do have $7 billion of NOLs that we could utilize. So, still TBD on that, but something that we\u2019re working through. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So, I guess I meant totally whether it\u2019s the transaction itself or the NOLs between the two, should there be limited taxes on potential sales whatever they are? Steve Strah : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Steve Strah : That\u2019s correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And I guess one more question just on the asset sale aspect. So, in the DPA, there is a provision on the DPA kind of, I guess, tracking with any assets that are sold or obviously any change in corporate structure. Does that impact your asset sale process at all? Steve Strah : Steve, no, it doesn\u2019t. But I\u2019m going to ask Hyun to maybe comment on that provision in the DPA. Hyun Park : Yes, Steve, this is Hyun Park, the CLOs here at FirstEnergy. So, there is a provision on mergers and changing core performance \u2013 transactions of that nature. We don\u2019t think that a minority interest in the sale of a subsidiary would trigger a provision like that. We would probably speak with the Assistant U.S. Attorneys just to make sure that we\u2019re on the same page. But that the transactions that are contemplated there, I don\u2019t think would be triggered by something like this. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just on the asset sale process, it looks like you\u2019re in advanced stages, maybe could you just highlight for us what kind of interest are you seeing, who were you having these discussions with or these strategic buyers, i.e., peer utilities or sort of private entities, any color that you could share there, please? Thank you. Steve Strah : Yes. Durgesh, it\u2019s probably a little too early to get into that level of detail. I would just tell you that the transactions that we\u2019ve seen in our space have had solid valuations, which tells me, there is a lot of interest in regulated assets and so my expectation is there is going to be a lot of interest in anything we do. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you. And then just to clarify your Ohio discussions. Right? There are a few issues there. The investigation and obviously, [technical difficulty] and amongst other things. So, I guess in these sort of the collaborative discussions you are [technical difficulty] all of those issues. Is that sort of a fair assessment on how should we \u2013 how we should think about sort of things getting resolved here going forward? Steve Strah : I would like to think about all those issues being under one umbrella. Our first meeting that we had in March, we were very careful to go in and listen to concerns, listen and get input on different things that could be done in Ohio for the benefit of customers. So, yes, I would like to put all of this under one umbrella once we reengage the collaborative and now that the DPA is behind us, I think we really do have a very good opportunity to not only listen, but then start to proceed to some level of action, it would be my greatest hope. Durgesh Chopra : I appreciate that, Steve. And then maybe just from \u2013 for us and for investors, are there sort of some milestones or timeline from this point on as these discussions evolve to watch for? Steve Strah : I want the process to unfold with the next meeting and I want to respect that process. So, my hope would be to make significant progress by the end of the year, but I do want to respect the process and that just simply mandates something. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : I\u2019m curious to hear your perspective from maybe little a bit more longer-term view. Once you put the initial equity needs behind you with potentially the sale of a stake in the business, like you described is 12% to 13% FFO to debt still a suitable long-term target or would you be inclined to maybe increase that and equitize your balance sheet little more, just maybe [indiscernible]. Steve Strah : Sophie, I think we\u2019ve talked about 12% to 13% no later than 2024. I think we would want to improve from there over time knowing that in our current business plan, probably 65% of our capex is formula rate spend, which provides incremental FFO each and every year. So, I would like to get to a spot where we\u2019re 12% to 13% and improving over the long term. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you. And then a follow-up if I may. So, you mentioned that once you have more definitive view on the potential transaction here, you would be in a position to provide a long-term outlook. And so just to make sure, we\u2019re talking about the fourth quarter of 2021, are you saying that you would be able to incorporate some of the views about your 2024 rate case in Ohio when you do that and assumptions about that proceeding sort of in your long-term outlook at that time? Steve Strah : So, I think the rate case in 2024 will probably be something that is dealt with as part of the collaborative discussion with all the parties down in Columbus. So, to the extent that we can have clarity around that then we\u2019ll obviously provide that in the fourth quarter that were the timeframe. So, I would tell you that we are open to those types of recommendations, if they \u2013 if the parties thought that we needed to come in to file a case sooner than that, I think we would be open to that and so it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be discussing I\u2019m assuming over the course of the next few months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : So, I guess this is sort of a big picture question. I don\u2019t need to tell you guys that obviously politics and money go together. It\u2019s a very political business and I understand the reforms you guys are doing and everything. But I guess what are the thoughts or concerns that might come up and how do you sort of Steve \u2013 how do you thread the needle here because on the one hand obviously makes sure \u2013 it makes sense for you guys to obviously institute reforms and everything, on the other hand, it\u2019s important right for almost all utilities to be heavily involved in the political process in the jurisdictions you guys operate in. Do you follow me, I mean, are you guys \u2013 how do \u2013 there\u2019s always a potential of sort of an overreaction if you follow what I\u2019m saying and I\u2019m looking at the actions and they seem very aggressive and understandably so to a certain degree, but how do you sort of thread the needle, do you follow what I\u2019m saying or are you guys at all concerned about that or how should we as investors think about that sort of as the years play out here about how much you guys might not be engaged as much as perhaps might be desirable? Do you follow what I am saying? SteveStrah: Yes. I appreciate your question. I think right now the best thing that we could do is what we have done and that is to hit the pause button, review and then appropriately revised our approach to everything from lobbying and the use of consultants and just take this one step at a time and thread the needle appropriately. As I\u2019ve stated before that future vision is going to be much more limited than what it has been in our past because we are moving in a very clearly different direction with integrity and trust at the center of it. The other thing that I think you can count on is robust disclosures that we\u2019ve committed to as part of the DPA and in other arenas. But look, I do understand the need to be in the arena and we will be in it, but we\u2019re going to be in it and those issues that matter to our customers and to our company and we\u2019re going to do that in a much more limited basis. So, I appreciate everybody\u2019s patience around the pause button that we hit here, but we\u2019re going to continue to just flat out do the right thing and constructing the right policy internally before we step back into the arena is the right thing to do. Paul Patterson : Okay and then just in terms of and I wasn\u2019t clear on this, I think it was Shar\u2019s question, with respect to the potential for a rate case proceeding in Ohio, was \u2013 if I just clarify, were you guys basically saying that sort of up in the air until you guys get more clarity. It\u2019s just too early to say what might actually be sort of the fallout so to speak on the PUCO disclosures and the DPA and everything else, how that might proceed or is there any more clarity, I guess, you have on that or I just want make sure I understand that? SteveStrah: Yes. Paul. So, it\u2019s too early to say, but my point was we would be open to it If that\u2019s what the parties suggested. Paul Patterson : Okay. SteveStrah: So as part of our collaborative discussions with the other parties, if there was a sense that we needed to file a case before May of 24, we would be open to that. Paul Patterson : Okay, thanks so much for your other questions that have been asked. Thanks so much. Have a great one. SteveStrah: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Thank you. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the DPA, certainly a big milestone. A lot covered in the call and we\u2019re up on the hour, so I\u2019ll keep it short, but two things I just wanted to clarify, first on the last call, you indicated that the internal investigation hadn\u2019t identified any new issues and it sounded like minimal cost for concern outside of Ohio. With the dissolution of the independent review committee, does that mean that it\u2019s basically \u2013 is the review done at this point? Is it safe to say that there\u2019s no other causes for concern beyond what\u2019s been revealed so far? SteveStrah: Well, I think in John Somerhalder\u2019s comments, he had stated that, look, we have moved to dissolve that committee and really it \u2013 we will maintain kind of behave reactive or responsive type capability and coordinate that with the SLC for any inbound additional issue. But by the dissolution of the committee itself. I think it really does represent that it\u2019s at its conclusion. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. Then as far as O&M costs, I know FE Forward, they\u2019re very impressive numbers you put out on the cash flow and capex efficiencies, remind me the O&M\u2019s also fall under FE Forward and maybe more broadly can you give your latest thinking on the outlook for operating expenses, particularly with so much learned about operations during the pandemic and finding some of the more permanent improvements in processes? SteveStrah: Yes. So, Andrew, I think as part of the FE Forward process, the goal would be to absorb any inflationary increases for the foreseeable future. So, right now, we spend about $1.25 billion on what I\u2019ll call our base O&M program between corporate and our utility group and we would expect to hold that flat over the foreseeable future through different efficiencies and transformational efforts that we identified through FE Forward. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Strah for any final comments. Steve Strah : Thank you very much and thanks for everyone being here with us today. As we described today, we continue to make solid progress to transform FirstEnergy to deliver the long-term value that our shareholders, our employees and all stakeholders seek. So, we will talk to you again very soon. And please be well and be safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Strategy. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Strah : Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter, and I'm excited to talk to you about our progress on many different fronts. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. Our operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which is above the top end of our guidance range. Our customer-focused strategies, positive mix of weather-adjusted load, great operational performance and financial discipline continue to drive solid results. Furthermore, I'm proud of our progress to resolve important legacy issues and strengthen all aspects of our company. In Ohio, we continue to take a collaborative approach, and we're engaged in settlement discussions with a broad range of parties to resolve several of our pending cases before the PUCO. Our meetings continue to be productive, and we're making good progress. We are also making progress on the Ohio corporate separation, DMR and DCR audits. The corporate separation audit report was filed on September 13 and showed no findings of major noncompliance. The expanded DCR audit report is due by November 19. And we continue to work through the DMR audit, which is now due on December 16. Since our last earnings call, we've taken additional steps to strengthen our compliance program and instill a culture focused on ethics, integrity and accountability across our organization. These include : a new Compliance & Ethics Program Charter and policies in multiple areas; instructor-led business Code of Conduct awareness training for senior leadership and individuals with significant roles in our control environment; training on the concepts of our new internal Code of Conduct for everyone in leadership, with training for all employees planned in the first quarter of 2022; and publishing our new corporate engagement report. Additionally, we have started to develop a new integrated risk management platform to enhance our ethics and compliance, audit and risk functions. The new tool will help us streamline case management of ethics and compliance concerns, manage the life cycle of corporate policies, assess and respond to risks, and report on our compliance with internal controls and regulatory requirements across the organization. As we've discussed, over the last 12 months, our Board and management team acted quickly and decisively, adding additional independent board members, making changes in our management structure, establishing effective controls, reinforcing our culture change and building a best-in-class ethics and compliance program. Our relentless focus in these areas resulted in remediation of the material weakness in internal controls associated with our tone at the top.  While this is an important step, we continue driving these cultural changes and keeping compliance and integrity at the center of everything we do. We are working every day to continue rebuilding stakeholder trust and confidence in FirstEnergy and to ensure that our employees can be proud of our company and our mission. Yesterday, we announced another key hire to enhance our leadership team. Camilo Serna will join FirstEnergy on November 8 as our new Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Camilo brings a great depth of experience, developing and implementing state and federal regulatory strategies. His experience will be invaluable as we build a smarter electric grid and support the transition to a cleaner energy future. We continue taking steps to achieve these goals. For example, last month, JCP&L submitted a proposal to PJM and the New Jersey BPU for transmission investments that would connect clean energy generated from the state's offshore wind farms to the power grid, while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. We expect a decision on this proposal, which supports the clean energy investments driven by the New Jersey Energy Master Plan in the second half of 2022. In West Virginia, we recognize our responsibility to operate our 2 regulated fossil plants for the benefit of our customers in the state. Later this year, we intend to file an effluent limitation guideline, or ELG plan, that calls for additional capital expenditures at the 2 plants to comply with environmental rules and to ensure that they can continue to operate beyond 2028. At the same time, we intend to begin discussing with stakeholders our plans for a timely clean energy transition. As a part of that transition, later this year, we plan to file with the West Virginia Public Service Commission for 50 megawatts of utility scale solar generation. Our wind connection and solar proposals support core components of our climate strategy, building a more climate-resilient energy system that meets our customers' changing needs, enables the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and powers a sustainable and prosperous future for our stakeholders. In the other recent regulatory activity, this month, our ATSI transmission subsidiary reached a settlement with parties to a FERC proceeding that will address legacy issues associated with ATSI's move from MISO to PJM in 2011 and provide for partial recovery of the MISO transmission project costs that will be allocated to ATSI in the future. It's an exciting time for our company. We have a robust long-term pipeline to modernize our transmission network, and we plan to continue embracing renewables. In our distribution business, we're incorporating emerging smart technologies and building a technologically advanced distribution platform. And our industry will play a key role in the infrastructure build-out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other technologies. We're pleased with our strong performance through the first 9 months of 2021. As we close out the year, we are raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance from $2.40 to $2.60 per share to $2.55 to $2.65 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 9% increase over 2020 operating earnings results. Finally, I can't pass the call over to Jon without acknowledging that it's been one year since I stepped into my leadership role under very sobering circumstances. It's been a challenging year on many fronts. And I want to publicly thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the grit and the resilience of the entire team. Together, we are building positive, sustainable momentum, and creating a new FirstEnergy that is a forward thinking and industry-leading company. Thank you for your attention this morning. Now Jon will provide a review of third quarter results and a financial update. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.82 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. In our distribution business, results for the third quarter of 2021 as compared to last year reflect the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenue, which totaled $0.04 per share as well as lower weather-related usage. These were partially offset by higher revenues from our capital investment programs, new rates from our JCP&L distribution base rate case and lower operating expenses. Consistent with the trends we've discussed over the last few quarters, total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2020. While weather was hotter than normal in our region this summer, it was cooler in the third quarter of 2020. Weather-adjusted residential sales for the third quarter of 2021 were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2020 as many of our customers continue to work from home. Comparing our results to the pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019, weather-adjusted residential usage was nearly 6% higher this quarter. While the commercial and industrial classes have not yet recovered to levels we saw before the pandemic, they are starting to trend in the right direction. Weather-adjusted commercial deliveries increased 3% while industrial load was up nearly 4% compared to the third quarter of 2020. Industrial load increased in most of the sectors in our service territory this quarter, led by steel, chemical and fabricated metal. In our regulated transmission business, we continue to see benefits from higher transmission investments at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries as part of our Energizing the Future program. However, this was offset by higher interest from the debt issuance at FET earlier this year and a prior year formula rate true-up. And in the Corporate segment, results reflect lower O&M and benefit expenses. For the first 9 months of 2021, operating earnings were $2.10 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the first 9 months of 2020. The increase was driven by our ongoing investments in our distribution and transmission systems, higher weather-related usage and lower expenses. These items more than offset the $0.17 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues recognized in the first 9 months of 2020. Our strong results and financial discipline have resulted in year-to-date adjusted cash from operations of $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of $600 million versus last year. While we expect a few offsets in the fourth quarter, we now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.8 billion for the year, which includes approximately $300 million of investigation and other related costs, the largest of which is associated with the $230 million EPA settlement. Earlier this month, we successfully restructured our revolving credit facilities from a 2-facility model to 6, fulfilling our commitment to complete this action before the end of the year. The 2021 credit facilities provide for aggregate commitments of $4.5 billion and are available until October of 2026, with 2 separate 1-year extensions. The credit facilities and their sublimits are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights. We are also pleased that following the restructuring of these facilities, S&P issued a one notch upgrade to the 10 distribution companies and the 3 transmission companies. While we're glad to return to investment-grade ratings for these companies with all 3 rating agencies, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet and the overall credit profile at the parent company. We previously communicated that we were targeting FFO to debt in the 12% to 13% range. We're raising that target to be solidly at 13%, which will provide ample cushion to the new Moody's threshold of 12%. And we expect to set the company on a firm glide path to mid-teens. On a number of recent calls, we've communicated that we're contemplating a minority asset sale as we consider alternatives to raise equity capital. Currently, we are engaged in a process to sell a minority interest in our transmission holding company, FirstEnergy Transmission, which owns ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo. The interest is very strong and preliminary indications are very supportive of our financial plan and targets. But given where we are in the process, we can't comment any further on the details. We continue to evaluate all options to raise equity capital in an efficient manner to support our longer-term outlook, which includes traditional rate base growth and formula rate investments, planned rate case activity, and incremental and strategic CapEx that supports the transition to a cleaner electric grid. We are optimistic that we'll be in a position to share our overall financing plan and our longer-term outlook within the next couple of weeks. In fact, you may have noticed that we've expanded the information in the appendix of our strategic and financial highlights document. Given the current status of the proposed asset sale, we recognize that the fact book will be more relevant once we can include the outcome from that transaction. During the fourth quarter, we expect to provide you with 2022 guidance and a detailed capital plan, along with the runway of our FFO-to-debt target, longer-term capital forecasts, and targeted rate base and earnings growth rates. As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just wanted to talk about kind of current results and operations here. How should we be thinking about some of these items that have come in ahead of plan this year that helped you raise the guidance? And should we think about these items as sustainable into the future? Or just trying to get a sense for how much might have been weather or other impacts. Steven Strah : I think that's a very good question. And as all of the U.S. and worldwide, we're still adjusting to the impacts of the pandemic. And with regard to that, the impact on our business plan, we see residential loads not only increased over the year, but we see that as an ongoing trend as we get back to whatever will be called the new normal in the U.S. So based on the impact of residential load on our earnings, we see that as promising as we kind of work through the process of getting back to normal. Our commercial and industrial loads, they're basically demand-based. And we see commercial and industrial coming back to normal slowly. But right now, we're trying to figure out whether or not they'll get to pre-pandemic levels. So that's kind of the ongoing assumptions that we're working on. And at the end, we're just going to have to see how we end up getting through the Delta variant, the pandemic and getting everybody back to work over time. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe diving into Ohio a little bit more here. Just wondering if you could give any more color on the Ohio settlement discussions. How are they looking at this stage? And I guess what kind of plays into your confidence in being able to provide kind of a long-term update in the near future here? Steven Strah : Well, thanks for that question, too. In terms of Ohio, we're very encouraged by the progress that we've made thus far. It's been a productive, constructive and collaborative approach. And that's the tone that myself and the management team wanted to set as we get about the prospects for a settlement. And we feel as though those prospects are very good right now. I want to ensure that we keep the integrity of the process together so I don't want to get too far ahead in terms of commenting on it. But we're achieving a new and different tone, which I think is resonating. And our goal is to continue to remove, where we can, investor uncertainty in Ohio and derisk some of those concerns in a way. The ongoing effort by our management team is to continue to promote stability and predictability, and that's going to start in Ohio for us. So we're going to keep working on it. We'll keep you updated in terms of our progress. And once again, I'm encouraged. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yes. I guess on the same topic of the last question. I just wanted to clarify that you're not going to give the '22 and long-term guidance until the Ohio kind of that rate process is -- settlement talk process is resolved? Jon Taylor : Yes, Steve. This is Jon. That's our preference, obviously. We want to try to get clarity around where we're going to be with Ohio. So we -- like Steve said, we're working as hard as we can to get to a resolution on this issue. As we talked about, the collaborative nature of the meetings and the discussions has been very productive, but we're not there yet. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then on the issue of it, it sounds like we'll get something relatively soon on the asset sale you identified. You did mention that you continue to look for kind of all efficient ways to raise equity capital. Is there other asset sales or equity or other things that you're also considering? Or is it still -- is it mainly really focused on this asset sale process? Jon Taylor : So Steve, I would tell you that the process for FET is going very well. We're very happy with what we're seeing. The interest is very strong. The preliminary indications on valuations are very supportive of our financial goals. And it's better than the messaging than we've talked about before. But we're not done, and we have some work to do on that process. I just think, for us, it's important that we continue to think through how to best position the company going forward and ensure we have financial flexibility to support incremental and strategic CapEx, such as formula rate CapEx. So we continue to think through different alternatives to accomplish this. And my sense is we'll be in a position sometime in the next few weeks to give you an update on that. Steven Fleishman : That sounds great. And that's great on FET. Just one other question on the new balance sheet metric targets, the 13% FFO to debt. Is there a rough sense of how long it would take to kind of get to that level? Jon Taylor : So I think we need to work through Ohio and where we're going to be there. But my sense is we could be there by the end of '23, maybe first part of '24. But I think we need to get through a few things, and then we'll be able to provide you a better outlook on timing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well done on the updates. Do you expect that the minority sale of FET will satisfy all of the equity needs from '22 through, say, '25? And just to clarify from earlier, are the indicative valuations still comparable to the PE multiples that you previously discussed on prior earnings calls? Jon Taylor : Yes. To answer that question, comparable and better. So that should hopefully give you a sense of what we're looking at. But we're still in the middle of the process, so there's still a lot of work to do there. And as I just told Steve, I think everything is on the table in terms of the go-forward plan. And so we continue to think through how to best position the company going forward. And like I said, I think we'll be able to communicate our plan in the next few weeks. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No. I hear you. And again, kind of riffing off the last set of questions too here. If I can, with respect to the long-term guidance, is your objective to set an EPS CAGR with '22 as a base year? I would presume, yes, but I just want to clarify that. And critically, prior to the Ohio DPA, you previously characterized your EPS growth outlook as generally consistent with the industry average. Is that still a fair aspiration, both as a base year and the prospective target thereafter? Jon Taylor : Yes. So I think we'll be in a position to give you targeted rate base and earnings growth rates. We'll give you '22 guidance. We'll give you '22 cash flow, '22 capital and then high-level capital plan for our planning horizon. So I think we'll be able to give you that kind of look in the next few weeks. And the answer to your second question is yes. I mean if you just look at our earnings year-over-year this year, it's at 9%. Recall we even backed down on some capital this year. So my sense is we'll have normal utility growth. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. That's great. And then just to clarify, sorry, just a finer point here. In Ohio, are some of the audit proceedings gating items, if you will, for a settlement? I mean you pointed to this mid-December data point on the auto report, for instance. Steven Strah : Yes. I would say, Julien, I would think of our settlement discussions that we're having right now separate from the 4 audits that are ongoing. And if you'll recall, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, the corporate separation, the rider DMR, we look at political and charitable spending and rider DCR, each one of those audits are on their own way right now. We're working very hard and have been very open, very responsive to the work that's going on there. When you start to look at the settlement issue, that's more along the lines of the quadrennial review that we talked about in our prepared remarks and other items. So we're kind of working all the proceedings together. And once again, we're being as open and transparent as we can as we kind of walk that path with our regulators and other interested parties in Ohio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Steve, I just want to -- just on Ohio. I know you obviously had some comments about removing concerns and thinking about predictability. I understand, obviously, you guys are in discussions, and it's sensitive, right? But curious if any of the discussions also entail maybe how to think about the construct on a more prospective basis, like maybe different rate mechanisms, PBRs, how to think about a future GRC or not. Steven Strah : I think that's a very good question. I think we have started this entire process. And our approach as a company is really starting with a listening tour, if you will. So we're listening. And we're not missing anything that we're getting in terms of our feedback from our past endeavors. And we're trying to apply some lessons into the future. So to the extent Ohio or other jurisdictions, regulators or other interested parties have new and different ways to look at the future, we are certainly open to that. So I think we've explored that entire territory presently in Ohio, and we're going to remain open to that. And I don't want to kind of open the door too far to what we're attempting to do in Columbus right now. But once again, I'm encouraged that all the parties are meeting around the common table for the common good. And for us, that's keeping the customer at the center of that equation. And we've been encouraged by that. So once again, it's around openness and just being able to think differently than what we have had in the past. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. And then just -- it sounds like your balance sheet and metrics are improving a lot. So other than the sort of the TransCo stake sale, how do you strategically think about the assets that you may be able to further optimize versus what's absolutely core? This is obviously especially in light of a recent peer announcing the deal to sell a utility in a relatively heavy coal burning state. I guess, Jon, do you see some incremental value to further simplify sell coal and redeploying to renewables, especially as those decarbonization plans come to fruition in several states, right, which may have their own kind of financing? Steven Strah : Yes. Well, Shar, I'll take the first cut at that. And if you don't mind, I'll turn it over to Jon. But at the end, when we look at our current opportunity, we've got all the pieces in front of us and we're evaluating all of our options. In terms of our prepared remarks and what Jon has shared, we feel as though we have the right strategic options in front of us right now. And we are not taking anything unnecessarily off the table. But at the end, we think we're in a very good place where we can propel this company forward and do that without sacrificing what I believe is a very strong footprint, a very strong business plan and a very strong strategy as being a pure-play T&D kind of regulated environment. And we feel very good about that presently in terms of what we've expressed publicly. And we're just going to continue to work our plan right now. Jon, I don't know if you have anything to add there. Jon Taylor : Yes. Shar, I would just say, as we thought about all of our different assets before we started the process with FET, we thought about, one, making sure that we could raise equity in an efficient manner for our shareholders. I think FET is going to definitely check that box. But just as important is a business that we could attract sophisticated high-quality investors where we can align on governance and business strategy type of issues. And I think from where we are today, FET meets all those criteria for us. It's going to be a very efficient capital raise. It will be accretive to earnings. The investors that are in the mix are top-notch quality firms. And they're very supportive of the business plan and very supportive of future transmission opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Agnie Storozynski : Just one follow-up on the transmission business. So one, the earnings power of this business this year is a bit lower than we expected. And I hear the explanation behind some true-up, but -- cost true-up. But if you could just give me a bit more sense into that earnings range, the updated earnings range. Also, given that you're selling a stake in that business, what happens -- is there any condition assigned to that sale in case there is a reduction in the allowed ROE for these assets in light of the RTO adder likely going away? Jon Taylor : Yes. So Angie, I'll try to take both of those. So just in the transmission business, year-over-year, our investment program has added about $0.05 in earnings through September. Now that was offset with some additional interest expense from our revolver borrowings earlier this year as well as the long-term debt issuance at FET back in, I think, the March time frame. And then we had those, what I'll call, $0.02 of formula rate true-ups, where really -- those are accounting true-ups of a prior year forward-looking rate. We typically use projected rate base, and we true that up to actuals in the following year. And a lot of that is associated with deferred taxes and the like. So those are your primary drivers. We continue to be very optimistic about our Energizing the Future program. And it provides a lot of opportunity for us to grow this company in the future. With respect to your second question, I think that's too early to tell and some details that we probably don't want to get into at this point in time. But once we have clarity in all of that, we'll obviously provide that to you. Steven Strah : Yes. I think, Jon, that's right on target. I would just add that it's more than that for us as a company in terms of an investment opportunity. It's around the value the customer sees. And we've been able to demonstrate as we invest in transmission that reliability has continued to improve, and that's very important for us as it is obviously for our customers. So we try to keep that firmly in play in terms of the equation. Agnie Storozynski : Okay. Just one follow-up. So you -- I mean, we -- I think we all had expected an announcement on the asset sales pretty much right now. So is there -- are you waiting to see how big a stake of FET you need to sell based on the future distribution earnings power in Ohio? Jon Taylor : No. No, Angie. I mean, we're just working the process. I mean, we launched the process earlier this year, and it just takes some time. We're not going to make a decision on something that significant just to communicate it on an earnings call. We want to make sure that we do it right and that we have the right structure in place, and we're just following our process. Agnie Storozynski : Okay. And just one last one. So I appreciate the disclosures on the -- or somewhat disclosures on the earnings growth. Can you comment about your ability to grow the dividend given this 13% FFO-to-debt target? Steven Strah : Yes. Well, Angie, we certainly understand the importance of the dividend, its placement within our business plan. And we know how important it really is. Currently, our approach remains unchanged. Our payout range is 55% to 65%. If you were to take a gauge of it right now, we have a potential to be within that 60% range with a 4% yield. And obviously, I don't want to get ahead of our Board of Directors. Our Board reviews this on a routine basis. And I would just say, Jon has done a very good job of talking about some of the key pieces that are in front of us right now. The clarity in Ohio that we're seeking, and that I'm confident we'll get to here, along with the potential for a minority stake sale in transmission. And it's our ongoing quest to get to that investment-grade level that we're working towards. And once again and just to reiterate, we are working towards a 13% FFO-to-debt ratio to put balance sheet concerns beyond us. So we've got some wood to chop, so to speak, and we're working our process right now. And a dividend discussion is obviously ongoing with our Board as we move ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Jon, I hate to go back to the 2022 guidance and forward-looking projections. Can you just clarify how many years' worth of CapEx guidance are you going to give us? Jon Taylor : Yes. I think we'll probably give you a 3- to 4-year look on CapEx. So '22 to '25, something like that is probably what we're thinking. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Great. And then just in terms of your equity needs, you previously talked about $600 million a year. Is that a good sort of cadence as we sort of think about your financing needs through 2025? Jon Taylor : Well, so I think we've talked about looking at alternatives in lieu of those equity issuances. And so that's why we've been looking at the minority interest sale at FET and considering other alternatives. So I think we'll be able to give you the longer-term look once we get some clarity on a few things. But I think what we're considering now is in lieu of those issuances in '22 and '23. Durgesh Chopra : Right. Sure, sure. I'm just trying to see -- okay, so I guess another way to ask this question is, I'm trying to see how much -- what's the dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale that you reached? So I was just trying to see what are the needs in the base plan. And I was trying to sort of peg it to $600 million a year. That's sort of where I was going with this. Jon Taylor : Yes. So I don't know if I can give you all those details right now. I think we need to probably wait until we get some clarity in Ohio. And obviously, we want to be able to articulate to our investors our plan to get to 13%. We also want to think through, ensuring that we have financial flexibility for additional CapEx, specifically formula rate CapEx. So as we think about our overall plan, we'll put all of that into the mix and provide you a longer-term outlook, including our financing plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Congrats on a good 9 months. I actually have a couple little unrelated to each other. First of all, New Jersey. Your data shows you're under-earning in New Jersey by a couple of hundred basis points. Can you talk with us about your efforts to improve that, to get back closer to authorized? That's question A. Question B, more longer term. When you think about capital spend opportunities, call it, next 2 to 4 years or so, somewhere in there, where do you think the greatest opportunity to deploy more capital is outside of the offshore winds related transmission across the system? Like what type of projects? What type of opportunities? Steven Strah : Yes. Michael, this is Steve. I'll take the second half of that question. And look, I believe that we're in a great spot as a company to not only continue our plan in terms of fortifying the transmission and distribution business that we have before us with very good classic investments, I would call it, to improve customer reliability, while maintaining very affordable rates is kind of number one. So I see that moving ahead. Beyond the offshore wind, I believe, as we seek and end up receiving greater clarity on the clean energy transition that the U.S. is going to continue to move ahead on, I think that's going to provide us great opportunities both in the T&D environment to continue to invest and embrace renewables. And we're certainly very excited about that opportunity. Beyond that, it's also taking emerging technologies that are coming towards us that are much more affordable for customers, such as smart meter and other items, in which we're going to prepare a T&D platform for renewables over time. And I think those opportunities not only exist on the transmission system, but they exist in each one of our jurisdictions. So I think it's very -- we've talked about this before. It's very important that we keep the customer in the center of that equation in which we can enrich the value we're providing them, but we keep affordability in mind. So we can get into more details over time about individual initiatives that we could pursue. But once again, I think we have a very great in that realm. Relative to JCP&L, I think I'll turn that portion of the question over to Jon. Jon Taylor : Yes, Michael. So we started the year, if you recall, at probably around a 6.5% return on equity in New Jersey for 2020. We implemented the base distribution case 1/1 of this year. And so we've gone from 6.5% to 8.2% in terms of the ROE. And my sense is that will continue to increase as we roll on the full 12 months of the base distribution case. I think you'll always be a little bit below your allowed return on equity there just because of regulatory lag, but we should be closer to that in the fourth quarter. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one follow-up. Can you remind me, in Pennsylvania, are you currently benefiting from the DISC? And are there any issues with the kind of getting DISC-related revenue increases, small though they'd be, in the near term? Jon Taylor : Yes. DISC revenue is turned on, with the exception of Penn Power, and we're working through a little bit of an issue there with some cost recovery. But for the other 3 companies, the DISC revenue is turned on. Michael Lapides : You're getting annual rate increases tied to the DISC even though they're not really big numbers? Jon Taylor : Correct, correct. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : I have two questions. I have two questions about the transmission CapEx. First one is, I know you trimmed it earlier this year in April. And at the time, you referenced some uncertainty about the DOJ investigation as well as the balance sheet constraints. Do you see opportunity to reverse those cuts? Or should we think of those as more permanent? And then the second question is, if you do move forward with the sale of minority interest in the business, would that impact the CapEx plans longer term? Or do you think that's unrelated to the ownership? Steven Strah : Yes, Andrew, I'll give you my cut at that. And the way I like to think about that is, look, our company has faced significant uncertainty in the last 18-month period. And we've done what is prudent in terms of just ensuring that we can maintain financial flexibility in the present tense and then increase it in the future tense, if you will. And I think we've done a very good job of managing that. I believe our transmission investment opportunities, while we curtailed them slightly this year, I think you'll see us continue to ramp that up incrementally just to make sure also that we stay within our sweet spot within that. In other words, we don't want to go too far in terms of burdening customers in terms of cost. But once again, we are seeing continued reliability improvement. So I think that's really important for us. When you factor in the potential for a minority stake sale within the transmission business, I think that's only going to, if executed, fortify our company moving ahead, strengthen our business platform, strengthen our balance sheet. And I think that will provide a greater opportunity to invest into the future. And once again, I think all of these pieces, while we can't be more definitive today, I think they're starting to align nicely. Not only the minority stake consideration working towards some type of settlement in Ohio that once again will help our business and relieve some level of uncertainty out in the market, I think all of these pieces are starting to work forward very nicely. Our main concern is we continue to do that is -- just to make sure that we keep our company between the guardrail, so to speak. We have to continue to execute. We've got to continue to keep our employees and the public safe, be concerned with our reliability, ensure that financially that we're performing not only for shareholders, but all stakeholders. And we feel very good about where we're at right now, even though, as I said earlier, we have work to do. Operator : At this time, we have reached the end of the question-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Strah for closing comments. Steven Strah : Great. Well, thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very proud about the progress that we've made to transform not only our business, but our culture as a company. And that will remain front and center for me as CEO. We're continuing to achieve our financial, customer service and ESG goals. We have more work to do. But I am very confident that we're going to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders, employees, our customers and our communities that we serve. So we look forward to talking to many of you at EEI. And I just wish all of you and your families continued safety and great health as we continue to work through this pandemic. So with that, all the best, and thank you once again for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today\u2019s discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website. We will begin today\u2019s call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Strah : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. I am glad you could join us and we have a lot of ground to cover. Over the past year, our Board, leadership team and employees have worked together to dramatically reshape FirstEnergy. We have embraced important foundational changes to strengthen our culture and the core of our company. We are optimizing our operations through our transformational FE Forward initiative and we bolstered our financial position to enable long-term strategic investments to modernize the electric grid and to deliver a superior customer experience. I am extremely proud of our progress. This important work together with our continued strong operational performance is energizing our company. Our efforts in 2021 were the first steps on a journey to transform FirstEnergy into a more sustainable company, centered on our core values and built for the long term. While the deferred prosecution agreement, the approved Ohio settlement and the progress we announced yesterday in resolving outstanding litigation are all very important milestones, most of our significant work over the past year involves the cultural changes at our company. So I\u2019d like to start by talking about that. We are building a culture where all of us at every level in the organization feel valued and understand the importance of doing what is right. This means doing what is in the best interest of our stakeholders as well as the environment, working as one team across the company and developing an inclusive and safe culture where employees feel empowered and motivated to speak up and bring their very best everyday. This culture change is the foundation, the heart, if you will, of a new FirstEnergy and I am deeply committed to making this change. My vision is to be a company that all stakeholders trust that is focused on delivering value to our customers and where employees bring an innovative and continuous improvement mindset to work everyday. Fulfilling this vision starts with our people. Through all of the tribulations over the past 2 years, our employees have risen to every challenge and shown true character. They have delivered strong results while demonstrating a passion for what they do and a passion for serving customers. They deeply care about the communities we serve and they have a strong sense of pride for this company. But we know that pride was eroded by what happened related to House Bill 6. I, along with the Board and the entire management team, am dedicated to restoring their pride by building a company that is grounded in an unwavering culture of compliance, ethics, integrity and accountability at every level. People are our greatest asset and through our employee-driven FE Forward program, we are implementing their ideas and solutions to create value for our company, our customers and other stakeholders. By investing $150 million in innovation, digital tools and technologies, we can work more safely and efficiently, deliver an exceptional experience for customers, and unlock opportunities for growth that are embedded in the broad energy transition. For example, our employees have determined that we can better serve our customers through a 5-state operating model with centrally driven best practices and processes as opposed to separate operating company management teams. And last week, we made that transition. Employees are implementing enhanced communications and self-service options to improve the experience for customers when they need our assistance. They are using data and analytics to drive better decisions around our assets, sourcing and inventory, resulting in better reliability for customers and they are capturing productivity improvements through system integration, automation and mobility tools that will significantly reduce day-to-day work we outsourced currently. This is important work and coupled with our investments in a more modern and sustainable grid, we expect it to completely transform our company inside and out. We are enabling this transformation in part through an innovation center and digital factory. These functions, which will be staffed by over 140 professionals, are focused on enhancing the use of technology across our company. Together with IT and cyber and physical security, they are now led by our new Chief Information Officer, Steve Fortune, who joined us this week. Steve was formerly Group CIO at BP, where he led a major digital transformation. We are fortunate to be able to bring him on board. We recognize this is a journey, and I am sure we will face challenges along the way, but I am confident in our team\u2019s ability to execute and meet our commitments as they did through 2021. Now, let\u2019s spend a few moments on recent developments. First, in November, we announced a $3.4 billion transformational equity financing with two premier global infrastructure funds, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners. Blackstone purchased $1 billion in FirstEnergy common stock at $39.08 per share in a transaction that closed in December. As part of that investment, Blackstone has appointed Sean Klimczak, to serve as a board observer and we expect to nominate a director candidate recommended by Blackstone in our 2022 Shareholder Meeting. Brookfield is purchasing a 19.9% stake in FET, which owns our ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo transmission companies. With an investment of $2.4 billion, this transaction represents a historic valuation in our industry. We expect that transaction to close in the second quarter. These strategic financings address all our equity needs, will strengthen our financial position, and support the incremental investment opportunities in our plan, focused on sustainable investments that support the energy transition. We are pleased to be a partner with these experienced and capable infrastructure investors who fully support the execution and acceleration of our current business strategy and transformation. Notably, these transactions demonstrate confidence in our business plan, our talented team and our vision for long-term growth. They are also a key catalyst to executing our strategy for long-term 6% to 8% customer focused growth. Also in November, we were pleased to reach a unanimous settlement with a broad range of parties on multiple Ohio proceedings that were under consideration by the Public Utilities Commission. The $306 million settlement, which was approved by the PUCO in December, benefits our Ohio customers provides clarity around a wide range of topics and demonstrates our commitment to working openly and collaboratively with our stakeholders. We also continue to make substantial progress in resolving outstanding litigation in order to provide certainty to stakeholders and focus our attention on the future. We announced yesterday that in conjunction with the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors, the company agreed to a settlement to resolve multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits in Ohio. Because the shareholder derivative suits brought on behalf of the company and for the company\u2019s benefit, the settlement includes a payment to FirstEnergy of $180 million less plaintiff\u2019s legal fees to be paid by insurance. The settlement also stipulates a series of corporate governance enhancements, which are outlined in the press release we issued yesterday and complement the substantial actions we have taken as a company to strengthen our governance and compliance program over the last 1.5 years. Upon court approval, this settlement fully resolves the derivative actions. The settlement contains provisions for enhanced oversight and disclosure of political activities, third-party audits and action plans and a review of the current executive team to be conducted by a special board committee and further alignment of financial incentives of senior executives with compliance measures. Additionally, 6 members of the Board who have served for a minimum of 5 years will not stand for reelection at the company\u2019s 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting. On behalf of the company, we thank these directors for their commitment and years of service to FirstEnergy. I will also note we have been evaluating various options to reduce the size of the Board, following the addition of 7 new directors in 2021, with an eighth from Blackstone to be appointed at this year\u2019s annual meeting. The Board will continue to comprise an impressive mix of skills, focus areas and perspectives as it guides our company through the next phase of our growth. Turning to other regulatory matters, there has also been progress on the Ohio expanded DCR audit, the DMR audit and the corporate separation audit. The audit reports have been filed in all of these cases and will continue to work through the regulatory process on each. During our third quarter call in late October, we alluded to two forthcoming filings in West Virginia that support the transition to clean energy. In November, we filed with the West Virginia Public Service Commission, a plan to build 50 megawatts of utility scale solar generation in the state at a total cost of approximately $100 million. And in December, we filed a plan to comply with environmental rules and responsibly operate our two remaining fossil plants for the benefit of West Virginia customers beyond 2028. We intend to begin a broad stakeholder dialogue regarding our planned operational end dates of 2035 and 2040 for Fort Martin and Harrison respectively, which further supports our climate goals. We will also begin preparing for future rate case activity including base rate case filings in 2023 for Maryland, West Virginia and likely New Jersey. And in 2024 for Ohio as well as the Ohio Company\u2019s filing to address the end of their current ESP, which expires in May of 2024. Also in 2022, we will continue our focus on ethics and compliance. These priorities include : Continuing to build a more centralized and robust compliance organization for updating and refining our processes, policies and controls; creating multiple channels for incident reporting; and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address incidence of misconduct; seeking continuous improvement by monitoring, benchmarking and obtaining an independent assessment of the program; and completing the training for all employees on our new code of conduct, and rolling out additional training on our speak-up culture and compliance. Finally, our ongoing commitment to creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment is an essential part of our overall cultural transformation taking place at our company. I am determined to build on our progress in this area. This is a time of historic change at FirstEnergy, change for the better. As we look to the future, I believe our company will emerge as a premier utility and a leader in our industry. And I believe we can deliver value to our investors that mirrors the value we provide to customers. In all my years at First Energy, I\u2019ve never been more excited about what\u2019s to come. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jon for a financial update. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m also excited about our future and the significant progress we\u2019ve made to place FirstEnergy in a solid financial position. As I discussed, we have a lot of moving parts this year as we absorb the Ohio settlement, certain accounting changes and begin to deploy the proceeds from the equity financings that we announced last year. As we integrate these elements into our financial plan, 2022 will be a baseline for strong long-term growth. As always, we provide materials on our website to supplement our discussion today. The fact book has been refreshed to include additional information about our company strategy and our financial plan through 2025. While we don\u2019t plan to publish the fact book quarterly in 2022, we will expand the quarterly strategic and financial highlights deck to also include updates on our strategic priorities. Now let\u2019s take a look at the financial results we reported yesterday. Since we have so much to cover, I\u2019ll keep this part of our discussion a little shorter than normal. Yesterday, we announced 2021 fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.77 per share and operating earnings of $0.51 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance, despite incredibly mild fourth quarter weather. There were several special items for the quarter, including a $0.47 per share mark-to-market gain on our pension due mainly to a higher discount rate, as well as a $0.22 per share regulatory charge resulting from refunds to customers under our Ohio PUCO settlement and a recent order in Pennsylvania to refund additional tax benefits. In our distribution business, fourth quarter results increased as a result of new base rates in New Jersey and higher revenues from capital investment programs. Fourth quarter earnings also improved over last year from the absence of the charge we took in 2020 related to our strategic decision to forgo collection of loss distribution revenues in Ohio. Also impacting the quarter was lower customer demand and higher operating expenses associated with strategic investments made to enhance reliability for customers. For the quarter, total distribution deliveries increased about 1% on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher industrial and commercial usage was partially offset by a 2% reduction in the higher-margin residential customer class. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, weather-adjusted demand continues to be strong with our residential customers, reflecting a 4% increase for the year. And although industrial and commercial customer demand continues to be lower than we saw in 2019, we have seen incremental improvement each quarter of 2021. And our fourth quarter results reflect industrial and commercial demand down just under 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. In our regulated transmission business, earnings were consistent with our updated forecast, benefiting from higher rate base related to our Energizing the Future investment program, but this was more than offset primarily by higher net financing costs and other charges. And in our corporate segment, our results for the fourth quarter reflect lower operating expenses and higher discrete income tax benefits as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year, we reported GAAP earnings of $2.35 a share and operating earnings of $2.60 a share, which is at the midpoint of the range we provided last fall, representing a 9% increase compared to 2020 operating earnings of $2.39 a share. Our strong financial performance also resulted in $2.8 billion in cash from operations last year, which was $200 million more than our original cash from operations guidance and above the midpoint of the revised guidance range we provided on our third quarter call in October, and also reflects over $300 million of nonrecurring cash payments such as the penalty under our deferred prosecution agreement. Last fall, we outlined our $17 billion sustainable investment plan through 2025, which includes our $3.3 billion investment plan this year, encompassing grid modernization resiliency, energy efficiency, enabling the energy transition and base reliability improvements. We expect these investments to not only drive our 68% growth rate but help us emerge as a leader in the energy transition. We also plan to make further improvements to our balance sheet this year. On January 20, we redeemed $850 million of holding company debt and plan to retire another $500 million in holdco debt expiring later this year. We have begun to recapitalize certain of our operating companies to fund their capital programs and improve their credit profiles. For instance, we recently issued redemption notices for $150 million and $25 million of operating company debt at CEI and Toledo Edison, respectively. We also plan to recapitalize certain other companies later this year to fund growth and enhanced credit metrics and capital structures as we plan to be much more active with rate proceedings in the future. For 2021, our CFO to adjusted debt, as defined by Moody\u2019s, was 11.5%. This excludes the one-time non-recurring payments, I mentioned earlier and that\u2019s our $1.5 billion cash position with debt. We are pleased with our progress and we remain well-positioned to achieve 13% CFO to debt by 2024. As we consider the full deployment of the proceeds from the equity transactions, we will remain flexible considering market conditions to optimize our balance sheet and to fund our capital programs, including further reducing balance sheet debt at our holding company, optimizing utility capital structures to fund capital programs or voluntary pension contributions. Our qualified pension status has improved to 83% funded given the current interest rate environment. As Steve discussed, FE Forward is transforming our organization and setting the stage for us to deliver a superior customer experience. In 2021, we achieved $300 million in total cash flow improvements from the program, compared to our original expectation of $240 million. This included $170 million in net CapEx efficiencies, along with $130 million in working capital improvements. As we look through 2025, we anticipate cash flow improvements to fund $1.6 billion in sustainable investments in our distribution business to support the energy transition while keeping customer rates affordable. Steve touched on several of our FE Forward focus areas, and I\u2019d like to expand on one more. As we all know, unprecedented supply chain issues have impacted virtually all industries throughout the pandemic. We have successfully served our customers and continued our infrastructure investment programs despite these challenges. However, through FE Forward, we are investing in our supply chain function to drive more integrated and strategic sourcing, improved market intelligence, resulting in better pricing decisions and to optimize performance in terms and conditions with our suppliers. We have also integrated our warehouse and inventory management group into our procurement function to complement our demand management forecasting with long-term purchasing decisions. By leveraging technologies and investing in resources, we\u2019re streamlining our processes, achieving cost savings and better cash flow and working to mitigate risk the entire industry is experiencing. While FE Forward is focused on transformation and innovation, we are seeing efficiencies in our operating and maintenance activities, which will provide for flexibility with our operating costs. In fact, from our 2022 base O&M of $1.4 billion, we anticipate that FE Forward will naturally reduce O&M levels at least 1% annually starting in 2023. This will afford added flexibility to be strategic with O&M as we were in 2021 and will also mitigate the impact on customer rates as we think about future rate cases. We recognize that we have a lot of moving parts this year. However, by applying the same focus that has changed our company for the better over the past 12 months, I\u2019m confident we will continue to implement the plans we\u2019ve outlined and further transform our company into an industry leader. At the same time, we will deliver on our financial commitments, including achieving our 2022 operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 a share, with growth of 6% to 8% thereafter, delivering on our 2022 cash from operations target of $2.6 billion to $3 billion, and growing operating cash flow consistent with earnings over the planning period. Executing our $17 billion investment plan, which includes $3.3 billion of investments in 2022, maintaining our anticipated annual dividend rate of $1.56 a share this year with the objective to grow the dividend within our payout ratio as earnings increase consistent with our plan, successfully closing on the FET minority interest sale, and finally, making progress toward improving our balance sheet and strengthening the credit profile of FirstEnergy, as we work to reach 13% FFO to debt by 2024, with mid-teens thereafter. Before we open the line for questions, I want to thank you for your time and your interest in the company. We are proud to be building a long-term, sustainable company and culture centered on our core values and the vision Steve shared with you today. I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lapides : Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just curious, how do you think about bracketing the potential for O&M cost cuts? Meaning is the 1% a year kind of a guideline level, or do you think you can actually achieve more than that? And can you give a little more detail on where in the business you think it is that you are going to get those cost cuts? Is it supply chain, or is it across a lot of different functions? Jon Taylor : Yes, Michael, this is Jon. Thanks for the question. So, if you think about where we are for 2022 with $1.4 billion of operating costs, about 60% of that is labor. The other 40% is materials and contractors that we have on the property to supplement our labor force field work. And so as we think about O&M reductions through the FE Forward program and productivity improvements, that\u2019s going to optimize, obviously, how we backfill attrition. But more importantly, it\u2019s going to eliminate external contract needs. And we anticipate improved productivity through all the different initiatives that we are working through somewhere in the 20% to 25% range in field operations. Another example that we are working through is around our asset repair, replace decision and using better data and analytics to drive better decisions. And we are piloting a few programs now. We have done some benchmarking, and we think we can get 30% more efficient in those types of programs in terms of how we deploy resources. And then finally, we are modernizing our customer group, making it more automated, making it more user-friendly with customer self-service options and the like, which will significantly reduce the number of manual transactions that our call centers take today by up to 40%. So, it\u2019s improved productivity, it\u2019s mostly around driving contractors off the property, but also it will help us maintain staffing levels with our attrition. Michael Lapides : Got it. Hey Jon, one other follow-up. Just curious, I noticed in the slide deck, you are talking about kind of a wave of rate cases next year. Any potential change in kind of the structural regulation you are expecting, meaning any efforts to get things like more trackers or forward-looking rate making in places like West Virginia? Jon Taylor : I think it\u2019s just going to be a traditional base rate case. We have the veg management program in West Virginia. New Jersey is an area that I think we need to address the level of deferred storm costs that we have on the balance sheet. Today, we have over $300 million of storm costs that we need to collect. So, there will be something that we need to address there through some type of mechanism. But I think for the most part, these are going to be traditional base rate cases. And we will try to continue with the riders that we have in place in each of those jurisdictions. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jon. Much appreciate the guides. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David Arcaro : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe touch on right now kind of how you are prioritizing use of capital that you generate, the $5.5 billion that the plant generates over the next 5 years priorities for deploying that capital and when you might kind of stage and make those decisions? Jon Taylor : Sorry, can you repeat your question? I wasn\u2019t sure I totally understood that. David Arcaro : Sure. So, over the course of the plan, there is about $5.5 billion of cash that you are generating. And you have mentioned dividend growth, minority interest distributions. Just wondering if there are kind of priorities for how you plan to allocate that capital and make strategic decisions around it? Jon Taylor : Yes. No, I understand now. Yes. So, if you look at our \u2013 just our high-level financing plan, if you do the capital program with our cash from operations and our planned financings, there is going to be a pool of cash left over of $5.5 billion. About \u2013 there is going to be a portion of that will obviously fund dividends and dividend growth as we look to the future. But there will be a portion of that is available to us, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that we will remain flexible on either to find additional CapEx, de-lever the balance sheet or make pension contributions. David Arcaro : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I am just curious on timing of how that might play out over the next several years when you might be kind of able to take some of those initiatives? Jon Taylor : Yes. So, my sense is we are going to try to close on the FET transaction sometime in the second quarter, will obviously take some time to assess market conditions and probably make some decisions on that back half of this year. David Arcaro : Got it. Thanks. And maybe separately, just in West Virginia with the dialogue that\u2019s going to be undertaken around the coal plants. Wondering if you could give any expectations on how you think that could play out if there is appetite to pull forward closures of Fort Martin or Harrison? Steve Strah : David, this is Steve. I think right now, it\u2019s too early on to really give you a good sense of that. We did do the ELG filing, which I think was an important step relative to just living up to our environmental responsibilities to continue to run those plants responsibly, as I have said in my prepared remarks. As for the ongoing dialogue that we are going to promote for the energy transition in West Virginia, we are really just going to take that one step at a time. And we are going to follow our approach in all matters here, and that\u2019s to be open and constructive, listen to various concerns along the way. I think concerns will lead to opportunities that we could define that we will be thoughtful of and really just take one step at a time. David Arcaro : Understood. Thanks so much for the color. Steve Strah : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So, just a couple of things. So, we are still waiting for an SEC settlement. I think we are all surprised that you guys are getting money from the last settlement. So, is there a way for you to communicate if net of that cash coming in, there is \u2013 you would still expect to have some meaningful cash outflow related to the SEC settlement? Steve Strah : Angie, thanks for your question. Our work with the SEC is continuing in terms of, once again, being open and collaborative with them. And I want to respect that process and really not get ahead of it at all. With regard to the very nature of a derivative suit, there was a cash payout from the insurance companies that amounted to the $180 million unless court approved plaintiff fees that will be cash returned to the corporation. We have several other items that are in litigation beyond the SEC work. And we are going to once again tackle those one at a time and just take it on a step-by-step basis. Angie Storozynski : Understood. And then secondly, can you comment on Icahn\u2019s involvement with the Board now that it feels like the strategic transformation of the company is almost done? Steve Strah : Well, I think their involvement with our Board remains unchanged. They have continued to be very constructive, very productive members of our Board, and I don\u2019t see any change in that, Angie, right now. And we have found them to be great colleagues of ours as we have moved ahead. Angie Storozynski : Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Steve Strah : Thanks Angie. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. It\u2019s actually Ryan on for Jeremy. Just wanted to ask one on the FERC audit that came out last week and you guys are kind of very clear on the different management changes that are going to being contemplated next year. But just wondering, is there anything in there that we would kind of be thinking about that would kind of impact go-forward earnings thinking about kind of the calculations or the capitalizations, any impacts from that? Steve Strah : Well, Ryan, let me just provide a couple of comments here, and then I will flip it over to Jon. As you recall, in 2019, FERC initiated a routine audit of accounting and reporting under FERC regulations. Due to the events in 2020, we saw that staff extended the audit. I think importantly, there is nothing that was newly identified that the company wasn\u2019t already aware of within the audit itself. And we did that through our own very thorough review of all the matters contained therein. Also, the audit didn\u2019t identify any additional lobbying related to expenses for those that had a question around that. As for the details of the key findings, I think I will pass that over to Jon Taylor, and he can elaborate. Jon Taylor : Yes, Ryan, there is really just two major findings that really impact our financial plan that we have already really incorporated into the business plan going forward. One was the capitalization of corporate support, and so we have factored that into our plan. We still got to get to a time study that\u2019s in process right now, but we have included an estimate of what we think will be the outcome associated with it, and then the capitalization of veg management. That also has been incorporated into our business plan. So, those are the two primary findings from a financial perspective. An you can see that we provided pro forma return on equities for each of our jurisdictions, which have been significantly lower from where they were on an actual basis in 2021. So, I kind of view this as a temporary issue in terms of being able to recover those costs in the future in rate cases that will be filed soon. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate all the color there. And then just maybe one on the settlement that was kind of announced last night, and I know I appreciate you on trying to get ahead anything. But just thinking through how we should be thinking about this kind of from a process standpoint and just when we might kind of get kind of incremental updates or announcements on all these different items, the moving pieces that are kind of involved in that settlement? Steve Strah : Well, Ryan, the way I look at the settlement, it\u2019s one more additional step for our company to put our legacy issues behind us. And by each action we take in this regard, we continue to rebuild the trust and be able to really focus our entire company on what is a very bright future with an excellent business strategy and supporting business plan. So, I don\u2019t have details beyond what\u2019s contained within the term sheet that\u2019s been made public. But as events warrant and significant issues are brought forward and moved, we will certainly keep the investment community up to speed on that. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you for taking my questions. Steve Strah : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Strah for any final comments. Steve Strah : Well, thank you. I wanted to thank you for your ongoing interest in FirstEnergy, and thank you very much for joining us today. And please, above all else, please stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today\u2019s discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year can be found in the Strategic and Financial Highlights document on the Investors section of our website. We will begin today\u2019s call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Strah : Thanks, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are off to a solid start in 2022. Yesterday, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.51 per share and operating earnings of $0.60 per share in line with the midpoint of our guidance. With our financial performance, operational momentum, portfolio of assets and robust long-term business model, we are in a strong position, and I am optimistic and excited about the future. Today we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.30 per share to $2.50 per share for 2022 and growth of 6% to 8% thereafter based on our five-year $17 billion investment plan. And while the dividend is subject to board approval, I can affirm that we will still expect to maintain our annual dividend rate of $1.56 per share this year with the objective to grow the dividend within our payout ratio as earnings increase from our 2022 base. This year we are focused on continuing our transformation into a company with a strong foundation and unrelenting focus on our customers, and a leader in the energy transition. Over the last couple of years, we have asked a lot of our employees as we implemented a series of changes. From FE Forward initiatives to our enhanced values, numerous updates to policies and procedures and multiple training sessions across the company our employees have accomplished a lot and they have done this while executing at a high level across the company. I am very grateful for all of them and incredibly appreciative of their work and strong performance over the many years, but especially over the last 18 months. I am very proud of what they have done. Building off this momentum, we believe that our employees and culture will be the single most important value drivers of our long-term strategy. Earlier this year, we formed a cross-functional Culture Transformation working group to consolidate, coordinate and streamline our numerous initiatives designed to drive culture change with the goal of making these changes meaningful and impactful to employees. By better aligning our culture initiatives and narrowing the focus with a simpler, integrated culture change roadmap for 2022, we can help employees make meaningful steps in a few areas at a time. The outcome of this work resulted in identifying three key focus areas for our culture transformation for 2022. Embedding our refreshed values, integrity, safety, DE&I, performance excellence and stewardship into every aspect of our culture. Fostering an open trusting environment, where leaders create opportunities for two way dialogue and employees feel valued and empowered, and improving advancement and development opportunities for our employees. We are supporting these efforts by consistently demonstrating our values in action in communicating with employees, creating a culture champion network to support our transformation efforts, facilitating listening sessions hosted by me and other members of our senior leadership team, along with small group employee discussions and quarterly speak up sessions that encourage open and transparent two-way dialogue and enhancing our focus and accountability around more robust, meaningful discussions between employees and their supervisors that support career management and development. We are striving to empower employees to make their jobs more meaningful and encourage the candor and collaboration that can make our company more innovative, customer focused and a great place to work. Changing a culture takes time, trust and persistent modeling, as well as alignment with our employee\u2019s personal values and needs. I am deeply committed to this, as is our leadership team and we view it as critically important work. By listening being more open and transparent we can do better and produce better results for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and investors. Taking a more open and engaged approach is also a cornerstone of our efforts to prioritize our customers and enhance the customer experience. Last month before Winter Utility Disconnection Moratoriums lifted in our areas, we launched an enhanced campaign to engage residential customers who may be facing financial hardships. We recognize that many customers in this position don\u2019t reach out for help and they may be unaware of the various utility bill assistance programs available to them. To reach these customers, we produced a video message featuring several members of our customer service team. They spoke passionately about their desire to assist customers and we raised awareness of various programs and payment options that might help during these difficult times. Our goal was to reach out and invite customers to come to us for help. At the end of March, we had more than a quarter million customers enrolled in Utility Assistance Programs, with $71 million in funding applied to those accounts, compared to the first quarter of 2021 that\u2019s an increase of more than 17% in contributions directly benefiting customers enrolled in these assistance programs this year. This effort also contributed to a continued decline of past due balances, which are now on par with pre-pandemic levels in Ohio and West Virginia, reducing the risk of bad debt. This campaign is the first step to enhance the customer experience, show customers that we care and we will help them wherever they are on their journey. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, FE Forward is our engine for optimizing our organization and customer focused initiatives, including numerous projects designed to enhance communications, self-service options and provide better experiences for customers who are in need of assistance. For example, we have recently enhanced our website to make it easier for customers to understand and pay their bills. They can also use new features to easily make a payment for a family member or friend, enroll in payment plans that level out their billing, identify assistance programs and avoid service disconnection. From an organization standpoint, now that we have aligned our utility operations into a five state model to enhance collaboration, streamline processes and maximize efficiency, we are beginning a longer term review to consider the possible benefits of combining our Ohio entities, as well as those in Pennsylvania from a legal, financial, operational and branding perspective. And finally, FE Forward will improve productivity and our cost structure through investments in digital technologies, upgrading and integrating key systems and using data to help us make better, more efficient decisions for our customers. Through these investments, we anticipate significant productivity improvements, substantially reducing the need for high cost external contractors that augment our workforce today. Our commitment to prioritizing customers also means providing excellent service and preparing for the grid of the future. In Ohio, we are nearing the end of the first phase of our Grid Mod program, which began in 2019 and includes investments in smart meters, distribution, automation and voltage regulating equipment. The program also supports our advanced distribution management system that is being installed to help automate the outage restoration process and optimize grid performance. We are excited about the benefits these investments can provide to our customers, including enhanced reliability, improved power quality and greater visibility into their electricity usage. We plan to file for a second phase of Grid Mod investments in Ohio in the third quarter to continue this successful program. In New Jersey, JCP&L received approval from the BPU to begin installing smart meters on customer homes and businesses in 2023. The approved plan includes a capital investment of $421 million for the installation of more than $1.1 million smart meters over a 36-month period. Across our entire footprint, our utilities have installed more than $2.7 million smart meters since 2014, with implementation efforts nearly complete in Pennsylvania and currently underway in Ohio. In New Jersey, we are working toward a settlement of our proposed EV driven program. The four-year program is designed to accelerate the adoption of light-duty electric vehicles with incentives in rate structures that would support the development of an EV charging infrastructure throughout our JCP&L service territory. We are also making solid progress to complete our sale of a 19.9% stake in FET to Brookfield. Last week, Sophie has notified FET and Brookfield that it\u2019s determined there were known unresolved national security issues and its review of the transaction was concluded. And yesterday FERC issued its orders on the pending applications for Blackstone\u2019s designee to serve as a voting member on the FP Corp. Board and for authority to close the transaction with Brookfield. We remain on track to close the sale of the FET minority interest in the second quarter of this year and deploy the proceeds thereafter. We also continue to make progress in resolving outstanding litigation in order to provide certainty to stakeholders and focus our attention on the future. Last week, we reached a settlement in the ratepayer civil RICO lawsuit in the amount of $37.5 million. We previously recognized a reserve for this settlement in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings. I am looking forward to working with our refreshed Board, including new nominees Sean Klimczak of Blackstone and Jana Croom, who is the Chief Financial Officer for Kimball Electronics. At the same time, I\u2019d like to express my sincere appreciation to our outgoing Board members, Don Misheff; Mike Anderson; Julia Johnson; Tom Mitchell; Chris Pappas; and Luis Reyes. I am very grateful for their expertise and guidance. Thank you for your time today. We are committed to continue delivering financial and operational excellence as we execute our long-term business strategies and transform our company into a more innovative, resilient and industry-leading organization. Now I will turn the call over to Jon for a financial update. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As Steve said, we are off to a solid start this year. Our first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.51 per share and operating earnings of $0.60 per share were in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the impact of our recently issued equity, rate credits provided to Ohio customers under our PUCO approved stipulation last year and an accounting policy changes, operating earnings increased by $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. Our first quarter results include several special items, the largest being a $0.06 per share charge associated with the redemption and early retirement of an $850 million FE Corp. note in January of this year. Excluding the items I mentioned the results in our distribution business decreased slightly, but were consistent with our business plan. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a slight increase in operating and other expenses, primarily related to planned plant outages in West Virginia and higher storm costs and employee benefits, partially offset by lower uncollectible expense. These costs were partially offset by higher customer demand and the continued economic recovery in the commercial and industrial segments. It\u2019s important to note that our operating costs were in line with our forecast as discussed on the fourth quarter call. Our total distribution deliveries increased 3.6% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and we are only slightly off our load forecast for the first quarter. Breaking the year-over-year impact down by customer class, we saw a 2.2% increase in residential demand, due primarily to weather and on a weather adjusted basis customer usage decreased only slightly versus the first quarter of 2021, as customers continued resuming normal work and social activities. Deliveries to commercial customers increased 7.6% and 4.7% on a weather adjusted basis, which is a significant increase in this customer class, while sales to industrial customers increased 2.5% with many sectors including steel and automotive showing recovery from recessionary conditions. Overall, customer demand continues to slowly return to pre-pandemic levels. Our one-year residential sales trend is about 3% higher than 2019 levels, while commercial and industrial deliveries remain about 4% and 2% below 2019. In our transmission business first quarter results increased $0.03 per share, primarily due to rate base growth associated with our ongoing investments in our Energizing the Future program and in our corporate segment, our results compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily reflect lower interest expense and higher investment returns. In addition to our earnings guidance, we are on track to meet our cash from operations target of $2.6 billion to $3 billion this year and improve operating cash flow consistent with earnings over time. We met with the rating agencies earlier this month and had a good conversation about our progress, including our ongoing efforts to improve our balance sheet and strengthen the credit profile of FirstEnergy, as we work to reach 13% FFO to debt by 2024, targeting mid-teens thereafter. As Steve mentioned, we are on track to close the FET transaction in the second quarter. As we said, we plan to use a significant portion of the $2.4 billion in proceeds from the Brookfield transaction, together with the $1 billion Blackstone equity investment to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt or debt-like obligations and to fund our capital program. In addition to the $850 million FE Corp. note, we retired in January, we plan to retire an additional $500 million at the corporate level after the Brookfield transaction closes and recapitalize certain operating companies to enhance their credit metrics and capital structures. Later this year, we will make a determination on the deployment of the remaining $800 million, which could be used for a voluntary pension contribution, further reductions in FE Corp. debt or to fund CapEx. As we have mentioned previously, 2022 is a light year on the debt financing front, with up to $750 million of planned debt issuances. However, steep increases in interest rates and market volatility have impacted our pension plan. As of the end of the first quarter, the discount rate for our pension application increased nearly 75 basis points or 25% to 3.75%, while the assets in the pension plan had close to a 6% loss for the quarter. While the funded status has improved from 82% at the end of 2021 to 84%, the volatility in the interest rate and equity markets has created a potential headwind for higher pension expense in 2023 and beyond. This is something we will continue to watch throughout the remainder of the year, but we are already thinking through different opportunities to offset this potential headwind. Yesterday, we affirmed our 2022 operating earnings guidance and provided guidance for the second quarter of $0.46 per share to $0.56 per share. Given the number of moving pieces we have this year, we recognize consensus estimates by quarter are somewhat challenging for analysts at the moment and we appreciate your work to get through this period with us. We are off to a solid start this year and we have got an excellent transformation plan to continue becoming an industry-leading company focused on long-term value for investors, customers, our communities and employees. As always, I appreciate your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I will open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Steve Strah : Good morning, Jeremy. How are you? Jeremy Tonet : Good. Good. Thanks. Just want to start off, I guess, with the review that you spoke about with potentially combining the Pennsylvania and Ohio entities in the respective states. And just wondering if you could walk us through in a bit more detail what would be kind of the gives and takes of why or why not do that as you think about this process going forward and why is the review happening now as opposed to any point in the past as well, just kind of curious on your thought process and what the drivers could be there? Steve Strah : Well, thanks for your question. Through our FE Forward program, we have aligned our operations into a five state operating model and we are finding efficiency gains there already even though it\u2019s early in the process and, and we are very excited by that. We are reviewing the legal entity and financial consolidation, because we believe the time is right to stand a team up and do a very thorough review of the opportunity. We have fielded calls and had questions over the last several years in my experience and would there be an opportunity here. And given our comprehensive review of the organization opportunities, we thought now is the right time to get a project team stood up and underway. And while it\u2019s early, the teams are really going to be charged with assessing the benefits for the company through any kind of consolidation, but then we also have to keep our customers in mind and what type of benefits they may see from any action that we take here. The potential benefits, Jeremy, to me are the potential for increased efficiencies in some of our administrative functions and there is also a possibility that it could provide us better access to capital markets. So that\u2019s really our view of it. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. So, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s anything out there that would prevent you or dissuade you at this point as long as everything unfolds as what you expect in the review process. Is that kind of a fair way to think about it? Steve Strah : Well, I think, the team is charged with probably a critical cost benefit analysis and once we are completed with that, we are going to do what makes sense here for our customers and for our company. And if it makes sense to us, we will move ahead and we will keep you updated on our progress. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thanks for that. Just pivoting here, I want to touch -- to hit on some of these accounting changes that you are going through your distribution companies. And could you just refresh us, walk us through the process that led you to these changes and how we should be thinking about impacts going forward here? Is everything kind of set at this point as far as of what levels of changes there are? Jon Taylor : Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. This is John. First of all, let me apologize in advance for my voice. I have been under the weather this week and my voice is a little off. But to answer your question, there\u2019s really two primary accounting changes. One was corporate support costs that we had historically capitalized based on a methodology. As we went through the FERC audit, they had maybe a different point of view. And so we came to a conclusion that some of the corporate costs that we had historically capitalized going forward wouldn\u2019t get that level of capitalization going forward. And then the second accounting change was around veg management, where we had historically capitalized a portion of our veg management program, and through various state audits and the FERC audit we decided to move forward with having all that flow through the P&L. So on average it\u2019s about $150 million a year that historically had been capitalized that now flow through the P&L that is baked into our plan for the full year of 2022 and going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Sounds good. I will leave it there. Thank you. Steve Strah : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning to you and thank you for the time. So maybe just the high level, how did the April rating agency conversations go, how are you think about the prospects for fully being IG? Steve Strah : Julien, thanks for the question. As Jon had mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had three what I would characterize as very good meetings in April to discuss our continued transformation and our ongoing efforts to improve our balance sheet. I think in all three cases, there was an acknowledgement of the progress that we are making as a company and executing on what our plan was for the last year to 18 months and it\u2019s also clear to me that we have to continue that track record of executing our business plan. So, our focus, as we have said many times is to get to the FFO-to-debt goal of 13% no later than 2024. And I think that\u2019s well-received, as well as thereafter getting into the mid-teens level. We also had a dialogue on the use of proceeds for the two transformative transactions that we executed on in the fourth quarter. And I think we are taking those steps needed to get to investment grade, and as we have stated before, that it\u2019s very important for us and it is a very key focus for us moving ahead. Jon Taylor, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add to that perhaps. Jon Taylor : Yeah. Steve, I think, you said it well. I thought the meetings were very productive, a lot of discussion around culture and the things that we are doing around our code of conduct and other policies, as well as our financial plan. As you know, Julien, two of them have us on positive outlook. And I think as long as we continue to execute, I am optimistic that they are going to be in a position to upgrade sometime this year. It might be later this year, but as long as we continue to execute against our plan, I am optimistic that they will be able to do something later this year. Now, for S&P, they have us on a stable outlook. They have a little bit of a different timeline. But from the conversations that we had, I do anticipate that they could be in a position to at least have an outlook change maybe as early as the fourth quarter. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Great. And just a couple more detailed ones here, if I can. I mean, on the pension, what does it currently look like given the moves that we have seen in rates just even since 3/31, can you quantify the potential earnings impact? And then also on the accounting change, was there any amount that would replace the amount you capitalized? What was that amount and then what jurisdiction? Jon Taylor : Yeah. So Julien on the pension, let me just maybe some level set the group here on. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, but there\u2019s some volatility in the interest rate environment, as well as the equity markets. And on the balance sheet side of things, it\u2019s been positive, right? It\u2019s moved our funded status from 82% at the end of last year to 84%, which is about a $350 million improvement in the liability, which improves credit metrics by about 20 basis points. However, for pension expense, because of the planned losses versus the expected return, that\u2019s going to put some pressure on or at least some potential pressure on pension expense. And if you had the market at the end of March, it would have been about a $0.10 per share headwind for us. Now a couple of thoughts I would offer. First of all, we have eight months to go in terms of setting pension expense for next year. So it\u2019s early and we have we have time to recover. But more importantly, the management team is already planning, is it this headwinds going to exist and we will be able to use the O&M benefits associated with our FE Forward program that we recently announced as offsets, as well as we are looking at other opportunities around the timing of maintenance activities, we are looking at our debt financing plan including voluntary pension contributions and many more opportunities. So bottomline is, we wanted to be transparent, and more importantly, articulate our plan that we are working on. Obviously, this is something that we are going to continue to monitor. But we run our business conservatively and always have levers that we can pull to offset items such as this. Steve Strah : Julien, this is Steve. I would just also add, we have seen volatility surrounding pension performance in our past. We have demonstrated in our past that we can overcome headwinds. And also, I would add that, it is our ongoing effort to be transparent about key issues like this and it\u2019s early in the year. As John said, we have eight months and the team is dedicated to defeat any headwinds that we will see. So I am very confident in that, and once again, we will keep you updated throughout the year as we proceed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. And then\u2026 Steve Strah : Yeah. And Julien, I am sorry, you had a two part question. Maybe you could just\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. I was going to -- sorry, on the accounting changes, just what was in rate base, if you will? How is that moving around size, super quick clarification? Jon Taylor : Yeah. So all the accounting changes, Julien, were prospective, so\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Jon Taylor : It\u2019s back to historical rate base. So it was a prospective change. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the patience. Steve Strah : Thank you very much, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Great. Thanks. I think you answered my question on the pension. It sounds like that\u2019s just manageable within the 6% to 8% growth rate. Is that fair? Steve Strah : Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And maybe any thoughts on, you obviously were very successful with the transmission sell down. Any thoughts on whether it might make sense for additional asset sales? I guess you don\u2019t really have any further equity needs except the -- that the $100 million a year thing. So I am just curious any thoughts there? Jon Taylor : Yeah. Hi, Steve. This is John. So you are right, we don\u2019t have any additional equity leads in our plan. Obviously, we feel like we have the right level of growth in cash flow to get back to an investment grade and fund our capital programs and connect competitive dividends. Having said that, I think, if you look at the track record of this management team, we are going to do what\u2019s right for shareholders. And if there was ever an opportunity or need like that again in the future, we would absolutely look at all of our options and capitalize on the difference between public and private market valuations, just like we did last year. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. And just any, I guess, further update on the shareholder settlement process, I think, after got a little noisy with that one judge, just how confident are you that that\u2019s going to get approved? Steve Strah : Well. Steve, you are referring to the derivative lawsuit settlement and just the\u2026 Steve Fleishman : That\u2019s correct. Steve Strah : \u2026 for everyone. I got it. All parties in the shareholder derivative cases agreed to a global settlement, and as you know, it\u2019s subject to court approval. On March 11 the parties submitted their papers to the Southern District of Ohio court and the approval process will take a little bit of time. And I just want to continue to respect that ongoing process and that\u2019s where we stand on it. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you. Steve Strah : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Just following on the investigation, can you give us an update on what\u2019s going on with the SEC investigation? Steve Strah : Sure, Angie. Thanks for your question. The investigations are ongoing and we as a company continue to fully cooperate and we are ready to do that. I can\u2019t really speculate on any timing for completion right now. We are somewhat on their timetable and we respect that. So I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of the process and that\u2019s really where we stand with it right now. Angie Storozynski : And you haven\u2019t provisioned, so there\u2019s no reserve or any provision for that potential settlement or fine, whatever you call it? Steve Strah : No. It -- I -- we have noted in our 10-Q that we believe that it\u2019s probable that we will incur a loss, but we can\u2019t reasonably estimate it at this time. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then, secondly, Jon, you mentioned that, the O&M is tracking your annual plan. It\u2019s a little bit surprising to me to see maintenance outage expense for power plants during the first quarter, which is the peak usage season for power. Is it just the -- it\u2019s basically that\u2019s when the outage happens and hence the recognition of the cost? Jon Taylor : Yeah. The outage was in late February, March. So, March being kind of a shorter month, I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s unusual at all. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then, lastly, I think that you guys mentioned that, there\u2019s another Grid Mod, this CapEx filing in Ohio, is that something new, because I actually didn\u2019t expect any regulatory proceedings besides just the pending audits in Ohio this year? Jon Taylor : No. That\u2019s -- Angie, that\u2019s something that we have had on our radar for quite some time. We started the Grid Mod 1 program three years ago and that was always the intention that there would be different phases of the Grid Mod program. And so that\u2019s something that will file probably later this year or we will find out later this year. We have already kind of had some discussions with some of the intervening parties around the plan and some of the thoughts. But it will be kind of a continuation of our Grid Mod 1 program, smart meters, distribution automation, voltage regulation. We might do some pilot work around trip savers and utility on storage, battery on storage, those types of programs. But this is always been in the plan. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then the last one, where do you expect to be on the FFO-to-debt by the end of this year? Jon Taylor : So, from an S&P perspective we will be over 11% and from a Moody\u2019s perspective we will be somewhere between 10.5% and 11%. So that\u2019s kind of where we are targeting. A lot of it\u2019s going to depend on what we do with the final $800 million of the proceeds, whether we fund the pension or take out additional holding company debt. So those numbers could change quite a bit, but that\u2019s current -- that\u2019s our thinking. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Steve Strah : Thanks, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lapides : Hey, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Just curious can you remind us ex the accounting changes, what was embedded in 2022 guidance for O&M growth or O&M savings rate year-over-year? Jon Taylor : Yeah. So, Michael, if you do -- if you adjust last year with O&M for the accounting changes, just our base level operating costs, we are going to be about $1.4 billion this year. Last year we were a little bit north of that number. So as you start to think through the rest of this year, especially in the second half of this year, you will start to see some O&M reductions relative to the prior year based on our FE Forward program and then that will continue into the following year. So, we are super excited about it and its meaningful reductions and you will start to see that in the second half of this year. And that\u2019s going to give us some flexibility to do some things strategically where if we want to put some additional O&M and certain jurisdictions or do some other things, it just gives us a lot of flexibility, when you have that type of program. Michael Lapides : Got it. And when I\u2026 Steve Strah : And that\u2026 Michael Lapides : Oh! Go ahead. Steve Strah : Sorry, Michael. This is Steve. I was just going to add, even while you are going to see that impact on O&M, which will be a lowering impact, we are keeping our customers at the center of the equation here also. And that is even as we lower O&M by the reinvestment in certain ways in our various computer systems, the ability to streamline service for customers, the customer experience will be enhanced all at the same time. So I just wanted to add that sort of step down there. Michael Lapides : Oh! Good. Just one follow-up there, when I think about the long-term, did the long-term kind of whatever O&M assumption is embedded in guidance? Does that include the benefit you may realize from the utility consolidations in Ohio and Pennsylvania? Jon Taylor : Well, so Michael, so the benefit associated with the consolidation of Pennsylvania and Ohio, that\u2019s not necessarily an O&M benefit. There might be some administrative things that are streamlined. But in the main, it\u2019s not an O&M benefit. Because as Steve mentioned, we have already gone to a five state operating model operation, right? And so we already operating with this and that\u2019s where some of the benefits on the O&M side is the streamlining of the operations into that five state operating model. The benefits associated with consolidating some of the legal entities is on the financing side, right? I mean, right now, those companies, smaller companies and they are accessing the private debt markets and the little bit more expensive than if you were to access the public markets. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. And then, finally, just coming to one of the regulatory items, the light-vehicle charging program in New Jersey that you are kind of trying to reach settlement for, can you remind us what\u2019s the capital required in that? Jon Taylor : So, I think, we are going to be -- it\u2019s going to be south of $100 million. I think it\u2019s going to be probably somewhere around $50 million that will be rate based. But, yeah, we are working the settlement, and hopefully, we will have some clarity around that, too. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jon. Thanks, Steve. Much appreciate it, guys. Steve Strah : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sanjay Banerjee [ph] with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of one. So you mentioned OpCo recapitalization. Could you remind us which OpCos would specifically target and just how much of the proceeds from the disposal you would allocate there? And then, secondly, around these $800 million that could be used for pension contribution or HoldCo debt, are leaning towards one or the other right now, would Moody\u2019s prefer you get it more towards HoldCo debt reduction and could that accelerate the upgrade to investment rating? Thanks. Jon Taylor : Yeah. So when it comes to the equity contributions and then the operating companies, that\u2019s primarily going to be in our Pennsylvania companies in Mon Power, in West Virginia, maybe a little bit in Ohio, but primarily Pennsylvania and West Virginia. And then, like I said, just a little bit in Ohio. So that\u2019s kind of what we are targeting right now. A lot of those cap structures over the years have moved down to the mid-40s. We are going to get those back up to 50%. So we feel good about that plan. When it comes to the $800 million, obviously, a lot of it depends on the interest rate environment, where the funding status of the pension plan ends, incremental capital opportunities. Our focus is on improving the balance sheet, enhancing our credit metrics, but also to make sure anything we do is accretive to earnings. The conversations that we had with Moody\u2019s specifically, I didn\u2019t get the sense that they, pension contribution versus HoldCo debt take out, I don\u2019t think they, they counted adjusted debt to them anyway both. And so I didn\u2019t think they had a view one way or the other. But we are obviously as we kind of make these decisions, we will run things by them. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. And just one very quick follow-up. When you have the conversation with the agencies, did you get a sense that they were looking for anything else outside of the sale of the FET minority stake, so conclusion of any of the investigations with the SEC, just curious there? Jon Taylor : No. I didn\u2019t get that sense. I mean, like, I said, I think, for us it\u2019s just a matter of executing our plan and deploying the proceeds from the Brookfield transaction. And I think they are very pleased with the changes that we have made. They are very interested in our cultural changes and the things that we are doing around our compliance program and stuff like that. So, I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t get the sense that there was anything else that they were looking for. But I don\u2019t want to speak for them. I just don\u2019t recall that in the conversation being a big issue. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you very much. Steve Strah : Thank you Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Fremont : Thanks. Does the debt pay down at the HoldCo and the potential recapitalization of utilities in any way change your equity guidance for the next five years? And if not, should we just expect that capital spending will ultimately be funded all with debt? Jon Taylor : So, well, let me address your question there. I mean, if you think about our $17 billion capital program and the equity proceeds that we have coming in, plus the cash from operations that will generate over the five-year period. We are only going to fund our capital program with 30% debt, $5 billion. In the meantime, we are going to take out $1.5 billion. So over the forecast period our balance sheet debt is only going to grow by $3.5 billion, even though we are going to invest $17 billion. Paul Fremont : And does that include expected funding, additional funding of holding company? Jon Taylor : We won\u2019t, I mean, so the plan right now is the holding company debt, after we take out the $500 million this year, we will be a $6.5 billion. So it will not -- we will not have any more holding company debt. In fact, if we make a decision that we are going to take out more holding company debt that will be less than that. Paul Fremont : Okay. And then, I guess, you are talking about possible pension funding. Have you determined on a target number for pension funding this year? Jon Taylor : It would be voluntary. It\u2019s a voluntary contribution. So\u2026 Paul Fremont : I guess in the past\u2026 Jon Taylor : \u2026we don\u2019t required. Paul Fremont : It\u2019s been like around $500 million. Is that sort of a reasonable assumption that that would continue? Jon Taylor : So the remaining proceeds, Paul, is $800 million from the two transactions and if we decide to make a pension contribution, that\u2019s totally up to us. So it could be the full $800 million. It could be, we decide to go a different route and maybe take out additional holding company debt, maybe we fund a pension $300 million or $400 million. There\u2019s a lot to be worked out and so I can\u2019t give you a good answer, but it\u2019s a voluntary contribution, not a mandatory or required contribution. Paul Fremont : Great. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s -- thank you very much. Steve Strah : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill : Yeah. Thank you. I was wondering how you are thinking about the 50-basis-point RTO adder and I know you have disclosed sort of your sensitivities to that. But in sort of downside scenario, how does that affect your thoughts around earnings guidance? Steve Strah : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a material impact on earnings guidance, Gregg. I think we have been fairly clear that the -- and the sensitivity that we do have for it, it will not materially throw us off track in terms of achieving our goals. We also continue to believe that the adder is appropriate and it\u2019s helpful for us, as we continue to build out and improve transmission reliability for our system in our five state footprint and that\u2019s where we stand on it. Gregg Orrill : Got it. Thank you. Steve Strah : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor over to Mr. Strah for closing remarks. Steve Strah : Well, thank you very much and thanks for your ongoing support and attention today. I did want to just take a brief moment and wish everyone a Happy Earth Day, which is today actually. At FirstEnergy, we are really proud of our commitment to the environment. This week we stated a goal in which we are going to plant 20,000 trees throughout our service territory. It\u2019s just one of a number of different initiatives organized by our Green teams, which are employee volunteers who support environmental initiatives in a full range of items, from planting trees to beach cleanups to recycling. And I am just very, very proud of our employees that are engaged in such an important activity for us and I just wanted to acknowledge and thank them for that today. And with that, I will call it close to the call. Thank you for your continued attention and support, and we will be talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.  We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year can be found in the Strategic and Financial Highlights document on the Investors section of our website.  We'll begin today's call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Strah : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today. Yesterday, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.33 per share and operating earnings of $0.53 per share at the upper end of our guidance range. Today, we are reaffirming our 2022 operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. We are also affirming our long-term annual operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 8% and accelerating our FFO-to-debt target of 13% by 1 year to 2023 from 2024 with targeted metrics in the mid-teens thereafter.  As Jon will discuss later, given our strong year-to-date performance, we have begun strategically investing in maintenance activities in our distribution businesses to further improve reliability and get ahead of future planned work. This provides tremendous flexibility in our long-term plan. We will continue to accelerate these operating expenses during the second half based on the strong outlook for the remainder of the year. Through the first half of 2022, we've made significant progress to strengthen our culture, optimize our operations, bolster our financial position and support the grid of the future, continuing our momentum to become a more customer-focused and sustainable utility. Across the company, we're continuing to amplify our core values of safety, integrity, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence and stewardship. We've recently launched a new employee communication campaign to focus on each of these values and how they drive our success.  In addition, I personally connected with thousands of employees over the past several months to discuss our core values and to hear directly from them on what we can do to get better as a company. Since March, I've held about 50 virtual and in-person listening sessions with more than 4,000 employees across FirstEnergy. We've had a lot of great engagement during these sessions and it's been incredibly valuable for me to interact with employees and get their feedback. I'm very proud of how our employees are executing on our plan and of the company and the culture we're creating together.  I'd also like to take a moment to welcome 2 new directors who were elected to the Board at our Annual Meeting in May. Sean Klimczak of Blackstone and Jana Croom of Kimball Electronics. In related developments, John Somerhalder was elected Board Chair and no longer serves as an executive of the company. And Lisa Winston Hicks was elected Lead Independent Director. I welcome the guidance, leadership and support from our refreshed Board.  Now let's turn to some key accomplishments in the quarter. First, in May, we completed the sale of the 19.9% minority stake in FirstEnergy Transmission, LLC to Brookfield for approximately $2.4 billion. The proceeds from this historic transaction, together with the $1 billion Blackstone equity investment that closed in December have been deployed to strengthen our balance sheet and fund our regulated capital investments. And as Jon will discuss in more detail later, by paying down over $2.5 billion in long-term debt this year, we are driving meaningful progress and are ahead of our original plan to improve the credit profile of the company. Our transmission business continues to be one of the focal points of our strategy. Our Energizing the Future program has a relentless focus on reliability improvements for our customers.  We began the investment program in the ATSI region in 2014. And since that time, we have seen a 53% reduction in the interruptions to customers caused by transmission outages, a 49% decrease in transmission line outages and an 88% improvement of our protection systems. We're striving to build on this success within ATSI and across our territory as we continue to expand this investment program.  So far this year, we've completed important work across our footprint to reconfigure several substations, rebuild transmission lines, replace transformers and enhance network, cyber and physical security. These projects improve operational flexibility, upgrade the condition of equipment and enhance system performance. Our goals for the transmission business are aggressive yet achievable and we have the right strategies in place to ensure our success.  We're also making continued progress to advance our customer-focused, sustainable growth strategies on the distribution side of our business. In Ohio, earlier this month, we filed for the second phase of our grid modernization program, which builds off the system upgrades we've completed in the state since the PUCO approved our Grid Mod I program in 2019. The new 4-year Grid Mod II plan proposes a $626 million capital investment to expand our deployment of Grid Mod technologies designed to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power, promote modern experiences for customers, offering emerging technologies and provide opportunities to help lower customer bills.  The second phase of our Grid Mod program includes installing automated equipment on nearly 240 distribution circuits that can isolate problems, minimize the number of customers impacted by an outage and quickly restore electric service. Energy-saving voltage-regulating equipment on nearly 220 circuits that can reduce the amount of energy that must be generated and more evenly distribute electricity down a power line. And an additional 700,000 smart meters along with the supporting communications infrastructure and data management systems. In addition, the filing includes several pilot programs expected to provide enhanced customer benefits. These include supporting the adoption of EVs across our Ohio service territory by offering incentives to residential and commercial customers who participate in utility-managed charging of their electric vehicles and installing a battery storage system along the Ohio Turnpike that's designed to support increased EV charging load and enhanced grid reliability.  In the aggregate, we estimate the benefits to our Ohio customers of enhanced reliability, energy efficiency opportunities and the innovative products and services to exceed the cost of the Grid Mod II program by nearly $280 million in today's dollars.  Moving to West Virginia. In April, the Public Service Commission provided conditional approval of our requested tariff to build a total of 50 MW of utility-scale solar generation in the state at a cost of approximately $100 million. In their order, the PSC required our Mon Power and Potomac Edison subsidiaries to subscribe at least 85% of the output before beginning construction on these facilities.  We began accepting commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers to purchase solar RECs in May. We're making progress to meet the 85% threshold. And at that time, Mon Power and Potomac Edison will seek final approval from the commission for a surcharge to cover the balance of the project costs and begin full-scale construction. We expect the first solar generation site to be in service by the end of 2023, with the construction completed at the 4 other sites no later than the end of 2025. Finally, in New Jersey, JCP&L reached a settlement on our electric vehicle program with BPU staff, New Jersey Rate Counsel and others which was approved by the BPU without modifications in June.  Our 4-year $40 million EV-driven program is designed to accelerate the adoption of light-duty electric vehicles with incentives and rate structures that continue to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our JCP&L service territory. The cost of the program will be deferred into a regulatory asset. Capital costs will earn a return of 9.6% with recovery of those costs determined in JCP&L's next base rate case.  Before I pass the call over to Jon, we recognize there is significant interest in our pension plan performance in light of rising interest rates and the current bear market. We're committed to being transparent and flexible on this issue, and we'll keep you informed on our expectations and our plan as the year progresses.  In addition to the details Jon will provide on today's call, we've also published 2 new slides on this topic in our highlights document. I'm very pleased with our progress throughout the first half of this year. We remain committed to continuing our transformation and becoming an industry-leading utility that provides value to our investors, customers, employees and communities. Now I'll turn the call over to Jon. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. I'll start with some additional perspective on the pension, then we'll move into a discussion of our earnings and other financial matters. To put this all in context, the impact of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other macroeconomic factors has resulted in extreme inflation and market volatility that we haven't seen in over 40 years. And so we recognize that this is a topic that has a lot of attention today, but we don't consider this an issue that impacts the long-term value proposition of the company. Through the first half of this year, interest rates have increased significantly with the discount rate that measures our pension obligation increasing from 3% at the end of 2021 to approximately 4.8% as of the end of June. Likewise, equity markets across the globe were down significantly with asset performance in our pension trust down approximately 15% through June. Although this results in an estimated earnings headwind of approximately $0.30 per share beginning in 2023, which reduces the noncash benefit from the pension from $0.40 per share in 2022 to an estimated $0.10 per share in 2023, the funded status of our qualified pension plan has improved from 82% at the end of 2021 to 84% at the end of June.  Although we believe the earnings impact associated with the pension will normalize over time, we recognize that the historic market environment presents a challenge in the near term from an earnings perspective. And so let me take a minute to address this. First, our regulated strategy and capital investment program continues to be strong as we transition more of our capital investments to formula rates with real-time returns while working to lower our base operating expenses.  Our base plan includes formula rate investments of approximately $2.4 billion in 2023 and $2.6 billion in 2024 that earned solid returns. In addition, as Steve mentioned, the outlook for 2022 is very strong given the successful tender offer completed in June at our holding company and higher-than-anticipated income from legacy, commodity-based investments. And our FE Forward program continues to be part of our plan, allowing us to optimize our cost structure and be more strategic with our operating costs.  In combination, these items allow us to accelerate future planned maintenance work into 2022 that will provide flexibility with operating expenses in future years while meeting our financial commitments for this year. We have also identified a number of other steps to address the pension headwind. These include accelerating additional capital investments and optimizing our financing plans, which includes moving $1 billion of planned debt financings from 2023 to future years, reducing corporate costs in our real estate footprint as well as anticipated benefits from continued improvements we are seeing in customer arrears.  From a regulatory perspective, we are exploring proposed changes to rate treatment for our pension to moderate impacts of market volatility between rate cases. But this will take some time and will likely be executed as we file base rate cases in each jurisdiction over the next few years.  And so I'll conclude the pension discussion to say this. We realize this is complicated and recognize the potential near-term earnings impact to the company. But we do believe there is a clear silver lining. As markets became volatile and interest rates increased, we were able to take advantage of the situation by retiring high key fund debt and amounts well above our original plan.  At the same time, rising interest rates reduced our pension liability by $550 million. And as a result, as Steve mentioned earlier, we made significant progress through the first half of this year, to improve our balance sheet and strengthen the credit profile of FirstEnergy. Utilizing the proceeds from the Brookfield and Blackstone transactions, we eliminated approximately $2.4 billion of holdco debt in the first 6 months of the year, which equates to $125 million in saved interest costs on an annual basis. This includes the early retirement of an $850 million FE Corp note in January, a $500 million FE Corp note in June and the repurchase of $1 billion in high coupon FE notes through our successful tender offer last month.  This surpasses our original plan for holding company debt reduction and brings FirstEnergy holdco debt as a percentage of total debt to 26% from 33% at the end of 2021. And based on our current forecast with these enhancements, we are tracking just under 12% FFO-to-debt in 2022 and plan to be at 13% FFO-to-debt in 2023, a year ahead of what we initially targeted.  Last week, Fitch upgraded FirstEnergy and FET to investment grade and upgraded our utilities to a BBB flat rating, reflecting the successful completion of our equity transactions, use of those proceeds to pay down company debt and the expected strengthening of our credit metrics, our settlement to address key Ohio regulatory issues and our meaningful improvements on governance matters. We are proud of the progress we made. And as we saw with the FET transaction, premium valuations of our businesses in the private sector give us significant optionality to further improve the balance sheet and increase value for shareholders.  And now let's turn to a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.33 per share and operating earnings were $0.53 per share and within the upper end of our earnings guidance range. The $0.20 of special items in the quarter include a charge of $0.17 per share associated with the redemption and early retirement of FE Corp notes that we discussed earlier. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions, operating earnings increased by $0.06 per share or 13% compared to the second quarter of 2021.  On a year-to-date basis, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share and operating earnings of $1.12 per share. Again, adjusting for the impacts of accounting policy changes, Ohio rate credits and dilution, this represents a $0.06 improvement versus our operating earnings for the first half of 2021 or approximately 6% year-over-year growth.  Results for the quarter in our distribution business decreased slightly compared to the second quarter of 2021, but remain consistent with our expectations. The positive impact of our investment programs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey was offset by slightly lower residential customer demand, as I'll discuss in a moment, and higher planned operating expenses including planned maintenance outages at our generation facilities as well as the impact of accelerated maintenance work we mentioned earlier. I do want to note, despite the inflationary conditions, our year-to-date base O&M expenses are consistent with our operating plan, reflecting strong financial discipline. Total and weather-adjusted distribution deliveries increased approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of 2021 as a result of stronger demand from commercial and industrial customers, reflecting improving conditions versus last year.  Residential sales decreased 1.6% on a year-over-year basis due primarily to milder weather compared to the second quarter of 2021. On a weather-adjusted basis, residential usage decreased slightly due to a continued shift to more normal work and social activities, albeit sales in this class continue to be elevated as compared to pre-pandemic levels.  Deliveries to commercial customers increased 1.5% or 1.9% on a weather-adjusted basis and sales to industrial customers increased 2.4% versus last year. And for the first time, industrial sales were higher than pre-pandemic levels by close to 1%, reflecting strong recovery and growth in many sectors, including steel, fabricated metals, automotive and food manufacturing.  In our transmission business, second quarter results benefited from strong rate base growth associated with our ongoing investments in the Energizing the Future program to improve reliability for our customers. We currently have more than 1,000 transmission projects underway across our footprint, and we've been successful working through acute supply chain challenges to remain on track with our plan to invest $1.5 billion in our system this year.  And finally, in our corporate segment, our results improved by $0.09 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021, largely impacted by higher profits from our legacy investment in a mining operation in Montana as well as lower interest costs from our efforts around the balance sheet I mentioned earlier.  The legacy investment is from the late 2000s where we are a minority investor with a 33% share in the facility. Historically, it has not been a significant driver of our results. However, given higher commodity prices, the mine is outperforming our expectations for 2022 with both earnings and cash distributions, which as I mentioned before, provides us significant flexibility to accelerate reliability and maintenance work in our distribution business.  Although earnings from this investment may continue in the future years, our original plan did not include any earnings contribution beyond 2022. We're off to a solid start for the first half of the year with a strong outlook for the second half. As Steve mentioned, we are confirming our 2022 operating earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and are also providing third quarter earnings guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. While we're disappointed in our relative stock price performance since our first quarter call, given the progress we have made over the last years on many fronts, we're confident that our superior assets and clear strategy place us on strong footing to perform well in the future. With that, we'll go ahead and open the line for your questions. As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So no surprise, I'm going to start with a pension question here, if I may. I guess what sort of proposed changes to rate treatment would you be exploring for your pension to sort of moderate the volatility in between cases? What could that look like? I mean have you started any dialogues with the commissions on this ahead of the filings?  And then just as a follow-up, would you consider moving away from sort of that MTM accounting and towards maybe the smoothing of actual gains and losses like some of your peers do, whether that's the quarter method or some other approach. Jon Taylor : Shar, this is John. So I think we've had some internal discussions about this. We have not talked to any of the regulatory commissions about this. But it is something that we're looking at, and we're trying to figure out mechanisms that can protect the company from the volatility that we're seeing today.  And so nothing necessarily set in stone, but looking for like tracking mechanisms or some type of deferral mechanism that could protect the utilities from the volatility that we're seeing. And then to your second question, when we adopted the mark-to-market accounting, I think back in the 2010/'11 time frame, that was a preferred method of accounting, and so we can't go back to another method. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I know, obviously, you reiterated the 6% to 8% growth rate, and we clearly see the strategy you guys have laid out to try and mitigate the pension-driven headwinds. But $0.30 drag is still somewhat material in the near term. Just all else equal, if the $0.30 ends up being the final number, I guess, where would that kind of put you in terms of that 6% to 8%, at least at the front end knowing some of these mitigation measures you could be deploying? Steven Strah : Shar, before I turn it over to Jon for a couple of comments, I just wanted to, on an overall basis, just acknowledge it's a very fluid situation for us. We have put a plan together that Jon outlined in his prepared remarks, and it's up to us to work it. We continue to be very clear and transparent in our disclosures. And during the first quarter call, we were very upfront and straightforward about the challenge. We also have found a way to find a path forward. And we're going to continue to be very transparent on the issue. There are some things within our plan that are within our control, some outside of our control. As I said, it's fluid.  And look, we're going to be committed to do what's reasonable to address the gap, but be careful that we're not going to unduly impact our customers' experience with us and get our company off track. So I just wanted to make those introductory comments before I turn it back over to Jon. Jon Taylor : Yes. And Shar, I'm not going to obviously commit to low end or high end of the 6% to 8%. But what I would tell you is this, it's a very volatile situation. In fact, if you just look through the month of July, given the broader markets are up, there's been some softening in the interest rates.  The earnings headwind associated with the pension has improved. At the same time, our funded status has also improved. So it's a very volatile environment and something that we're staying close to. I think -- let me maybe take a minute and talk about this in 2 ways.  First, if you just look at year-over-year earnings growth based on what we know relative to the pension, it starts with our regulatory strategy, strong formula rate investments across transmission and distribution as well as the rate structures we have in place from the Ohio SEET settlement that provides really strong regulatory earnings growth.  Next year, you'll also start to see the full year of the interest savings from the holdco debt reduction initiatives, which is about $0.18 a share annually. That will start to flow through beginning next year. Obviously, that's going to be partially offset by new debt issuances, but it will be a benefit to year-over-year earnings. And then as I mentioned, we have planned operating efficiencies from FE Forward as well as the benefits from the tender transaction and the investment earnings on the corporate side, the mining operation where it's giving us flexibility to pull ahead some planned maintenance work this year from future years.  And then the remainder of the issue will be addressed by optionality across a broad spectrum of initiatives, including increased capital investments on the transmission system, permanent reductions in corporate and support costs, for instance, external branding and communication cost as well as reducing our real estate footprint. And then we might even have uplift from the mining operation next year that we would consider that's not on our plan.  So I say that because I think the most important way to maybe look at it is what's changed relative to our plan to deal with the $0.30 headwind? And I think you can kind of frame it this way. About 40% of the headwind will be addressed by the moves we're making now to move operating expenses around. 25% of the headwind will be addressed through changes in our financing plan. And then the remaining 1/3 will be associated with the reductions in corporate costs and new capital investments that I mentioned earlier. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just to kind of follow-up to the answer of that last question. Jon, you gave the buckets of kind of the offsets, but it kind of implied that those offsets might be enough to the degree that $0.30 is the right number because I know that number won't be set in stone to offset at least maybe most of that. Is that correct? Or is that... Jon Taylor : Yes. That's correct. I mean the items that we have in place around increasing our capital investments, permanent reductions in corporate and support costs, customer arrears, the improvement in uncollectible expense that we're seeing, we feel very comfortable. Based on what we know right now, as well as the changes in the financing plan, everything that I mentioned earlier, we feel good about the $0.30. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then obviously, you'll flex these, if that $0.30 becomes smaller by year end, maybe you don't do as much but you're kind of finding ways to manage this issue so far. Jon Taylor : Yes. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Good. And then second question is the comment on the value of private market values relative to public market. Could you maybe give a little more color on why you kind of highlighted that in the slide deck and what you might be thinking there? Steven Strah : Steve, this is Steven. It's really all around just considering the given success that we had with the FET transaction. And we're just going to continue to examine ways of creating shareholder value if it makes sense. Step one is to understand potential value. And it's something that we look at on very much a routine basis. And we do have the opportunity to create some new optionality, we believe, based on valuations and where those valuations are right now. And it's just part of our ongoing planning process. Jon Taylor : Yes, Steve, I would just add on to that, that we continually look at various options to create value. And if there are ways to be opportunistic to take advantage of the difference between public valuations and private market valuations, we're going to consider that. And I would tell you that utility asset valuations in the private sector are -- continue to be strong. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then -- that's helpful. And then my last question is just on the FFO-to-debt improvement kind of happening sooner. Could you talk to whether that has any kind of implications on the timing of -- you mentioned the Fitch going to investment grade, maybe the other agencies and also the timing of when you might consider growing the dividend again? Jon Taylor : Yes. So maybe I'll take the discussion with the rating agencies. We've provided them our new plan, which reflects the tender transaction, the changes that we've made in our financing plan as well as the mitigating actions that we're going to take to offset the pension.  And it clearly shows that we're going to get to 13% next year as we execute. But I'm not going to speak for the rating agencies. It's up to us to execute against our plan. Moody's has us on positive outlook. But as we talked about with them, it's really important for us to execute against that plan to ensure that they feel comfortable with moving to an upgrade.  On the dividend, yes, I mean, obviously, we're focused on dividend growth. I mean we realize that it's been flat for a couple -- 3 years now. And so as earnings start to grow, we will continue to consider dividend growth. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : I just wanted to ask again on the public versus private comments. You do have kind of a track record for doing this already at the FET level. So just curious if to see something similar to that transaction that you're exploring? Is this kind of like another entire portfolio review? Can you give us more details there, please? Jon Taylor : Yes, Nick. So we look at different options each and every year, just looking at all the assets that we have. We're not necessarily targeting a set of assets at this point in time. But it is something that we take a look at from time to time. And if there's, like I said, options to create value for shareholders that takes advantage of these high private valuations, then we're going to consider that. Nicholas Campanella : Got it. And then just back on the pension efforts here. You kind of mentioned working to kind of smooth these at the regulatory level. Just what states kind of have the most meaningful impact for like an ultimate offset? And is it really just like Ohio and then it would be a 2024 Ohio rate review item to watch? Or maybe you can give us more clarity there. Jon Taylor : Well, I mean, I think you could probably, based on the number of customers we serve and the size of the states, our service territory in those states, it probably mirrors that pretty good. So I don't have the breakout by state, but we've been able to do some things in certain states, New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland, where we've had recent rate cases, and we were able to get some different treatment there.  Ohio and Pennsylvania, it's been more traditional. In Ohio, we recover service cost only. Pennsylvania is based on cash contributions to the pension trust. So the exposure probably, you can just kind of pro rata it based on the number of customers each of those utilities have or each of those states have. But what we're really looking to do is try to protect the company from the volatility that we're seeing, for instance, this year. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : A couple. First of all, I noticed in the back of the slide deck, you did not change your capital spend forecast. Some of the commentary you make about pulling forward spend, is what you're saying you'll pull forward over the O&M into 2022? Or are you talking about pulling forward capital or both? Steven Strah : Right now, Michael, our plan calls for the pulling forward of O&M primarily. Michael Lapides : Okay. The other question is your regulatory section still highlight plans to file rate cases everywhere next year except Ohio, and Ohio in 2024. Do you -- are you filing those cases to fix rate design? Or are you filing those cases because you think you're under earning in all 3 of those states. Jon Taylor : Well, I think if you look at the ROE that we published for New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland, they're all sub-8% as of Q2 LTM. So I would tell you that I feel like we're not earning a reasonable return at this point in time. So I think -- there's nothing that I'm aware of that gets to rate structure or rate design at this point. I mean obviously, we have a little bit of time to plan and prepare for that. But this is mostly to earn a reasonable return on our investments. Michael Lapides : Got it. And can you remind me which of those states have forward-looking test years and which of those are more on a historical test year? And is there anything you can do to fix the ones or improve the rate making design for the ones that aren't historical? Jon Taylor : Yes. So West Virginia and Maryland, I think, are historical test years. So we'll likely use 2022 as the test year. I think New Jersey is a little bit of a hybrid where you use some historical, but you can project for certain things and project into the future. So I don't think there's a lot that we can do to change that in those states, but that's kind of where we are at this point. Michael Lapides : And in Pennsylvania, are you under-earning even though you're utilizing the DISC or do you not have the DISC turned on? Jon Taylor : We have the DISC turned on -- all of our operating companies have the DISC turned on. So at least according to what we published, we were earning about 8.1% on a pro forma basis, which includes the full year of accounting changes that haven't flowed through the actual results yet, but will over time. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to come back to the pension situation real quickly, if I could. Just to put a bow on it all. It sounds like you guys believe you have all the tools needed to fully offset the $0.30 headwind as it stands right now. Is that a fair way to think about it? Jon Taylor : Yes. Based on what we know today, Jeremy, we've identified everything we need to offset the $0.30 headwind. I would just remind you, just to -- it's going to be fluid, right? And so that's going to change from time to time, and we're just going to have to keep a close eye on it. And we'll be transparent with you on exactly where we are. But based on what we know as of this point in time, we feel like we can address the $0.30 headwind. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. And then just wanted to circle back to the management review process, if I could. Just wondering time line to conclusion there. When would we hear more? Do we need resolution of all actions in Federal court? Or just wondering what's the gating items to complete at this point? Steven Strah : Jeremy, as we previously disclosed, there was a management review committee created as part of our Board of Directors and the work is underway. So that sets off a 90-day clock to complete the review. And I would say I would be thinking around mid-September by the time it's completed. And the Board is following their process, and I really can't comment beyond that. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with the Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, a couple of clarifications here. Just to confirm, are you still guiding to be approximately $2.55 to $2.60 for '23, right? And I know you said things are fluid, but the '23 number specifically here. Jon Taylor : That's right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And when you say things are fluid, obviously, pension mark-to-market is fluid. Are the offset fluid? And just if you can repeat what elements are fluid? I mean I'd be curious, I mean, how do you think about the coal contribution, PRB prices seem to be abating here. Also, I suppose, the Pennsylvania tax rate moving around, is that kind of more of a structural uplift here? Just if you could talk to the offsets being fluid and then some of the components there, those two. Jon Taylor : There is some ability to be flexible with some of the offsets in terms of how we accelerate expenses from future years into this year. The level of increased transmission spend that we want to put in place. The mining operation is somewhat fluid. So there is some fluidness to all of this.  My point on the pension was mostly around -- we know $0.30 today, it's gotten a little bit better as of last Friday. But the markets are volatile, right? And the $0.30 could be lower, it could be higher. And so we're just going to have to keep an eye on it. But based on what we know today, we feel pretty good about where we are. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And so maybe just to clarify the fluidity of this. Because pension is fluid, you're moving costs around. How structural is that $0.30 offset though, right? I mean, maybe that's the other side of the step. I get that Pennsylvania tax rate benefit could be structural or at least into the next rate case. But what are the dynamics here, if you can think about that? Jon Taylor : So just real quickly because you mentioned it twice now. The Pennsylvania tax rate, that's not going to -- that's not structural. That's going to flow back to customers. So that won't be an earnings impact to us going forward. But a lot of the things that we're doing around corporate and support costs, reducing our real estate footprint, that is structural changes that we're going to make.  The improvement in customer arrears and being able to reduce uncollectible expense, that could be structural. The level of contribution from the mining operation, that's probably fluid, right, because a lot of it depends on commodity prices and the ability for the mine to execute against their plan. So there's a lot of moving pieces here. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the load growth that you're seeing, pretty good growth this quarter. And I'm wondering if there are any pockets of weakness or recession risks that you see coming up, particularly around the industrial sales or how things are shaping up from there? Jon Taylor : Yes. So David, I would tell you that we're seeing pretty good growth in the industrial sector quarter-over-quarter. I mean if you look at the last 3 or 4 quarters, on average, it's grown anywhere from 2% to 3%. And that's what we're seeing in the second quarter. I would tell you, on the industrial side, the trends in many of the sectors are better than what we saw in the first quarter.  For instance, steel was up 10% quarter-over-quarter versus 4% in Q1. Auto was up 7% versus 4% in Q1. So we're seeing a lot of trends move in the right direction, which we feel good about. And in fact, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, this is the first quarter we've seen since the pandemic that our industrial load was better than what we saw in 2019. And that was across a lot of different industries. David Arcaro : Got it. Just one clarifying question on the pension. You had mentioned the $0.40 kind of benefit goes down to a $0.10 noncash benefit. I was wondering if you -- how do you look at that $0.10 pension benefit? Is that kind of transitory and goes away over time? I know it's going to fluctuate, obviously, in the near term with the pension and with the markets. But is the $0.10 kind of sensitive to rate cases going forward, does it get passed along? Jon Taylor : So each jurisdiction has different rate treatments for customers. And so in the states that we file -- we'll file in next year where we'll use '22 as a test year, it will be at that $0.40 level. And so they won't see the change to the $0.10 a share next year. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Gregg Orrill : Just a follow up on the O&M pull forward. Just sort of if you could address how you've thought about supply chain challenges and inflation and labor issues. Do you have the labor you need? Jon Taylor : Yes, Gregg, I would say a lot of the work we've already started to execute on. And so we have the contractors and the labor to support that. That's not to say that we don't have challenges with supply chain. We're seeing a lot of different impacts, specifically around lead times, around equipment, across a number of categories, transformers, breakers, regulators, all have extended lead times. But this is more around just getting planned maintenance work done ahead of schedule and in '22 as opposed to future years. So it's not necessarily a contract or a labor issue. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Srinjoy Banerjee with Barclays. Srinjoy Banerjee : So obviously, congratulations on the Fitch upgrade. For the other rating agencies, any specific catalysts you think they're waiting for? I think Moody's mentioned sort of the Board level management review is one. And to clarify, just the FFO-to-debt number you're giving, 13%, does that add back pensions? Jon Taylor : Well, they'll use the pension obligation at the end of '21, that's in their metrics, which supports the 13% that we provided them. That's correct. But with respect to catalyst, I'm not aware of anything specifically that either Moody's or S&P are looking for.  I think it's just continued execution against our plan and seeing how the cultural changes continue to progress, the changes around compliance and ethics that we're executing on. All the recommendations that came out of the investigation and how we're executing on those will be important as well. But nothing specifically that they've said is a catalyst for the upgrade that I'm aware of. Srinjoy Banerjee : And just in terms of the use of proceeds from the various transactions, I think the total was around $3.5 billion, so both the FET minority stake sale and the new equity as well. You did mention $2.5 billion, of course, gone to holdco debt reduction. How are you thinking about the remaining $1 billion? Jon Taylor : Yes. It will be deployed at the operating company level to strengthen capital structures to fund their capital programs. So that's the plan. Srinjoy Banerjee : Got it. And should we think of that as sort of accelerated debt repayment in any of those opcos or does it more just sort of reduce upcoming debt issuance needs there? Jon Taylor : Yes. The latter, upcoming debt issuances. Srinjoy Banerjee : Got it. And then just 1 final one. You mentioned the potential for future asset sales or minority stake sales. How are you thinking about that in terms of what would drive the use of proceeds there? Jon Taylor : Well, I would tell you, given where some of our high coupon debt is trading today, I mean, it's very attractive to maybe continue to further delever the holding company, if you could. But I think we'd cross that bridge when we get to it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : A quick question on the Montana mining operation that you highlighted this quarter. You mentioned that it's not in the plan beyond 2022. Is that just simply not factoring in the contributions from there? Or are you planning to dispose of that asset or that investment? Jon Taylor : Yes. Sophie, just in our original plan that we announced back in November and February of this year, we didn't assume earnings contribution from the mine in '23 or beyond. We just had a modest amount factored in, in '22, and it's exceeding our expectations in this year. Sophie Karp : So the plan is to continue to hold that investment? Jon Taylor : Well, I would tell you, we've looked at exploring how we transition out of that facility over time. As you can imagine, it's a challenge to do something like that, just given the situation. But it is something that we look at from time to time, and we'll have discussions with the other owners. Sophie Karp : Got it. And then on the Grid Mod, right, the Grid Mod plan you filed in Ohio. Can you remind us the regulatory cadence of that? What should we be watching as far as dates and discussions with regulators or federal? Jon Taylor : Yes. So I would say, to be determined. I think the staff and the commission will need to set a schedule. And depending on how things go, that will drive the schedule. I can't give you a sense of the time line at this point in time. Sophie Karp : Got it. And last if I may, not to kind of beat this dead horse with pension, but just maybe I missed the remarks. Absence of different regulatory treatment that you might get later on, right, when you pursue it. Is there a reason why you cannot smooth out the impact of pension volatility just strictly from the accounting standpoint? Jon Taylor : No. I mean, because your pension is -- the pension just -- if you just look at the pure accounting, I mean, you mark the pension -- everybody marks the pension to market and sets pension expense based on the year-end market conditions. And so that's really what sets pension expense. And so if you look at just the interest component, you're seeing significant increases in interest rates. And then the assets are down 15%. And so that creates the volatility in the, what I'll call the normal pension exposure for us and, quite frankly, for other companies. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Strah for any closing comments. Steven Strah : Well, great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for joining us today and for your continued support, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Thank you. You may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.  We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that support today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year-to-date can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website.  We'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder. John Somerhalder : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. FirstEnergy continues to make significant progress in its transformation. Yesterday afternoon, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share and operating earnings of $0.79 per share. These results, which Jon will discuss in more detail later in the call, are at the upper end of our guidance and support our expectation for full year 2022 operating earnings in the top half of our full year guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share, assuming normal weather.  In addition to our strong financial and operational performance year-to-date, we continue to execute against our strategy to become a more resilient and forward-looking company that is positioned for long-term stability and success. We are building positive momentum through our ongoing efforts to strengthen our culture, rebuild shareholder trust, accelerate improvements of our balance sheet and drive operational excellence through innovation and continuous improvement efforts. And we are positioning our company to capitalize on significant opportunities for growth through long-term customer-focused investments.  I'm privileged to work alongside the strong leadership team in this interim role, and I'm confident that this team and our committed employees will continue to execute on these strategies to transform the company into a best-in-class utility. And we intend to continue this momentum as we transition to a new Chief Executive Officer. The Board's external search is well underway, and we remain hopeful that we can make an announcement late this year or early in 2023.  The key attributes we're seeking include a strong track record of executive leadership within the utility industry, a demonstrated ability to execute on the regulatory front, leading operational and financial discipline and impeccable credibility with external stakeholders.  Our Board is excited about the future of the company and is confident in the leadership team and our strategy. We expect to continue driving the efforts that are already underway to ensure FirstEnergy is built for long-term success, and it's our expectation that the new CEO will see the same strong future that we see for FirstEnergy. We are entering this new chapter from a position of strength. As we continue to focus on balance sheet improvements through organic growth and operating cash flow and our plan to sell an additional minority interest in one of our distribution or transmission assets, we will further accelerate improvements in our credit metrics. Improving our balance sheet to be on par with premium utilities will support higher levels of capital deployment to harden and modernize the electric grid to support the energy transition.  Before I turn the call over to Jon, I want to thank our employees for their efforts to move FirstEnergy forward over the last few years. They have been asked to step up time and time again to serve our customers, meet our commitments to stakeholders and stay focused on strengthening our company for the future. They continually rise to the challenge. Their hard work is helping us make great strides towards implementing our strategy and achieving our vision, and the Board remains committed to providing them with the support and resources they need to carry this company forward. I'm confident in the strength and talent of our team and our future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor. Jon Taylor : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you can join us for today's call. We continue to execute on our strategies as we drive strong operational and financial performance. I'll start my remarks with a review of some regulatory and business updates, then we'll move to a discussion of financial results and expectations.  Starting in Ohio, we are nearing completion of the first phase of our grid modernization program, which began in 2019 and included installing more than 700,000 smart meters with supporting communications and data management systems and voltage regulating and distribution automation equipment on over 200 circuits to help provide our customers with enhanced reliability and power quality along with greater visibility into their electric usage. We continue this successful work. In July of this year, we filed for our grid modernization Phase 2, a 4-year $626 million capital investment program, that proposes to deploy an additional 700,000 smart meters, distribution automation equipment on nearly 240 circuits and voltage-regulating equipment on nearly 220 circuits. It also includes pilot programs related to electric vehicle charging and battery storage. Together, these programs are designed to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power while offering our customers modern experiences, emerging technologies and opportunities to help lower their bills.  In West Virginia, the Public Service Commission approved a settlement agreement for environmental compliance projects at the Fort Martin and Harris power stations to meet the U.S. EPA's current affluent limitation guidelines required to operate both plants beyond 2028 as well as a surcharge to recover the expected $142 million of capital investment along with annual operation and maintenance expenses. We currently expect to complete this construction by the end of 2025.  These projects allow us to responsibly operate these power plants for the benefit of our customers in the state through 2035 and 2040 as we continue to support a timely and clean energy transition.  At the same time, we continue securing commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers in West Virginia to purchase solar RECs from our 5 planned utility scale solar generation facilities totaling 50 megawatts. As part of the conditional approval by the West Virginia Public Service Commission, Mon Power is required to obtain subscriptions for at least 85% of the facilities prior to filing for final approval. The customer response has been favorable, and we expect to reach the 85% threshold before the end of the year. Our expectation is that our first solar generation site will be in service in 2023, with others to follow by 2025 at a total investment of approximately $100 million. This progress coupled with other regulatory outcomes this year around smart meter and electric vehicle programs in New Jersey go a long way in executing on our strategy to improve the customer experience through investments that modernize the grid and support the energy transition.  As we think about the future, we are preparing for an active regulatory calendar in '23 and '24. We've planned rate case filings in New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia, all in the first half of 2023. For JCP&L, we last filed a case in 2020, and for West Virginia and Maryland, our last base rate case was filed in 2014 and 2018, respectively. The planned rate cases will primarily address our lower equity returns, as highlighted in the presentation, which are the result of the significant capital investments we have made since our last rate case and changes in operating expenses, and include the accounting changes that we have previously discussed, such as vegetation management and corporate support costs.  In addition, the New Jersey rate case would address our smart meter and electric vehicle programs. The Maryland case would address our electric distribution infrastructure investment and EV program. And in West Virginia, we plan to file for new depreciation rates resulting from a depreciation case to be submitted later this year.  Also, as you recall, our existing Ohio Electric Security Plan expires on May 31, 2024. Thus, we plan to file a new ESP in the first half of 2023, which will include a proposal around our generation procurement plan. And ESP also provides an opportunity for provisions regarding distribution service such as capital recovery riders as well as additional programs that can provide benefits to our customers, such as energy efficiency. In the months ahead, we intend to engage Ohio stakeholders in a discussion about our proposed ESP V.  As we've mentioned on previous calls, we have been considering the potential consolidation of our Pennsylvania and Ohio operating companies into 2 state utilities. While we continue to evaluate our options in terms of timing for a potential Ohio consolidation, we expect to file an application in Pennsylvania within the next 6 months. Consolidating these utilities will align with our 5-state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing needs. In 2024, we are required to file a base rate case for our Ohio utilities and we are beginning to explore the option of filing a rate case in Pennsylvania at some point within our current planning cycle.  Finally, in these regulatory filings, we plan to address recovery of regulatory asset balances, such as deferred storm costs, which currently amount to approximately $680 million across all of our jurisdictions. In September, Ohio Edison issued $300 million of 10-year notes at 5.5%. And we have one more transaction to complete this year at West Penn Power as we continue executing our debt financing plan. While interest rates have increased, interest expense remains manageable through 2024 as our new money requirements are minimal, and our debt maturities over this same period have higher coupons averaging near 5%. Additionally, filing for new base distribution rates in all of our jurisdictions over the near term allow us an opportunity to address the increased cost of debt.  We remain focused on improving the credit profile of the company. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $140 million of holding company debt in the open market, bringing our total holding company debt reduction to $2.5 billion this year, which is more than a 30% reduction from the end of 2021. Also, as John mentioned, we are pursuing the sale of additional minority stake in one of our distribution or transmission businesses. This would follow our very successful transaction with Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for a 19.9% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC that was completed in May of this year at a 40x PE multiple or 3x rate base for approximately $2.4 billion.  While we don't have any additional details at this time regarding a proposed transaction, we remain focused on accelerating our balance sheet improvement efforts in a cost-effective manner with a goal of achieving 14% to 15% FFO to debt much sooner than originally planned.  We had a robust discussion about the pension during our second quarter call and our approach has not changed. Extreme volatility in both interest rates and global equity markets continue. The discount rate that measures our pension obligation increased from 3% at the end of 2021 to approximately 5.5% as of September 30, while asset losses and our qualified pension trust were approximately 22% through the same date. Despite the asset performance, our net qualified pension obligation improved over $400 million from 2021 to approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter with the plan's funded status at 81%.  The potential 2023 EPS headwind from the qualified pension plan has increased from $0.30 as of June to approximately $0.45 as of September 30. As we communicated in July, we are confident in our mitigation plan to address the $0.30. This includes costs we have already begun accelerating into 2022, the benefits from our balance sheet improvement efforts, specifically the $1 billion of high coupon debt that we retired in June and the expected uplift from other corporate cost reductions and earnings from our legacy investment in the Signal Peak mining operation.  We will also continue contemplating longer-term regulatory approaches to moderate the impact of market volatility on our pension plan, and we would look for additional offsets if the outcome as of December 31 exceeds $0.30. While an impact larger than $0.30 would affect 2023 earnings, we don't plan to pursue shortsighted gains that could take us off track for the future. Our solid and sustainable investment pipeline focused on providing reliable service to customers continues to firmly support our long-term plan for 6% to 8% growth.  Our focus remains on controlling what we can control and creating value over the long term through regulated investments, operational and financial discipline and an improved credit profile. Our financial performance this quarter speaks to the continued resiliency of our business.  Third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share and operating earnings were $0.79 per share, near the top of our guidance range. GAAP results primarily reflect a onetime charge as a result of implementing recommendations from the FERC audit, which covered the period going back to 2015 and resulted in certain write-offs and expected refunds. On a proforma basis, excluding the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions, which are all unique drivers this year, our third quarter operating earnings increased $0.11 per share or 16% compared to the same period in 2021.  On a year-to-date basis, we reported GAAP earnings of $1.42 per share and operating earnings of $1.91 per share. Again, on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the accounting changes, the Ohio rate credits and equity transactions, we achieved a $0.17 improvement in operating earnings compared to the first 9 months of 2021 or nearly 10% year-over-year growth.  Third quarter results in our distribution business benefited from higher weather-related demand, the positive impact of our capital investment programs and lower financing costs. These benefits offset higher operating expenses associated with accelerating future planned maintenance work from 2023 into 2022 and higher material costs.  Total and weather-adjusted distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2021. Warmer summer weather and stronger demand from industrial customers, reflecting the continued rebound in many industrial sectors within our service territory, was partially offset by lower year-over-year weather-adjusted residential usage.  Residential sales decreased 1% from the third quarter of 2021 and a little less than 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. However, sales to residential customers remain higher than pre-pandemic levels by nearly 3% on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting a permanent structural shift in this high-margin customer class. Deliveries to commercial customers decreased 1% or close to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. And sales to industrial customers increased approximately 2%, led by growth in fabricated metals, automotive, food manufacturing, education services and plastic and rubber.  Third quarter industrial sales were down approximately 1% compared to pre-pandemic sales. In our transmission business, third quarter results primarily benefited from continued formula rate base growth associated with our Energizing the Future investment program and lower financing costs. Our ongoing investments in this important program have added more than $0.5 billion in additional rate base since the third quarter of 2021. Key projects currently underway include replacing more than 1,100 insulators along a 68-mile transmission line corridor in Northeast Ohio to ensure power reliability and resilience, a new substation in Ashland County, Ohio, to meet the area's future energy demands and supporting economic growth, and planning for a new high-voltage substation to support a data center campus that is under development in Frederick, Maryland. And finally, our corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from the Signal Peak mining operation and lower financing costs primarily related to our holding company debt redemptions throughout the year. With our strong results so far this year and our outlook for the next 2 months, assuming normal weather, we expect 2022 operating earnings at the top half of our guidance range. Additionally, we are on track to meet our cash from operations target of $2.6 billion to $3 billion this year, and improve operating cash flow consistent with earnings over time.  In mid-February, along with announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, we plan to provide you with 2023 guidance, along with updated capital and other plans to support our future growth. I too am proud of our progress to revitalize our culture, optimize our performance and improve our financial profile. We are energized by our transformation and look forward to taking the next steps to become a premium utility.  Now I'll open the line to your questions. As always, I appreciate your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Jon, just -- I guess, just given some of the pressures we've seen with inflation and interest rates, I guess, how much of the $0.30 of pension headwind that you previously disclosed have you sort of been able to offset to date with some of the O&M and financing moves you've done recently, especially as we're layering in Signal Peak, which essentially is printing money given sort of the coal price moves. And just on the incremental $0.15, you mentioned, obviously, you're looking at additional offsetting opportunities. What could those be? Jon Taylor : Yes, Shar, thanks for the question. Obviously it's been a very fluid situation with the pension. During the quarter, the pension improved $0.30 as of the second quarter to close to a $0.20 headwind at the mid-August time frame, and then it's ratcheted back up to $0.45. I would tell you with the moves that we've already made with our financing plan, the OpEx that we're accelerating into '22 and the insight that we have into Signal Peak's earnings for next year, at least the sales that they have locked in at this point in time, we've captured the majority of the $0.30. And we just have a little bit left to do on the remaining $0.30, which we feel very confident in. So with respect to the $0.30, we feel very strong about it. But like we said in our prepared remarks, if it's above $0.30 in a material way, we'll look for opportunities, but we're not going to take the business off track for the long term. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. And then just maybe a strategic question and maybe a little bit more theoretical. Just on asset optimization. Obviously, it's been a bit more challenging doing deals at this kind of like an interest rate environment. The buyer pool, I would think has shrunk a little bit. Are you still only open to selling a minority stake of, let's say, Pennsylvania, or could we see -- could we see you make -- could it make more sense kind of in this environment to look at an entire opco, which could actually expand the buyer pool to bring in more strategic versus just financial players. Obviously, some utilities are waiting for assets right now, but not sure they want a small stake in one. John Somerhalder : We've seen continued strong interest for minority interest, either in a distribution business or additional sale of transmission facilities. Since that has remained strong, that works very well for us, either a 19.9% interest in the distribution business, which has tax benefits or potentially with strong value we continue to see in transmission, even though there will be some tax consequences that has value. So that's the direction that we think makes the most sense and based upon what we're seeing to date, we feel good about that direction. Jon? Jon Taylor : Yes, I would agree. I mean, when we made the announcement in September, we had several inbounds from financial players showing strong interest in either a transmission or distribution business. We've had some conversations with several parties, and the interest continues to be strong. So we're continuing to work the process internally, and hopefully, we can get into a position where we can make an announcement either late this year or the first part of next year. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just for Jon Taylor, the pension, I know you probably don't want to get into marking pension every day, but the market's back to Q2 levels and I think it's up almost 8% this month. So if you -- and I know bond market's still weakened further. But just overall, if you kind of update it to roughly where things are now, where would you be relative to that $0.30 or the $0.45? Jon Taylor : The $0.45 -- Steve, I -- it's probably in the same place or maybe modestly improved since September. Interest rates have continued to increase. Corporate spreads have expanded a little bit, which not only impacts the interest costs on the liability, but also impacts the value of our fixed income assets in the trust. So I think it's modestly better than the $0.45, but not significant. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Great. And then on the CEO, the comments on -- that you made, John Somerhalder, on just what you're looking for in a CEO. I mean, those sound all great. And I guess the real question is, what's your conviction that you can find somebody and who comp -- that meet all these credentials from what you've kind of seen so far? John Somerhalder : The good news is the process is we've made good progress already on it. And we've identified more than a couple of dozen individuals that meet these -- the criteria could be very good. And I would say that the interest level has been solid and strong as well. So we anticipate that we'll have a shorter list but still a list approaching 10 individuals that both are very well qualified, fit very well with our strategy and have interest at this point. We're encouraged at this point. Steven Fleishman : Okay. That's good. And then lastly, just on the continued balance sheet progress. Any sense from the standpoint of the rating agencies on the potential for getting upgraded to investment grade, either late this year, by the end of the year, I guess, Jon? Jon Taylor : Yes. We talked to them just a few days ago, and the conversation was constructive. I think we continue to execute against the plan that we provided them. And we continue to have conversations on timing. I think they're just waiting for -- just want to see us continue to execute. They are interested in what we're going to do with the minority interest sale and how that improves the metrics. And once we get into a place where we can make an announcement, we'll put that into the forecast and start having conversations in. But the conversations have been very constructive. I think it's just a matter of time. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Maybe just starting on the pension first. I was just wondering, could you consider selling part of the pension? And then -- or is there a regulatory approach that you could pursue? We saw a PEG in New Jersey filed a request with the BPU with a different way to consider accounting for the pension there. I'm wondering if either of those might be feasible options that you're looking at? Jon Taylor : Yes. So Dave, I think for us to -- I don't know if we were to try to sell the pension obligation, I mean, given its funded status, that might be a little bit of a challenge to offload that obligation to like an insurance company or something like that. So I'm not sure that would be something that we would pursue.  With respect to regulatory mechanisms as we file base distribution cases over the course of the next couple or 3 years, we will absolutely look at ways that we can limit volatility exposure in the pension plan at our regulated companies. So that is something that is definitely on the table at this point in time. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then -- in the slides, you had mentioned 20 to 40 bps of FFO to debt impact coming from AMT. And I was just wondering, would you consider that to be kind of structurally permanent going forward? Or are there potential offsets that you could find on the cash flow forecast to help with that drag coming from AMT? Jon Taylor : Yes. So I mean obviously, we need much more clarity from the internal revenue service on the mechanics of the minimum tax. I mean the 20 to 40 basis points is not significant in the grand scheme of things when you think about FFO approaching $3 billion to $3.3 billion over the course of the next handful of years. So obviously for opportunities to offset that either through regulatory mechanisms or just further refinement in our operations. But I think to understand the final impact or the real impact, we just need a little bit more clarity from the IRS. John Somerhalder : And David, I'd mention that we do see that impact as we move forward, but we have the other positives of just when we look at our ability to fund capital and increasing capital, we have enough cash to pay dividends, do that and the balance sheet improves moving forward.  So just our plan, we'll continue to improve the balance sheet as we move forward. And then obviously, the minority interest sale further accelerates that. So we do have other very positive ways to move the balance sheet where it needs to be even with this 20 to 40 basis points of impact from AMT. David Arcaro : Yes, definitely smaller than some of the big positive changes that you're looking for. Jon Taylor : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Real quick on Ohio, can you just remind us with the ESP expiring late May next year? And also the potential for having to file a coal-blowing rate case at some point, do you think about -- in your conversation with stakeholders there, whether there's potential for a global settlement of some kind where you wrap all of those things into one kind of multiyear rate-making regime and rather than have potentially kind of 2 different proceedings or dockets and kind of somehow resolving for long -- to kind of create more long-term uncertainty about the regulatory work in the state. Jon Taylor : Yes. Well, so Michael, thanks for the question. So I would tell you that we'll file the ESP V sometime next year. We have to make sure that we have a plan to procure generation for our customers beginning in June of '24. We also need to make sure that we have clarity on the capital recovery riders that we have in place and any other types of programs that will provide service to customers like our grid modernization program, any types of energy efficiency programs that we want to put in place.  So I kind of see these as 2 separate work streams [indiscernible] ESP V, which needs to be approved before we get into the June 2024 time period. And then with the rate case that we have to file in May of '24, obviously, we have a history of settling. But given where we are right now, my sense is that's going to be a fully litigated case and might take us out into the late '25 time frame before we get final approval on that. Michael Lapides : Got it. Super helpful. And then one thing on Signal Peak. I mean, you've benefited from what's happened to commodity prices, although we had a bit of a pullback over the last couple of months and part of that is macro or trying to shut in a number of things. Is there a scenario where you look at yourself and say, you're not the logical owner of that stake? And how should we think about the market robustness for something like your state and Signal Peak as well as the tax claim applications or implications for you all if you were to be a seller of that state. Jon Taylor : Yes. I wouldn't say the market is robust for that type of asset. Even with commodity prices where they are, I wouldn't consider it a robust market. We've had some interest in terms of people calling us about the asset. But as we started the dialogue, it just didn't make sense. And we're continuing to be open to those types of transactions and those types of discussions. But at this point in time, I wouldn't consider it robust. Michael Lapides : Got it. And last one. Can you remind me what's the capital you're deploying in West Virginia to meet the environmental requirements? And are you getting a forward-looking or historical-looking cash return on that? Jon Taylor : It's a $140 million capital investment for the affluent limit guidelines. And I think it's in the form of a surcharge that will be covered based on the capital you spend. John Somerhalder : Yes. And importantly, I believe the depreciation rate for those dollars are in line with what we see as a logical end of life closer to 2035 or 2040 for the 2 plants. So we have that positive as well. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, I know things are going real fine here in parallel with the New Jersey BPU. Can you comment at all about offshore opportunities here? It seems like you may have just won in recent minutes here, a decent chunk on that effort here. But can you comment as best you understand in your position here, I get that this is happening literally in real time, but any commentary or initial thoughts? Or at least provide some perspective about what you guys already felt, if you can? John Somerhalder : Yes. It is happening in real time. I mean we have not yet reviewed the order or the details, but we do understand that our proposal has been successful to a large extent and something potentially approaching $1 billion of investment over the next 8 to 10 years, which we view as very positive and additive to our plan and why it's so important to have our balance sheet, the strength that we're targeting. So we're pleased with that.  We're very happy to be a part of meeting New Jersey's clean energy needs in a way that really works for the customers. And we're using more existing -- we're using existing right-of-way impacts or less. So we're very positive, but we'll need to review the order and make sure we have more detail like you said, Julien, it's late breaking. And I'd ask Jon, Sam or to update if there's anything else that I missed on that. Jon Taylor : No, I think I don't have anything else. I mean, obviously, it would be incremental to the plan that we have provided to investors. I think the capital would probably start being deployed sometime in 2024, '25, potentially. So in the last couple of years of our current planning cycle but would be an uplift to our plan going forward. So we're excited about that. But yes, we just -- like John said, need to review the order and make sure we understand it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Understood. Thank you guys for at least attempting to broach that one here. Meanwhile, back to the schedule program. On 2023, I know there's been a lot of talk about pension here and the puts and takes. But can we talk about 2 other comments. First off, Pennsylvania, as best I understand this is the first time we've seen you guys indicate your filing for a case. Can you talk about, a, just how much of 2023 we could see an uplift? I mean you document in your slides here, earning a high 7% earned ROE. How swiftly could we see that improve potentially? Again, I don't want to prejudge a rate case outcome, but certainly some potential revenue deficiency is there. How much of an offset could that be to the $0.45?  And in tandem, I know in the Q that was discussed this allocation question on the new methodology that you guys have implemented. And it seems like that's shifting some CapEx to expense. Can you comment a little bit more prospectively on how much more expense that would drive in '23 onwards versus your earlier rate base and CapEx forecast? It's not entirely clear here. Jon Taylor : Yes. Okay, Julien. So let me maybe just take those one at a time. So with respect to Pennsylvania, we're going to file 3 cases next year, New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland. My sense is we'll file those sometime in the first part of next year, you probably won't see new rates until the end of next year or first part of '24 as part of those cases. So I'm not anticipating really any uplift from those 3 cases in the plan for next year, probably start rates effective sometime in '24.  With respect to Pennsylvania, we said we're considering to file a case. The thing about Pennsylvania, it's a forward-looking test year. So we could file that sometime late next year, first part of '24 with rates effective probably 6 to 9 to 12 months thereafter. So I don't anticipate anything from Pennsylvania next year given our current regulatory plan.  With respect to the cost allocations, that's the accounting changes that we've been talking about since late last year, Julien, where we reclassified certain of our costs from capital -- corporate support costs from capital to O&M. That's already in the plan. That's already in the 6% to 8% growth. So there's not going to be any impact from that going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Actually, and then just with respect to Pennsylvania, presumably, that also enables you to accelerate some of the capital spend there and some considerations maybe around enabling the [indiscernible] . Jon Taylor : Yes. So the current LTIP program expires at the end of '24. So obviously, we would have to file another application to expand the LTIP beyond that period. So I think all of that would happen together. And I do see Pennsylvania as an area where we could start to increase our CapEx there just given some reliability enhancements that we want to make. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Thank you, guys. Good luck with the search. John Somerhalder : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Our next question come from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Angie Storozynski : So first, on Pennsylvania, the likely consolidation of your distribution companies there. Do you need to have that done before you potentially sell a minority stake in these businesses? Jon Taylor : You don't have to have it done. If you were going to explore, like, for instance, a minority interest in our Pennsylvania business, you could do it at the same time, right? You could probably make a filing to consolidate the Pennsylvania companies and file an application to sell a minority interest. Maybe not exactly at the same time, maybe one, the consolidation first, but then the minority interest sale slightly or shortly thereafter, but you could do it commensurate. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then separately, as you pointed out, you have this very busy regulatory calendar for the next 3 years. And it happens at a time when regulators are scrutinizing the affordability of electric bills. I mean, how do you plan to address this issue? And how do you think it is likely to impact the outcome of those proceedings? Jon Taylor : Yes. So the 3 states that we file in next year, if you just look at our total customer bills on a residential basis, we're probably 30 -- 15% to 30% lower than the peers in those state. And so we feel like we have a good story to tell in terms of our customer bills. We recognize that generation prices are increasing. But at the same time, I think it's important to make sure that you have strong and financially healthy utilities to make sure that we can provide the level of service that's needed given the fact that customer expectations are only increasing as we transition to more electrification. So I feel like we have a good story, but we do recognize the concern that you mentioned. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then lastly, is there any update on the pending SEC investigation? Jon Taylor : On the pending SEC investigation. No update at this point in time. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : I just wanted to come back to the pension headwind and '23 and kind of recognizing fact that you reaffirm the long-term 6 to 8 CAGR still. Can you just give us a sense of just overall kind of confidence level in maintaining this into '24 and '25. And what are the drivers that you see that kind of keep you in that 6 to 8 kind of range? I know you kind of brought up new rate filings and obviously, there's interest expense reductions from the debt paydown strategy. But could you just give us a better sense of your overall confidence level on the CAGR, please? Jon Taylor : Yes. I mean, I think we've tried to highlight that previously. We feel really good about the plan for next year and beyond. I mean, obviously, we're moving some expenses around this year to help offset '23, which gives us a lot of flexibility going into next year. We're going to have the permanent benefits associated with the debt tender transactions that we previously completed.  And then we have line of sight into Signal Peak's earnings for next year, at least a modest portion of what they plan to contribute to the company. And then we have other opportunities as we've highlighted before around corporate cost reductions, whether it be facilities costs, in our communications, advertising sponsorships that we look at each and every year. So we have a lot of opportunity and flexibility as we think about the long-term growth of the company. John Somerhalder : Yes. I'd add to that. It's not only those items, but as we mentioned, getting the balance sheet where we want it, there's good opportunities, we think, in the benefit -- to benefit our customers on reliability and those type of issues to continue to invest in the business. So we see with our balance sheet strong, a good affordability position we start at, even though we'll have to take into account commodity prices being up, we do see opportunity to invest more moving forward and grow earnings from those investments. Nicholas Campanella : And then, Jon, you mentioned on Signal Peak that you locked in the sales largely for next year. So should we be kind of thinking about that earnings attribution as more fixed now rather than tied to commodities? Jon Taylor : Yes. No, I think I highlighted they locked in a modest amount of their production for next year at prices consistent with what we're seeing this year. So we do have line of sight into some level of earnings contribution for '23. So they haven't locked in their full production schedule at this point in time but likely get that done by the end of the year. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Paul Fremont : My first question is, does your planned mid-'23 Ohio filing, does that represent a change in timing from what -- from when you had originally planned to file a GRC in Ohio? Jon Taylor : No, no. So 2 separate filings, Paul. The base distribution rate case we'll file in May of '24. And then the ESP, we'll file for sometime early next year, first part of next year because this is going to take a little bit of time to get that in place and get that approved by mid-'24 when it needs to go into effect. Paul Fremont : Okay. And what's the difference then between the ESP filing and the GRC filing? I mean, aren't they essentially setting the sort of prices for the same electricity? Jon Taylor : So the ESP, the electric security plan, is a more broad plan that deals with generation service that you're going to be providing to customers, how you're going to procure those services from third-party suppliers, but also allows you to look at your current riders, distribution capital recovery riders, other programs that you want to provide to customers. So it's really everything but distribution rates and distribution rates would be part of the base rate case in '24, which likely won't go into effect at the earliest until sometime late '25. Paul Fremont : And then can you quantify what the Signal Peak contribution is expected to be for the full year '22? Jon Taylor : It will be north of $0.20, probably somewhere $0.20 to $0.25 is what I'm guessing. Paul Fremont : Okay. And last question for me. If you file to consolidate the Pennsylvania operations, do you plan any type of capital contribution to Met-Ed and Penelec before that happens? Jon Taylor : We haven't contemplated that, Paul. If I look at the capital to the equity ratios in those businesses today, they're probably high 40s, if not in the low 50% range. So I wouldn't see a need to make any type of capital contributions into those companies. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sophie Karp : First, I wanted to ask you about O&M. Absent new rate, how much offset do you have the higher costs, excluding pension headwinds, right? So from inflationary pressures, are there any mechanisms that you have now that could help you with those? Or do you have to just manage and absorb the increases until you get in rates? Jon Taylor : Yes, we don't have -- for our base, what I'll call our base day-to-day operating, we don't have any type of regulatory mechanisms to mitigate inflationary pressures or anything like that. So it's really us to -- up to the company to manage our operating costs in between rate cases. Sophie Karp : Okay. And is there any way that you could get interim rates when you file the queue of rate cases next year? Jon Taylor : When you say interim rates, are you just referring to some type of tracker -- so we've seen kind of ... Sophie Karp : Interim rates that are put in place until the rate case is decided to help with the liquidity situation now like is often the case in various jurisdictions? Jon Taylor : No, I don't think that is something that at least that I've seen. Obviously, we would explore that. But I haven't seen that before, especially in the states in which we operate in. Now I have seen companies get trackers, for instance, for vegetation management or other big spend that they have where they can defer costs over a certain level and then take care of that in the next rate case or have some type of amortization of those costs built into their rates. But right now, we would have to file for a case and then get those types of mechanisms in place going forward. Sophie Karp : Great. Got it. And then on the Pennsylvania utilities, if you would contemplate validating those operations, right? Would that happen concurrently with filing rate cases before or after? How would that, I guess, will work together? Jon Taylor : Yes. My sense is we'll file to consolidate first, right? So we're going to -- we'll plan to file sometime within the next couple or 3 months or 6 months, and then we'll likely file a rate case at some point after that. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Just a follow-up on the offshore wind in New Jersey. What return would you be allowed in the transmission that you were talking about? Jon Taylor : Yes, so Gregg, in the filing, we filed a 10.2% return on equity. So that was what was in our filing. Gregg Orrill : And how are you thinking about that 20% equity stake option in the project? Jon Taylor : Yes. Obviously, that gives us optionality. We have the option to buy into the offshore component of the project. So that definitely gives us another opportunity to invest in a transmission like investment. John Somerhalder : Yes. But we have not made any final decisions on that. I think that's a good option for us to evaluate for our Board to consider but we have not made final decisions on that. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Somerhalder for any closing comments. John Somerhalder : Yes. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your continued support and we look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Conference next month. Operator : This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Irene Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year, can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder. John Somerhalder : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had a strong year in 2022, and we are excited to make even more progress on our goals in 2023. Our full year 2022 GAAP earnings are $0.71 per share and operating earnings are $2.41 per share, which is slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Before I get started today, I would like to take a minute to say thank you to all of our employees for their efforts over the past year. I'm proud of what they've accomplished and company we have become. Our progress this past year is due to the efforts of our 12,000 employees who are serving our customers and working to make this company better for the long term. Thank you. With that, we have a lot of ground to cover today, so let's get started. Two years ago, we were taking some of the first steps to transform FirstEnergy. In 2022, we hit full stride, stretching ourselves to strengthen and enhance nearly every aspect of our organization. The scope and pace of these changes have been remarkable. Just to touch on a few of the highlights. First, we made significant improvements in our financial position. This includes deploying proceeds from the $1 billion common equity issuance that closed in late 2021, together with the $2.4 billion to 19.9% interest sale in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC that closed midyear to reduce debt by nearly $3 billion in 2022, most of which was at APICORP. As a result, we lowered holding company debt as a percentage of total debt to 24% from 33% at the end of 2021. On the operational front, we transitioned to a new five-state operating model and engaged in more than 175 projects across the Company to modernize the way we work and deliver a superior customer experience as part of our FE Forward program. At the same time, we continue to enrich our culture with an unwavering commitment to our core values. As a result of this work, we're entering 2023 as a more innovative, efficient and forward-thinking organization where employees are sharing ideas and working to move the Company forward. This year, we intend to build on our momentum. We're working to be a premier electric company with a strong foundation and a customer center focus that is enabling the clean energy transition. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield's Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion. This transaction, which is expected to close in early 2024, supports our plans to improve our balance sheet and for approximately $1 billion of incremental capital investments, which we believe will drive long-term value for all our stakeholders. And as John will discuss, our regulatory calendar will address the critical investments that support reliability and smarter and cleaner electric grid. We are introducing 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 6% growth from our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share, and it offsets the pension impacts we discussed last year. We are also introducing first quarter 2023 guidance of $0.56 to $0.66 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate, which represents year-over-year growth based off of the prior year guidance midpoint. I'd like to spend a moment to provide an update on the CEO search process, and I realize there is much interest in this important topic. Late last year, we shared the broad criteria that we were looking for a strong track record of executive leadership within the utility industry, have demonstrated ability to execute on the regulatory front, leading operational and financial discipline and impeccable credibility with external stakeholders. And we always anticipated a three- to six-month time line. I can share that interest has been strong. The process has been quite active since the beginning of the year and discussions among the Board and select candidates continue. The Board is committed to selecting the right individual to lead our talented team, and we trust you will respect the process through its conclusion. We look forward to sharing the announcement when the Board completes its work. In the meantime, we continue to execute on the strategy we have in place. The Board and the management team are fully committed to this path and the expectation is that the new CEO, once name, will be as well. It's an exciting time for FirstEnergy as we're poised to leverage our many strengths from our diverse assets to the transformation that has taken place since 2020 to the talented employees who are making the Company stronger with their drive, passion and ingenuity. I appreciate your continued support. We are concentrating our efforts on long-term stability and success as a leading utility. We will continue to navigate our path with the same determined focus you've seen over the last few years. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor. Jon Taylor : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I joined John in thanking our employees for their incredible work this past year. Their perseverance and commitment made it possible for us to navigate challenging conditions and make important progress on our goals. We have a busy year ahead of us as we continue driving towards our aspirations and laying additional groundwork for our future success. I'll start my remarks with a review of our top regulatory and business priorities. Then we'll move to a discussion of 2022 financial results and 2023 expectations. We have an active regulatory calendar this year. Later this quarter, we'll file for new distribution rates in New Jersey and Maryland and file an application to consolidate our Pennsylvania legal entities. Then by midyear, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia, an electric security plan in Ohio in an infrastructure investment program, or IIP in New Jersey. Broadly speaking, the rate cases will address the significant customer-focused investments we've made since our last rate cases in each of the states and provide an opportunity to bring our distribution equity returns in line with the industry average allowed returns. At the end of 2022, our weighted average ROE was 7.7% and while authorized ROEs ranged from 9.6% to 10.5%. Our current residential rates are 10% to 40% below our peers in the states we serve and we are sensitive to the pressures of the current inflationary environment on our customers. Our rate cases this year will ensure we maintain our affordability position while enhancing the customer experience, provide further support for low-income customers and support the critical investments for a more reliable, resilient and smarter electric grid. Each filing will address unique elements to better serve customers in that state. For example, the Maryland and New Jersey rate cases will highlight our plans to improve distribution reliability through incremental investments. In Maryland, we plan to file concurrently with the rate case for continuation of the electric distribution investment surcharge. And in New Jersey, our rate case will highlight our plan to file an infrastructure investment program by the middle of this year. These programs will focus on investments such as circuit resiliency and reliability, feeder sectionalization and distribution automation and substation upgrades. In West Virginia, the rate case will reflect our recently filed proposal with the commission to update depreciation rates associated with Mon Power's II coal-fired generation assets, which based on the depreciation study, would have retirement dates of 2035 and 2040. Any increase in depreciation rates would not take effect until conclusion of the upcoming base rate case. Turning to consolidation of our four Pennsylvania utilities, this is an important step to align with our new state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy. This consolidation won't represent any changes in current electric rates for our Pennsylvania customers. Those will be combined as appropriate over time through future rate case activity. In Ohio, our ESP V will adjust generation procurement for non-shopping customers after the current ESP expires in May of next year. In addition, this filing will address other regulatory programs and mechanisms such as continuation of existing capital writers such as the DCR and AI. And as we extend our commitment to have a broad stakeholder dialogue, we are considering programs that support energy efficiency, low income and additional customer-related initiatives. We also look forward to advancing the $626 million Ohio grid mod Phase 2 capital investment plan, which was filed last July. If approved by the commission, grid mod will continue our work to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power, offer modern customer experiences and support emerging technologies. As we make each major regulatory filing, we'll post a convenient and comprehensive summary to our IR website. You'll find this information on the Investor Materials page of the site and a new section named regulatory corner. Turning to financial matters. Our recent agreement with Brookfield represents an excited milestone in our progress to be a premier utility with a strong financial position and sustainable long-term growth. The $3.5 billion transaction will deliver highly attractive, efficient equity financing. The transaction is structured with a $1.75 billion due at closing and aligned with our investment and financing plans an 18-month $1.75 billion note at 5.75% interest. Once the transaction closes, we intend to deploy the proceeds to further improve our credit metrics and our balance sheet targeting FFO to debt metrics of 14% to 15%. The proceeds also supported more than 10% increase in our 2024 and 2025 capital investment plans. We're using nearly $1 billion into the CapEx plan, brining our target to approximately $18 billion over the 2021 to '25 period. Through this plan, we're targeting 75% formula rate investments and more than 7% average annual rate base growth beginning in 2024. We will use NOLs and existing tax credits to offset most of the taxable gain on the transaction, resulting in an expected cash taxes of approximately $50 million. Beginning in 2023 and moving forward, we expect to be a federal cash taxpayer at approximately $200 million annually. Our agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FET triggered a deferred gain on the prior 19.9% sale that was completed in 2022. We As a result, we recognized a $752 million non-cash charge in our fourth quarter '22 GAAP results. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 and on an adjusted basis, excluding unique drivers this year, which include the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions. Fourth quarter operating earnings increased $0.09 per share or 22% compared to the same period in 2021. In our distribution business, fourth quarter results benefited from weather-related demand, along with the impact of our capital investment programs. These results nearly offset higher operating expenses, primarily associated with accelerating certain planned maintenance work, incremental reliability activities and higher material and storm costs. Total distribution deliveries increased 2%, resulting from weather that was closer to historic norms compared to the very mild fourth quarter of 2021 and increased demand from industrial customers. Residential sales increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2021, but decreased slightly on a weather-adjusted basis. Consistent with our observations on the October call, sales to residential customers remain about 3% higher than pre-pandemic levels. In the commercial sector, fourth quarter deliveries were up slightly from the prior year due to weather and decreased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers increased slightly overall in 2022, they continue to lag 2019 levels by more than 4%. Finally, sales to industrial customers increased nearly 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, led by continued recovery in the automotive, mining, fabricated metals and steel sectors. Overall, industrial sales are trending closer to pre-pandemic levels with full year 2022 sales less than 1% below 2019 and fourth quarter 2022 sales flat to 2019 levels. In our transmission business, fourth quarter results benefited from continued formula rate base growth of 9% year-over-year associated with our Energizing the Future investment program as well as lower financing costs. I want to take a quick second to recognize our transmission, supply chain and materials operations teams, who overcame significant supply chain and other issues in 2022, investing nearly $1.4 billion in projects to improve grid reliability and resiliency. For example, we successfully completed the first segment of a 64-mile transmission line rebuild that will enhance service reliability for customers in Eastern Ohio. And in Central New Jersey, construction is only on two projects that will upgrade 19 miles of transmission lines and benefit 50,000 customers. In 2023, our transmission investment plan is $1.7 billion, and we have a long project pipeline ahead of us in this premium business. And finally, our corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from the Signal Peak mining operation and lower financing costs associated with the holding company debt redemptions earlier this year. For the full year, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share, largely reflecting the non-cash tax charge I mentioned earlier. Full year 2022 operating earnings were $2.41 per share, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Again, on an adjusted basis, excluding the accounting changes, Ohio rate credits and equity transactions, we achieved a $0.26 improvement in operating earnings compared to 2021, which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Our solid financial performance resulted in $2.7 billion in cash from operations last year, which is in line with our expectations, and we made more than $3.2 billion in customer-focused regulated investments and plan to execute our 2023 capital investment plan of $3.4 billion. And we met our 2022 FFO to debt target, executed our financing plan and achieved investment-grade credit ratings with Fitch and just recently received a positive outlook from S&P. The materials posted to our website yesterday afternoon contain an updated financial outlook through 2025, including our capital plan, load forecast and financing plan. It's our expectation that we will extend our outlook beyond 2025 later this year. As John mentioned, our 2023 earnings guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share reflects overcoming the enormous challenge we face related to the pension, which year-over-year was a $0.38 impact to our 2023 plan. The combination of accelerating O&M into 2022 together with lower interest expense resulting from debt reductions and earnings from Signal support our projection for 6% growth year-over-year at the guidance midpoint. Our focus is executing on our plan to drive strong regulated earnings growth, resulting in our long-term 6% to 8% growth outlook, anchored by increasing transmission and distribution utility investments. While pension and the positive offset provided in the near term by Signal Peak have complicated our earnings story, we are laser-focused as a management team to improve the earnings quality over time by replacing earnings from the Signal Peak and pension with high-quality core T&D earnings growth and the significant benefits associated with improving our balance sheet. In terms of other 2023 drivers, our expectation is for the continued strong growth from the investments we're making for our 6 million customers in our distribution and transmission businesses and an improvement in our cost structure, driven in part by the work we accelerated into 2022, but this is certainly an area we will need to keep an eye on with respect to inflationary pressures. And ending on another positive note, we are fresh off a recent Board meeting, where we discuss the importance of the dividend to our investors. The Board approved a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratio to 60% to 70% up from 55% to 65% previously. And we also expect to resume dividend growth subject to Board approval for dividends payable late this year. Our new payout ratio is more in line with our peers, and reflects the steps we've taken to improve our credit profile and our commitment to enhancing value for investors. And as I mentioned on Friday, S&P moved First Energy to a positive outlook based on the announcement of the asset sale and our strategy to use those proceeds in a credit supportive manner. We're pleased with this action, which recognize our work to deliver on our commitments. I'm excited about our plans for this year and for the future. We've taken significant steps over the past few years in a broad range of areas to move the Company forward from the cultural changes, the improvement of our financial and credit profile and the execution on our regulatory strategy focused on benefiting our customers. We feel like we have great momentum for the future focused on delivering value for our customers, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Before we take your questions, I'm going to turn the call back over to John. John Somerhalder : Thanks, John. We'll have plenty of time for your questions, but I wanted to take another opportunity to say how pleased I am with FirstEnergy's progress. As you've heard this morning, this team has delivered on our goals. They have diligently executed our plan, and they have exemplified our commitment to performance excellence. I'm proud of where we are as a company, and I'm excited about our future. Now, let's open to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Nick Campanella : Appreciate all the disclosures, a lot in the deck here. So I guess, John, on the CEO time line, can you just help us understand what the expectation is on the time line now? Should you have someone announced before the second quarter call? Can you kind of help narrow that down for us a little bit more? John Somerhalder : Yes. Thanks Nick. Consistent with what we've talked about earlier, which is not only the criteria, what we're looking for, and we talked about that as part of the prepared remarks, the time line that we talked about three to six months. Everything we're viewing now is still consistent with that. I can tell you that we've had quite a bit of activity related to the Board search process so far this year. It's been very active and that continues as we speak right now. I think a couple of positives are that because we've continued to execute as a company, we see good progress, and that's what we indicated that even though we were going through the CEO search process that we continue to execute on things like the FET transactions, that's been a very positive. Also, the Board has been very focused on getting the right individual. But saying that, we do realize that we want to address this issue, the Board has a high priority right now and is very active on concluding the search. Nick Campanella : Okay. All right. And then, I guess, you guys have done a good job like offsetting the pension headwind with the Signal Peak earnings, which do see material and just acknowledging your prepared remarks, those are probably more cyclical type earnings. So just as we think about the fact that you're going to extend the plan in the coming later part of this year, and the fact that maybe by '25, the Signal Peak earnings may not be there, just -- what are the offsets that kind of keep you within that annual 6% to 8% growth trajectory that you can kind of share with us if you've identified anything? Jon Taylor : Nick, this is John Taylor. So let me maybe take a few minutes to kind of explain how we're thinking about the long term. So if you think about 2023 ex pension and ex-Signal Peak, there's going to be obviously significant improvement in the earnings year-over-year of the business, mainly because of the actions that we took last year to accelerate maintenance expenses and the plans that we put in place for additional cost controls this year. The interest expense benefits from improving the balance sheet as the holding company as well as continued growth in our transmission business. And those items more than offset the decline in Signal Peak and pension that was close to 30% of our earnings in 2022. And now for this year is projected to be about 15% of our earnings in 2023. So, if I think about the plan going forward, I think what you'll see is above-average growth from the business ex-pension, ex-Signal Peak from new base rates and formula program capital spend in our distribution companies, the continued organic growth from our transmission business and then how we're going to deploy the proceeds in an EPS accretive way from the FET transaction. And so our current plan, pension Signal Peak is going to be less of a contribution in those outer years, representing probably around 10% of the total earnings of the Company. So obviously, what's going to be important for us is regulatory outcomes, cost control is going to be very important. And that, along with our transmission business continuing to drive significant year-over-year earnings will drive the overall growth of the Company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Andy Storozynski : So just wanted to ask about the CEO search. So John, I think you mentioned that there's an expectation from the Board that the new appointee is going to stick with the current strategy. So does that mean that we shouldn't expect any changes to your EPS growth target, at least 25% by the new CEO? John Somerhalder : Yes. I mean we view our strategy as very straightforward. What we're going to focus on related to investment in the business, controlling our cost, executing on that strategy, the management team very strongly supports that strategy. The Board very strongly supports that strategy. So yes, we're looking for a CEO that would be very much in line and be able to execute on that strategy. Andy Storozynski : Okay. And then the other, John, the -- I'm just wondering if you have any expectations for the ESP and then the distribution case in Ohio, given the backdrop in the state and then ongoing investigations related to HP 6? I mean, -- is -- how do you think about the potential earnings impacts related to those two proceedings? Jon Taylor : Yes. I guess from my perspective, there's a difference between the ESP and a base rate case, right? So the ESP is primarily focused on the procurement of generation services for those customers that don't shop. Having said that, there are some rider programs in the ESP that we will ask to continue on such as our distribution capital recovery rider and so those are important to us. But in the main, that's not nearly as significant as a base distribution case. I would tell you in our plan, we're not planning for anything extraordinary. We're going to file an ESP that's consistent with our peer companies in the state. And that's kind of how we plan for the future. Andy Storozynski : Okay. And lastly, I mean, if I understand correctly, you are growing the dividend, maybe as soon as the midyear, maybe a little bit later. So when you talk about the FFO to debt targets, those already account for the fact that the dividend will start growing. Jon Taylor : Yes, that's all in our plan. Yes, Andy, that's correct. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Yes, hi. Thank you. So just to follow up with a prior question. So when you kind of summarize the earnings outlook, is it fair to say then that the utility earnings and the parent should be growing better than the 6% to 8%, essentially while the\u2026 Jon Taylor : Yes. Go ahead, Steve. Finish up. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Now the other part shrinks. Is it -- and then what -- is that just because you're going to -- you've got the rate base growth and you'll be able to, I guess, improve you exceed this under-earning situation improve over the next few years? Jon Taylor : Right, right. So I mean, if you just look at the cases that we'll file next year, New -- or excuse me, this year, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland, all of them, except for Maryland, have fairly low return on equity. So New Jersey 7%, West Virginia, 6.6%, we're also filing for capital programs in the distribution business with the grid mod program in Ohio, we're going to file for an IIP in New Jersey. So, all of that will provide significant growth to the distribution business. You know about the transmission company and the robustness of that business and then how we deploy the proceeds into the balance sheet from the FET transaction will reduce otherwise incurred interest expense. And so as we look at the business ex-pension, ex-Signal Peak, you'll see above-average growth. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then I guess a question or John Somerhalder. Just on the CEO search, are you still looking for the same characteristics that you mentioned from the beginning? And I guess, the other question is it takes longer. Is there any chance you're also reviewing like strategic options separately as part of this, too? John Somerhalder : Yes. The requirements, what we're looking for, Steve, are very consistent with what we've talked about. We have not changed that. As we've said, we've had good interest from individuals that have that. What I can tell you, consistent with what we've said earlier is, the Board truly supports and believes in the plan, and we are really focused on finding the right CEO that can execute on that plan. So, that is the path that the Board is headed down. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. James Ward : It's James Ward on for Shar. How are you? John Somerhalder : Hi, James. How you doing? James Ward : Hi, doing well. Thank you for taking my question. We're glad to see in the slides that the 6% to 8% annual growth rate target continued beyond 2025, the recently announced FET transaction obviously gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of deploying capital, as you mentioned, either towards rate base growth or debt repayment, both of which yield recurring benefits to earnings. But specifically on the investment side, you've highlighted the step-up in annual rate base growth from 6% to 7% in '24 and '25, is 7% just 24% and 25% expectation or like the 6% to 8% annual EPS target continuing post 2025, should we be assuming that 7% rate base growth also applies annually post '25? Just trying to make sure we're thinking correctly about the drivers of earnings in that period, even though you're not officially guiding beyond '25 in terms of a capital plan at this point in time? Just high level. Jon Taylor : Yes, James. So I think from my perspective, the CapEx plan is increasing from $3.3 billion last year to over $4 billion by the time we get out to 2025. And quite frankly, I see that trend continuing into the back half of the decade. So post 2025, obviously, we'll provide you much more in the way of details once we announce a longer-term plan. But I do see the need for significant capital investments post 2025 to really support resiliency, reliability to support the electrification of different industries, continuation of our transmission CapEx program. So I do see that level and more increasing through the back half of the decade. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David Arcaro : I was wondering if you could speak to the Pleasants plant in West Virginia, just the considerations there around potentially acquiring that plant and how it could factor into the resource planning outlook in the state? John Somerhalder : Yes, David, the Pleasants plant has some improved environmental controls compared to at least one of our facilities. And the commission in West Virginia has asked us to look at -- could it make sense to continue to operate that plant as part of the generation that we would own to support our customer load. We are consistent with what we've been asked by the commission. We are evaluating that at this time. And I think we'll have some results in late March that will inform that decision. West Virginia and the load for the customers and the economy there are keen interest. So, we will work hard to see if that could make sense, but I can't prejudge at this time what the result may be. But we will comply with what we're asked to do there and do a good faith analysis to see if that could make sense. And we'll be able to let you know as we conclude that what the next steps could be or what additional steps the commission may take to further evaluate that depending on the evaluation. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I was curious just in terms of the offsets that you dug into for the pension in 2022, the $0.38, I was wondering if there's a -- or the $0.38 that you planned to offset. I was wondering how much of that ends up being one-time in nature and doesn't recur kind of what's in your control as to -- is there any of that, that you would see recurring going forward as a more sustainable source of earnings? Jon Taylor : Yes, David. So if you think about just year-over-year, the $0.38, I would say probably 25% of that is coming from OpEx that we accelerated from '23 into '22, our financing plan, which would be permanent the debt tender as well as the open market repurchases that we executed in the back half of last year. Signal Peak is a contribution to the $0.38 offset and then some other, what I'll call, cost initiatives and other benefits that we're driving towards -- round out the difference. There is some timing or some of those benefits that aren't necessarily sustainable into the future, but we are trying to put in programs and controls in place to continue to drive out costs throughout the entire organization. So that's kind of the way that we're thinking about it at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, just coming back to the rate base growth question. Just I wanted to understand a little bit more how to think about the net rate base growth relative to the 7% growth disclosed. And how do you think about that accelerating here? I know you said in your comments, you expect to revisit some of the growth later this year potentially. But just to understand like what the baseline is in terms of like net growth back to yourself from rate base and how that might accelerate here just to reconcile the core 6% to 8%? Or alternatively, how much of the outlook when you think about the 6% to 8% is driven by some of the under-earning improvement that you alluded to earlier. Jon Taylor : Well, maybe I'll answer it this way. So the 7% rate base growth, '24 and '25 supports the earnings of the 6% to 8% through that time period. And we continue to look at the capital plans post 2025 and based on some work that we've done over the last year or so, we believe there's even incremental capital to that to support the electrification support EVs and support other reliability and resiliency type of program initiatives. So, I do think you would -- you could see that annual CapEx number start to increase beginning in 2026. But like I said, we'll provide all that color in that detail when we're ready. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to clarify, when you're ready, that's the event later this year that you're alluding to? And then related to that, just the rate base growth, that 7%, what's the delta that's not owned in terms of the FET sell-down? Just to clarify that as a baseline. Jon Taylor : So yes, so -- so when we sell off the 30%, let's say that the total transmission business by that time would have $11 billion or so in rate base. So 30% of that would be owned by Brookfield effectively. John Somerhalder : Yes, that's a different 30%. If we sell off 30% additional plus the 19.9% represents about 30% of our total transmission. So the math works just like John indicated, but two different 30%s. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But just to reconcile the outlook here, you're going to provide a roll forward later this year that would include an updated CapEx look beyond '25 that should show an accelerating CapEx budget for '26 onwards? And just trying to set expectations on what that update will look like later this year. Jon Taylor : I mean, Julien, it's hard to tell you exactly what the outlook is going to -- I mean, what we're going to provide you. I think, we are going to extend the outlook, and we'll provide the normal detail that we typically provide when we extend the outlook. But I would just ask that we just kind of wait to see -- wait until that time, and then we can provide you all the detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : All of my questions have been answered, but maybe I can ask you a high-level question here. So your stated rate base growth and your EPS growth targets are consistent with what your peers -- some of your peers also forecast in much higher growing jurisdictions, right? And so Ohio, Pennsylvania, jurisdictions where you guys operate are not really characterized by higher population growth. And so with that in mind, how do you feel about build pressure going forward, considering that you will not have that tailwind of growing population and necessarily to help spread the pain, right? So how do you think about that? And what supports that growth on the ground? Maybe you can comment about local economy, something that maybe we are missing. John Somerhalder : Yes. Sophie, yes, that's a key point. The good news is in all of our states, we start out very affordable when we compare to our peer rates in those states, were anywhere from single digit up to approaching 30% more affordable in the different states. So it does give us the ability to invest -- and as everyone knows, we've underinvested in some of our jurisdictions. And so there's a need to invest for reliability and other things that really benefit the customers. So as you said, even without some of the high customer count, customer usage growth rates of some other jurisdictions because we're very affordable because we have these needs for reliability and other, we feel like that's very manageable starting with where we're starting from on that. And then, we do see that with electrification first of transportation, we will see, as we move out later in the plan out through the 5- to 10-year period, we do see load growth that can help support additional investments. So, that's how we view it, and that's how we view that we can remain affordable and deal with our customers' affordability issues even with this more robust capital plan. Sophie Karp : Got it. And then if I may, on Signal Peak, what is -- maybe if you can reiterate what is your kind of exit path here? Do you plan to can sell it? Or is it just going to naturally diminish in your earnings profile over time? And if you are planning to sell it, could you just remind us what the book value of it is and if there's a possibility of impairment and the balance sheet impact? Jon Taylor : Yes. So I mean, the plan does call for diminishing earnings contribution from Signal Peak. As we've talked about before, we have looked at monetizing our investment that has been difficult -- but we continue to look for those opportunities, and we'll continue to do that into the future. And from a balance sheet perspective, I think the investment on the balance sheet is about $60 million, so not significant given the size of our balance sheet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Just maybe two quick housekeeping questions. One is, I guess, following up on Sophie's question. Just in 2023, what is your assumption for Signal Peak in pension earnings? Jon Taylor : So, it represents about 15% of the total earnings of the $2.54 midpoint. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then I think on Steve's question earlier, Steve was talking -- you answered this question, I think the utility growth rates were maybe earnings will be ramping up as Signal Peak and pension earnings decline. Just how much of that additional capital that maybe is going into the utility is eligible for a rider refund eligible for rider recovery versus a rate filing. Jon Taylor : Yes. So, I think if you look at our plan, we're trying to ramp up our formula rate CapEx at about 75% overall 100% of the capital in the transmission business is formula rate, and I think we're targeting 50% by the time we get out to '25 in the distribution business. So a fairly significant amount of formula rate CapEx in the plan. Anthony Crowdell : And just lastly, if I could jump on the CEO question, bandwagon. Just over the last three or four months, the Company has made some great strides in transitioning or transformation for the Company. Just thoughts, John, on -- does the title move from interim to like full-time CEO? John Somerhalder : I wasn't expecting that question. My thoughts are we have strong interest. So my thoughts are that we're focused on concluding that and transitioning me back to the Board as what my thoughts are. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Sommerholder for any final comments. John Somerhalder : Thank you, and thank you all for joining us today. We very much appreciate your interest in and support of FirstEnergy. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now, I will turn the call over to John Somerhalder. John Somerhalder : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have accomplished a lot since our last earnings call and continue to build on the positive momentum we have seen over the last couple of years. Our first quarter GAAP earnings are $0.51 per share. Despite the impact of extremely mild first quarter temperatures, operating earnings are $0.60 per share, which is within the guidance range and reflects the continued execution of our long-term regulated growth strategy. We continue to position FirstEnergy for greater resiliency and growth by strengthening our financial position, enhancing our operations, optimizing the customer experience and transforming our culture. When Brian Tierney joins us as President and CEO on June 1, he will hit the ground running to build on these efforts. We are very excited to welcome him on board. Clearly, we recognize how important it was to find the right leader for our company. And in Brian, we have a CEO who understands our industry and business and is the right leader to drive our strategy and accelerate our momentum. I know many of you worked with Brian during his time at AEP and we know him as a highly respected executive with a unique blend of operational, financial and strategic skills and achievements. His strong track record of driving results is very well aligned with our goals at FirstEnergy. He has expressed his support for the steps we have taken to position our company and he intends to continue to advance our business strategy, building on the strong foundation we have in place today. We know we found the right person to lead our company. I know everyone is looking forward to hearing from him, and we will certainly give you that opportunity. He will have a busy calendar starting on June 1. In the meantime, I am so proud of our employees and their excellent work to position our company for the future. I know they will double down in their efforts to support Brian to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. This work includes a very busy regulatory calendar that addresses the critical investments that support reliability and a smarter and cleaner electric grid. Jon will review our recent distribution filings in a few minutes, but first, I will take a moment to provide an update on our transmission business. In early February, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion. And this transaction remains on track to close in early 2024. Brookfield\u2019s partnership in FET supports our substantial long-term investments to build a more resilient and modern electric grid. We have a $1.7 billion transmission investment program this year and that\u2019s increasing to $1.9 billion by 2025. The mild first quarter weather, coupled with strong planning and execution, helped us get off to a great start with our construction program. Our transmission capital investments of nearly $350 million are about 60% ahead of the first quarter of 2022 and about 50% ahead of our internal plan. Examples of this work include : upgrading an 8-mile 138 kV transmission line in Ottawa County, Ohio, near Toledo. This project, which is scheduled for completion in May includes streaming new, larger conductor that can handle additional demand, replacing older structures with monopoles and installing more than 40 new components and insulators, upgrading the high-voltage transmission line in New Jersey that is expected to improve system reliability for more than 3,000 customers. This project includes the installation of 53 new wood pole structures to fortify and strengthen the line and help prevent outages. And our transmission program is also facilitating the energy transition by connecting clean energy resources to the grid. Earlier this year, JCP&L completed a grid connection for a 19.8 megawatt solar project located at a former landfill property and not all in New Jersey that is now delivering clean energy through FirstEnergy\u2019s transmission lines. We are excited to continue making these types of investments across our service territory in support of the clean energy future. We are affirming our 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. As we discussed last quarter, the midpoint of this range represents 6% growth over our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share. We are also introducing second quarter 2023 guidance of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate. This represents year-over-year growth based off of prior year guidance midpoint. I want to spend a moment discussing our regulated earnings and earnings quality, particularly in light of the current contribution from the Signal Peak mining operation. While this is a legacy investment that we need or control or operate, it has taken on a higher profile over the last year. Based on our plan, the earnings contribution from Signal Peak in 2023 is expected to be less than 15% of our $2.54 guidance midpoint and the expectation longer term is that Signal Peak contribution will decline on an absolute and relative basis, representing less than 10% of 2024 and 2025 consolidated earnings, improving the company\u2019s earnings quality over time. We intend to continue providing transparency around Signal Peak\u2019s contribution going forward. Our focus is on our regulated operations, our state distribution companies and our transmission businesses and on improving the credit quality of the company. We expect significant growth from our regulated operations given current returns in our distribution companies and our customer-focused investment strategies across both distribution and transmission, which will more than offset the decline in Signal Peak and support our expectations of 6% to 8% consolidated average annual earnings growth. I believe we are on the right path to leverage our strengths and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Now I will turn the call over to Jon Taylor. Jon Taylor : Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Although we were significantly impacted by the record-breaking mild temperatures this winter, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong and on track. I will begin my remarks with a regulatory update, then I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results. Last month, we kicked off a period of significant regulatory activity. Since early March, this includes an application to consolidate our 4 Pennsylvania utilities, which is an important step to align with our state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy. We also filed rate cases in New Jersey and Maryland that support critical reliability investments, a modern electric grid and enhancements to the customer experience, while maintaining the lowest residential customer rates among regulated electric distribution companies in both states. Since our last JCP&L rate case in 2020, we\u2019ve made nearly $800 million in investments to modernize and strengthen the electric grid. The JCP&L proposal represents a $185 million revenue increase and supports distribution equity returns of 10.4%. It features enhanced recovery of storm balance costs, expanded vegetation management programs, recovery program costs related to AMI, in electric vehicles and a proposal to normalize pension OPEB costs. The proposal also confirms our plan to file an infrastructure investment program later this year. In Maryland, our proposal for a $44 million net revenue increase supports equity returns of 10.6%. It includes a proposal for the second phase of the electric distribution investment surcharge program, a pension OPEB normalization mechanism and a cost recovery proposal related to COVID and electric vehicle balances. And in Ohio, we filed our fifth electric security plan to support our generation procurement process for non-shopping customers, continued investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management writers and energy efficiency programs. The filing also includes proposals to support low-income customers and the electric vehicle customer experience. We requested approval for the new ESP to be effective on June 1, 2024, when the ESP four ends. We\u2019ve included a summary of the key filings together with news releases and links to the dockets on the new regulatory corner section of our IR website. We received a lot of positive feedback about this resource, and we\u2019ll continue to update the site as we move through each of the proceedings. Later this quarter, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia. And looking further ahead, we are considering the appropriate time to file for new base rates in our third long-term infrastructure investment program in Pennsylvania and we will file a rate case in Ohio in May of 2024. While each utility in each case have unique circumstances, we have noted that recent base rate cases involving other investor-owned utilities in Ohio have been resolved with equity capital structures in the 50% to 54% range and support of ROEs in the 9.5% to 9.9% range. These outcomes align with our plan, which includes the financial impact of our 2021 approved settlement that provided for over $300 million in refunds and bill credits to customers as well as continued rate based growth and the accounting changes that we previously discussed, all of which significantly lowered the returns at our Ohio utilities. I want to spend a few extra minutes on the recent generation filing in West Virginia, where we are working with a broad group of stakeholders to ensure we find the best outcome for our customers. Last December, the Public Service Commission ordered Mon Power to provide an evaluation of purchasing and operating the Pleasants Power Station, a coal-fired plant that we understand is currently slated for closure on May 31. The concept of a potential acquisition of Pleasants was suggested by stakeholders in West Virginia as a replacement for our Fort Martin station, which has a proposed end-of-life date of 2035. We responded to the commission last month indicating that additional time and analysis are needed to properly complete the necessary and complex assessment. Mon Power proposed an option to enter into an interim arrangement with Pleasants\u2019 current owner that would keep the plant operational beyond its May 31 deactivation date. This would allow the needed time to do a thorough analysis and evaluation as requested by the West Virginia PSC. On Monday, the Commission approved our proposal. We will begin negotiations with the plant\u2019s current owner. If we reach an interim agreement that we believe is in the interest of customers and FirstEnergy, we will submit it to the commission. And if approved, this would allow recovery of associated cost through a surcharge. If we can\u2019t reach an agreement that is in the interest of our customers, we will file an update with the commission. To be clear, we don\u2019t see it as a viable option for Mon Power to operate 3 coal-fired power plants in West Virginia. We will continue to work through the process with the PSC and strive for an outcome that best serves our customers, communities and employees in West Virginia. At the same time, we are moving forward with our efforts to support the energy transition across our footprint and we remain committed to our climate strategy and our goal to achieve carbon neutrality from our Scope 1 emissions by 2050. Mon Power continues securing commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers in the state to purchase solar RECs from our 5 planned utility scale solar generation facilities totaling 50 megawatts. This week, we filed an update with the Commission to begin moving forward with 3 of the 5 sites, totaling 30 megawatts of capacity and to obtain approval of a small surcharge. Turning to first quarter results and other financial matters, first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.51 per share and operating earnings were $0.60 per share, which is just below the midpoint of our guidance despite the impact of a very mild winter across our footprint. Absent the impact of weather, we were on plan for the quarter. In our distribution business, first quarter results benefited primarily from our capital investment programs, higher weather-adjusted load and lower operating expenses, including employee benefit costs and the maintenance work we accelerated into 2022. These were offset by a significant decrease in weather-related demand, lower pension credits and higher financing costs related to our financing activity in the second half of 2022. Record-setting mild temperatures this winter, with heating degree days 18% below last year impacted total customer demand by 8% or $0.12 per share. On a weather-adjusted basis, distribution deliveries increased more than 2%, which was very nice to see. Residential sales decreased 8% from the first quarter of 2022, but increased 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, weather-adjusted sales to residential customers are trending about 4% higher. In the commercial sector, deliveries decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to lower weather-related demand, but increased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers continue to recover, they lack 2019 levels by more than 4%. Finally, first quarter 2023 sales to industrial customers decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the chemicals, metals and plastics sectors. Industrial sales remained just below pre-pandemic levels, but we continue to see fairly strong growth in some of our other industrial sectors, such as steel, services and other manufacturing. As for weather-adjusted load, we do expect a positive trend to continue relative to our plan, especially in the residential class, helping offset some of the lower weather-related sales we experienced in the first quarter. Additionally, operating expenses in our distribution business reflect the continued focus on our cost structure, and we are pursuing additional cost reductions to further offset the impact of mild first quarter temperatures. Turning to first quarter drivers in our transmission business. Results primarily benefited from rate base growth of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2022 associated with our Energizing the Future investment program, offset by dilution from the minority interest sale in FET that closed in May 2022. As Jon mentioned, we started the year off strong with our capital investment program in our transmission business, deploying nearly $350 million of capital, which is significantly above our internal plan. First quarter results in our Corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from Signal Peak and lower financing costs associated with holding company debt redemptions in 2022, which more than offset the lower pension credit. Signal Peak\u2019s contribution in Q1 of this year was $0.08 per share, but we expect a slight decrease to its projected earnings for the full year due to current forward market prices for coal. While weather had a significant impact for the first 3 months of the year, it\u2019s not taking us off our plan. We expect to offset the weather impact this quarter as well as projected lower earnings contribution from Signal Peak through stronger weather-adjusted load, additional cost reduction opportunities as well as opportunities to optimize our financing plans. Thank you for your time this morning. We recognize we have some work to do given the mild winter temperatures this quarter, but we see this as manageable. We remain focused on executing our plan and creating long-term value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. Now let\u2019s open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. John Somerhalder : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Just a couple of ones here. We\u2019re sort of thinking about the upcoming Ohio rate case. Just maybe from a high level, what sort of \u2013 what are the asks there? Is it primary capital and rate base, deferred costs, O&M true-ups? Do you sort of anticipate something to be more rate-neutral? And kind of related to that, how should we be thinking about historical precedents with sort of a newer commission as we think about some of the key regulatory items like goodwill and how that may be treated differently in this upcoming case? Jon Taylor : Yes. Well, Shar, so if you look at the returns for the Ohio utilities, they have been trending down over the last few years. If you go back to 2020, we were reporting returns in the 13% range versus 8.3% as of the end of March. Obviously, the seat settlement that we reached back in 2021 impacted the returns significantly with those annual rate credits to customers, the accounting changes that we made around veg management and corporate support cost had an impact on our returns as well as just continued investment in rate base with about $1.5 billion of incremental rate base, which is over 50% since the last rate case, which comes with the associated increases in depreciation and property taxes. And to your point, if you look at recently approved rate cases in Ohio, ROEs have averaged somewhere between 9.5% to 9.9% and capital structures with equity between 50% to 54%. And that\u2019s really in line with what\u2019s included in our DCR and AMI riders that recovers our distribution reliability and in Grid Mod capital investment program. So I feel like we\u2019ve positioned the Ohio companies the best we can, and we\u2019re looking forward to the opportunity to file the case next year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then lastly for me, just obviously, it\u2019s impacting the stock a little bit this morning. Just in your queue there is some new language around potentially using hybrids. Can you just maybe expand on that, how it ties into your thinking around equity? Are you kind of looking at converts in the traditional sense or ones that have been utilized lately with some of your peers where the window to convert is shorter, it\u2019s less dilutive, you don\u2019t really get the equity credit? I guess, really, the question here is, are you looking for equity credit or not? Thanks. Jon Taylor : Well, I would say our first focus is filing the application for the Brookfield transaction and to get that closed. And if you think about that transaction, coupled with the other transactions that we\u2019ve already closed on, we will have raised $7 billion of equity or equity-like capital. When it comes to other instruments that you\u2019re referring to, we look at all types of instruments all the time to see if we can maximize or optimize our financing plan. and that\u2019s exactly what we do. If you\u2019re looking at our short-term borrowing rate at 6.5%, 7%, we feel like we need to look at opportunities to find cheap financing to offset those costs. Shar Pourreza : Got it. So just to summarize your language around not needing equity has not changed to the plan? Jon Taylor : Correct. Correct. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Prefect. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. John Somerhalder : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to come back to Signal Peak a little bit, if you could. Just wondering, I guess, beyond 2024, what\u2019s the run rate EPS contribution? How should we think about that over time? And is there a strategic plan for the asset going forward? Jon Taylor : So Jeremy, we\u2019ve talked about before. In our plan today, we see Signal Peak\u2019s earnings contribution declining on an absolute basis as well as a relative basis. So less than 10% of the earnings going forward. And right now, if you look at the price curve for Newcastle Coal, on average about $175 a ton, that supports that assumption. Strategically, we\u2019ve looked at that asset before. It\u2019s a very difficult asset to monetize, but it is something that we look at from time to time, we will continue to do so. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then just wanted to kind of dive into weather, a little bit more, if I could. And clearly outlined before, I guess, offset to $0.38 pension headwind, but then weather is probably a bit more of an impact on the plan than when the guidance was originally provided. And you talked about, I guess, Signal Peak weather just load additional cost reduction opportunities and optimizing the finance plan to offset weather. But just wondering if you could quantify a little bit more how you\u2019ve seen the weather impact versus plan for year-to-date or expectations at this point? And which of those buckets present kind of the bigger opportunities to deliver offsets? Jon Taylor : Yes. So the weather for Q1 was about a $0.12 impact to the plan. Absent the abnormal conditions we saw in Q1, we would be slightly ahead of plan for the first quarter. Now we have seen positive, what I\u2019ll call, weather-adjusted load primarily in our residential sector. We\u2019ve seen that trend over the last several months. In fact, if you look at the last few years, our residential load typically comes in anywhere from 1% to 2% better than our load forecast. And so we see a little bit of a tailwind associated with weather-adjusted load for the rest of the year. As you mentioned, we are looking at further cost reduction opportunities. You probably saw, we\u2019ve terminated some sponsorship agreements. We announced a facility optimization plan that \u2013 to consolidate real estate. And we\u2019re also being very selective in backfilling attrition, especially for our non-bargaining employees. And then we\u2019re also looking at our financing plan, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of how we can reduce short-term borrowings and we get better cost of capital associated with our debt financings. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So even if 2Q guidance was below, I guess, where The Street was, things are still kind of progressing in line with your expectations and these offsets can keep you firmly towards the midpoint of your plan? Jon Taylor : That\u2019s right. In fact, if you look at just quarter by quarter and if you think about last year, really what\u2019s going to help us offset the pension is some of the actions we took last year to accelerate operating expenses from \u201823 into \u201822, and we really didn\u2019t make that decision until the third quarter. So you\u2019ll really see the uplift in earnings beginning in the third quarter. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Hi, thanks. Good morning. John, maybe just \u2013 John, two Johns, Somerhalder, just a little more color on kind of the Board\u2019s thoughts on hiring Brian and kind of what you think he brings to the company? John Somerhalder : Yes. I mean as we\u2019ve talked about, Steve, Brian was always someone that we thought would be very good in this role because of his deep experience in this industry. also is time Blackstone, that was very valuable experience. So we always viewed him as a really good candidate. We were very pleased that early this year. We saw him as available. We did not before that, but we saw that he saw the great fit as well. So there was mutual belief that he could be the right person. And truly his experience around regulatory environment in Ohio, other locations, all of his experience around the best way to run the operations and optimize operations over time, all fit with our plan. The heavy investments in our wires business, our T&D business, and so the more we discussed earlier this year with Brian, the more we saw that is the right fit. And obviously, the Board really feels good about the fact that Brian will be joining us on June 1. We\u2019ve been able to spend some time with Brian. He\u2019s been very busy, but we\u2019ve spent some very good quality time, and I continue to be very confident that he\u2019s the right person and I\u2019m very confident in his ability to execute and deliver on our plan. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And just along those lines, there seems to be kind of \u2013 I know it\u2019s kind of hard to speak for Brian, but just there is been some narrative that maybe Brian comes in and like rebases the plan. Just any thoughts on like is that unlikely, assuming people are thinking rebates lower when they say that? John Somerhalder : Yes, Steve, I mean, we have spent a good amount of time with Brian and provided a lot of good information. Based upon my interactions with Brian, I\u2019m confident that he\u2019s committed to execute on our plan. Steve Fleishman : Yes. And then just on the whole issue with the kind of thinking about \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, just on the hybrid comment, I just wanted to just clarify that one more time. The \u2013 when you are thinking about optimizing the financing cost, this is more of like a hybrid that\u2019s focused on a debt-like instrument like TPL and Southern and Allianz [ph] and a bunch of people have just done and not something that\u2019s more equity focused? Jon Taylor : That\u2019s correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David Arcaro : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Noticed that another phase of the New Jersey offshore wind transmission need was issued recently, and you had success in the first one. So I was wondering if you had any early read, if you could speak to your prospects for this next round of transmission need? Jon Taylor : Yes, Dave, I mean, I think we will take a look at all of those types of proposals as they come up. We \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s too early to handicap at this stage our prospects. But something that we\u2019re very interested in participating in. We think we\u2019re well positioned in the state to provide value and support those plans, and we will keep the investor community up to speed as we progress. David Arcaro : Got it. And on coal-driven earnings this year and on Signal Peak, I guess we\u2019ve seen domestic coal prices notch down quite a bit since the beginning of the year. I was wondering if there is any view of a declining earnings contribution for this year, specifically versus what you had been originally contemplating in the guidance or do you have visibility into contracted levels that would potentially insulate you there? Jon Taylor : Yes. I mean we have seen some decline in Newcastle power prices or coal prices, but you got to remember that about 60% of their volume was already locked in at a fixed price and about 40% of it was indexed to Newcastle coal prices. So we have seen with those index times a slight deterioration in the earnings contribution for Signal Peak, but it\u2019s not nearly as dramatic as the decline in Newcastle forward prices, and it\u2019s manageable in the context of what we\u2019re thinking about for this year. John Somerhalder : Yes. I mean there are \u2013 there is a fairly big disconnect between domestic coal prices in the U.S. compared to seaborne coal prices. And the good news is the first quarter came in very much in line with what our expectations were. And if you look at the forward curve, even though it\u2019s coming down, it\u2019s very much in line and supportive of what we have in our \u201824 and \u201825 plan. The real impact we see is this year, the prices because of the supply-demand fundamentals, milder conditions in Europe, fairly robust supply from some areas that supply Newcastle coal, Australia and others, the impact tends to be over the next several quarters where we see the impact. And as John said, that\u2019s what we\u2019re putting together plans to make sure we have other ways to address that and stay on track with our plan. David Arcaro : Yes. Okay. Thanks. That makes sense. One more quick question for me. I was curious just with the New Jersey management audit report that came out recently, wondering if you could just give your view, your perspective on that and initiatives you might be pursuing in the state around some of the recommendations there. Jon Taylor : Well, it was a very comprehensive report. We\u2019re continuing to review the recommendations. I think we have an opportunity to provide feedback at some point down the road, and we will do that at the right time. But we\u2019re going through the recommendations. I think there are many recommendations that we will accept, but there are probably some recommendations that we will need to have further discussion on. David Arcaro : Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So, maybe first with 2024 and how you plan to manage your pensions costs. So yes, I see the OPEB and pension cost trackers embedded in the New Jersey and Maryland applications. The Ohio issue and the Pennsylvania issue won\u2019t be addressed for a while, you will have lower contributions from Signal Peak, as you just noted, and yes, I know that the market has recovered somewhat. But looking at your allocation, you have an issue on the credit side, right, with the investments at least based on the latest disclosures on how you allocated your pension accounts. So, should we brace for another weakness \u2013 another year of weakness in earnings in \u201824 associated with pension? Jon Taylor : Well, I mean, Angie, I think through the first quarter, the pension has performed very well. I think the returns were 7%. The discount rate had come down about 20 basis points. And we are tracking to that level as we speak today. And so in the plan, we have pension, the pension kind of at the same level we have this year, and we are working to get trackers to protect the companies from volatility in the pension plan in New Jersey, in Maryland and we will likely propose something like that in West Virginia. So, we are doing what we can to protect customers as well as investors from the volatility in the pension plan. But based on everything we know today, everything is tracking a little bit better than we had anticipated. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then changing topics on the other, Jon, maybe. Okay. So, we have gone through a couple of catalysts that were supposed to benefit the stock. The discounts on a relative basis hasn\u2019t really changed, I understand that we are still waiting for upgrades to investment grade at the holdco level. But is there \u2013 as the Board looks at what\u2019s been happening, is there any suggestions maybe to change the course, or is it just sticking to the current plan and then over time, the execution against the plan will basically be reflected in the stock? John Somerhalder : Yes. I think absolutely the latter. The Board strongly supports the plan. I mean we view this as \u2013 the most important thing is that we execute on the plan and continue to execute on the plan. I think our track record over the last year or 2 years related to the Brookfield first transaction, Jon talked about, the second transaction. What we have done related to even with supply chain issues, making sure that we are investing in our business and meeting our schedules on capital deployment. The Board really views that the steps we have taken to-date, the good progress we have made and continued execution on that plan is what will deliver the value and close that discount gap that you referenced. So, Board is firmly committed to that plan. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe first about the Ohio rate case that you will be filing in the not-so-distant future, I was wondering if you guys considered or is it under consideration to combine the three utilities in Ohio and what kind of challenges would that present if you were to request something like that? Jon Taylor : Well, I do think at some point down the road, we are going to look to consolidate our Ohio utilities just like we have proposed in Pennsylvania. The timing is a little bit to be determined. And so we are just working through that. But regardless of whether we propose to consolidate, you are still going to likely have three sets of rate books, right. And you will kind of get to parity within the tariffs over time. I think we have had other utilities in the state that have consolidated their entities as well as their rate books, and that took some time. The legal entity consolidation is one step, but then to consolidate from a rate perspective, probably takes several rate cases a few years, that type of thing. So, it is something that we are looking at and we will likely execute on, but the timing is a little bit to be determined. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you. And my follow-up is on West Virginia. So, the acquisition, the potential acquisition of Pleasants that you are exploring there, I don\u2019t know how to phrase it, but is there a way that \u2013 is it possible that if you could pay political price there if you decided to not go through with that? Like in other words, is it almost like an impossible situation for you where you have to acquire it? John Somerhalder : What we are committed to do is work very closely with the State of West Virginia with the commission. And they have instructed us to do this analysis. I mean we see this as \u2013 we all have an interest to make sure this is in the best interest of the customers in West Virginia, the State of West Virginia. And that because of the fact that the plant is a newer plant, has enhanced environmental controls, it\u2019s a good question that needs to be evaluated. So, we see it as an appropriate thing to do. We do need to make sure it\u2019s in the best interest of our customers and all. And so we see this as an opportunity to truly evaluate whether this is the right path forward. We are committed to work with the group or with all the stakeholders in West Virginia. Sophie Karp : Alright. Thank you for the comments. Appreciate it. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Thank you. Just following up on sort of the Ohio audits and the ability to \u2013 what is sort of the ability to maybe accelerate those? You have got the stay there. Obviously, it\u2019s not a process that you have set out. But is there any flexibility there to maybe get that resolved faster? Jon Taylor : Hey Greg, this is Jon Taylor. Those audits have been stayed for another six-month period. I think that happened back in February. So, you are looking at the August timeframe where they could potentially start back up. But in between [Technical Difficulty] and then there is really nothing that we can do to resolve those or to continue with that work. It\u2019s just really up to the commission who ordered the stay. And as soon as the stay is lifted, then we hope to get back to working to resolve those. Gregg Orrill : Sounds good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Hi. Good morning. Thank you, guys for the time. Appreciate it. Just first off, coming back to some of the FE Forward conversation, you guys alluded to it at the start of the call, whether that\u2019s real estate optimization or otherwise? Can you elaborate at least today on what that total run rate is? How much of an opportunity and offset the pension that is over time, say, in the outer years? And then separately, Signal Peak, was that hedged out to \u201824, \u201825, how much if any is\u2026? Jon Taylor : Yes. I mean so the facility optimization effort is probably a $0.02 run rate type of impact if you look at the lease cost, if you look at the maintenance costs, those types of expenses that we incur associated with the facility. So, it\u2019s not a significant driver in the terms of the level of O&M that we spend, but it\u2019s important. Those types of things add up. And with respect to your second question on Signal Peak, they will probably start hedging \u201824, I would say, later either this summer or early fall, which is consistent with their past practices. But at this point in time, that\u2019s open. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Yes. So, that\u2019s what I thought. Thank you. If I can, just pivoting the conversation back to where Steve was going earlier about kind of a longer term view. At what point in time do you think you come back with a little bit more of a longer term perspective? I also appreciate that you guys very carefully have focused on this targeted 6% to 8% sort of an annualized basis rather than having these multiyear CAGRs or what have you? But is there at some point where you give kind of a view that gives an extended perspective kind of beyond kind of the noise of what Signal Peak is providing, maybe that adjusts for the pace of rate base growth and reflect something that really is a buy-in from\u2026? John Somerhalder : Yes. Julien, I don\u2019t want to commit to a timeframe. Obviously, we want to get Brian on Board and get him ready to go with the plan and put his fingerprint on it. So, I am going to leave it as kind of a to-be-determined. But my sense is, we will give you that outlook at some point in time. But I just want Brian to come in and really get into the details of the plan and really try to drive where he wants to take the company going forward. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Got it. And if I can grasp my one other point, you feel good about the 6% to 8% perspective beyond kind of the Signal Peak \u201824, \u201825 period, if I hear you right? John Somerhalder : Yes. If you look at the level of capital investment that is needed across the system, yes, I feel really good about the 6% to 8% long-term. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Got it. Okay. Excellent. Thank you, guys very much. Have a great day. See you soon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Hey. Good morning, apologies for not yelling into the phone. But just \u2013 quickly just some more housekeeping questions, I guess on Slide 11, you talk about sales data, really strong residential sales at over 5%, slight industrial decline. I guess if you could just talk about the drivers of what\u2019s really driving the residential growth? Is it people moving into the service territory or EVs or something like that? Jon Taylor : Yes. So, the 5% when you have like extreme weather conditions like we saw in the first quarter, coming up with your \u2013 the weather impact and the weather adjusted impact, it\u2019s a little bit more of an art than a science just because of the extreme circumstances. So \u2013 but what I would say is that the trends over the last few quarters and quite frankly, if you look at our performance over the last few years, the trends have been favorable relative to our forecast in the residential sector, increasing 1% to 3% depending on the month, depending on the time of year. So, that\u2019s what we are seeing and that\u2019s what we are kind of forecasting for the rest of this year. John Somerhalder : Yes. I mean we have seen the right trend related to EVs and other factors, not really people moving into the service territory. But that\u2019s starting to drive, but that\u2019s a fairly small issue right now. Most of what we have seen is really just the trend over the last couple of years of usage residentially with people more working from home and other factors that have influenced it and we are now being able to take that into account with our weather-adjusted load moving forward. Anthony Crowdell : Is the industrial \u2013 and I guess I know that would be extreme weather in the, as Jon mentioned, are over science. Just a slight decline in industrial load, I think in your prepared remarks, was that more related to just one segment of the economy there? Jon Taylor : No. I mean we saw it a little bit like auto has taken a little bit of a downturn in terms of what we are seeing in the industrial sector. Metals was slightly down, plastic and rubber was a little bit down. But we are also seeing some bright points. Steel continues to perform very well. Food and manufacturing tends to perform very well. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix. Anthony Crowdell : And then if I could switch gears on Slide 8 where you give us a walk-through and maybe a little different path in Julien\u2019s question on the FE Forward to achieve. Just I think and you removed $0.05 of earning \u2013 of non-recurring earnings from GAAP to operating. Just how do we think about those charges as we work through the year? Is it likely that we continue to see those charges or do you think that one-time in nature, we don\u2019t really see a repetition of that throughout \u201823? Jon Taylor : Well, the $0.05 charge in Q1 was primarily the termination agreement for a sponsorship we had. You won\u2019t see that level of cost to achieve going forward. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Got it. Okay. Great. I will leave it there. Thanks for taking my questions. John Somerhalder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Hi. Good morning everyone. Anthony, beat me to it. I was going to say we will miss hearing your name bring the brown games, but I understand the decision there. Most of the questions were asked and answered. Just one quick on FFO to debt, I know you were at 11% last year. You are very clear on the 14% to 15% target over time. My question is kind of what\u2019s your latest thinking on when you might get there? Given the FET sale and some moving parts around coal, could we see that level in 2024, or is it going to take a couple more years of growth? Jon Taylor : No, we definitely have a solid plan to get there by 2025. I think a lot of it depends on the level of proceeds that comes in from the FET sale initially. We have \u2013 we will see 50% of the proceeds that\u2019s a minimum, but we could see more and put that money to work. And if we receive more of the money upfront, then there is a possibility we could be at that 14% level. If you net the receivable against the debt, we would absolutely be at 14%. But once we get the proceeds and put that to work, we will be in that 14% to 15% range. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Somerhalder for closing comments. John Somerhalder : Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We very much appreciate your continued support this year.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to FirstEnergy second quarter 2023 earnings review. Leading our call today is Brian Tierney, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings-released presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at FirstEnergyCorp.com. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. This is my first earnings call as President and CEO of FirstEnergy, following John Somerhalder, who did an outstanding job leading this company during a period of transition. I am thrilled to be here with you today and look forward to talking about our second quarter and year-to-date results, a dividend update, some discussion of why I came to FirstEnergy, earnings from key stakeholder engagement, and the outlook for FirstEnergy's future. Let's start with a quick look at the results we announced yesterday. We delivered 2nd quarter GAAP earnings of $0.41 per share versus $0.33 per share last year. The company reported second quarter operating earnings of $0.47 per share at the upper end of our guidance range versus $0.53 per share last year. Mild temperatures continue to affect our service territory, impacting earnings by $0.06 in the quarter. Cooling degree days were 40% below normal and 48% below last year. Pension, signal peak, and financing costs were negative in comparison to last year. Our results were favorably impacted by a strong focus on operating expenses and continued execution on a regulated capital investment program for the benefit of our customers. For the year-to-date period, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.83 per share last year. Operating earnings for the period were $1.06 per share compared to $1.12 for the first half of 2022. The impact of mild weather in the first half of the year reduced earnings by $0.18 per share compared to 2022, with heating degree days being 16% below last year and cooling degree days being 47% lower. The positive impacts of investments made for the benefit of our customers and operations and maintenance cost discipline partially offset the negative impact of pension and financing costs. Despite the impact of the mild weather, we are working hard to be disciplined about our cost structure and to have our investments reflected in rate base. As such, we are confident reaffirming our 2023 operating earnings guidance of $2.44 per share to $2.64 per share. Last week, our board declared a dividend of $0.39 per share, which is payable September 1. Subject to board approval, we expect to have one additional dividend payable this year. At that time, it is our expectation that we will be in a position to resume dividend growth in line with the new targeted payout ratio of 60%-70% which the board approved earlier this year. This ratio is more in line with our peers and reflects our improved credit profile as well as our commitment to enhancing value for investors. Many of you know that I recently returned to the electric industry. I decided to come to FirstEnergy because I thought the company had evolved from a business and cultural perspective to a point where my background and experience could help further that evolution and growth. I could not be more excited to be working with my colleagues to provide the service that is the lifeblood of modern living to our communities. The employees of FirstEnergy don't just view their service as a job, it is a vocation that they take very seriously. This vocation and the service we deliver are more important than ever. Electricity demand is growing through the electrification of sectors like transportation and home heating. On the supply side, requests for interconnection of distributed energy resources and renewables is putting more stress on the electricity grid. As a wires-only company in four states and a fully integrated company in one state, I can think of no other electric utility that is better positioned to enable the increased demand and facilitate the energy transition than FirstEnergy. Through several strategic transactions, including great execution of a $1.5 billion convertible senior note transaction in the second quarter, the board and the management team have strengthened the balance sheet to invest in our regulated businesses in our service territories. This will lead to better customer reliability, system resiliency, and higher growth for the company. In the time before I arrived, the new board and management had done a commendable job of taking responsibility for and putting the activities of the past few years in the rear-view mirror. On July 20, the company filed the second of three planned updates to the Department of Justice on the company's deferred prosecution agreement. It was a very positive report detailing the progress the company has made on people, processes, and training to preclude such activities from happening again. We continue to cooperate with the department on any and all requests they make to us. During the quarter, the company received a subpoena from the Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission related to matters already detailed in the deferred prosecution agreement. We have cooperated with the commission and will continue to do so. Over the past 60 days, I have had the opportunity to meet with key company stakeholders. I have listened and learned a lot about where the company is in its evolution and some of the key elements required for future success. I've had many town hall, in-person, and virtual meetings with employees in union leadership. We've estimated that I've been able to reach about half of our 12,000 employees so far. This is a very engaged and dedicated workforce. Employees are asking for resources to better serve our customers. I have committed to them that we will invest in our system and them by making sure that we have the right complement of employees with the right training and the right equipment to serve our customers. These employees were not distracted by the events of the past few years and remain focused on safety and our customers. They will lead us into the future with their hard work, skill, and determination. Their commitment was on display again this weekend as our employees worked to restore power to customers impacted by the recent storms. I've had the opportunity to meet with three of our five commissions and two of our state governors. In talking with them, I committed that the company will take responsibility for the actions of the past when those dockets come before them. I also expressed our desire to engage constructively in normal course of business with the commissions for the benefit of our customers. Each of the commissions I spoke with want FirstEnergy to keep up with the normal day-to-day business of investing in our utilities and serving our customers. I have not detected any regulatory overhang associated with the past that would impact our forward-facing activities before the commissions. This is really important because we have a full regulatory schedule that John will take you through in detail. Camilla Serna and his regulatory team are engaged in base rate cases in Maryland, New Jersey, and West Virginia that represent about $7 billion in rate base with returns that need to be updated. We have important ESP-5 and grid mod 2 filings in Ohio and the consolidation case in Pennsylvania. We anticipate base rate filings in Ohio and Pennsylvania next year with current combined rate bases of about $10.5 billion with returns that also need to be updated. We spent a lot of time together as a management team and with the board discussing how to best organize the company to reach our goals quickly and sustainably. There are key roles that need to be filled. In July, we added two key hires, Abigail Phillips as chief risk officer and Amanda Merton's Campbell, our vice president of external affairs. These are experienced professionals who have hit the ground running and are already making an impact. We are currently looking to fill our chief operating officer role. We have attracted well-known industry leading candidates and hope to be able to make announcements in the near future. Over the past two years, FirstEnergy has consolidated key functions like engineering, HR, workforce development, and others. These actions led to efficiencies and consistency in standards. At the same time, there is a sense that certain decision-making would be better if it were closer to the customer and to the employees providing the service. We are looking at ways to make that happen and we'll be updating you on this in the months to come. I've spent considerable amount of time with investors talking about our plans for organic investment and growth. These discussions have focused on the investment needed in our electric grid, management additions we plan to make, and the regulatory schedule necessary to convert investment into growth. I've had the opportunity to meet with three of the major rating agencies. I've committed to further optimizing our financing plan and improving our credit metrics and balance sheet. This included paying down short-term borrowings and repurchasing high coupon debt in the open market with the proceeds of the convertible bond offering from earlier in the quarter. We anticipate FFO to debt being in the 14%-15% range by 2025. Following meetings with these and other stakeholders, I have not found any surprises relative to what I knew coming into the company. What I have found are some key indicators for success. A skilled, engaged, and dedicated workforce. A constructive regulatory environment focused on customer affordability and reliability. A system in need of investment for reliability, resiliency, and to support the energy transition. And finally, a strengthened balance sheet to be able to make that investment and to support organic growth. I believe in this company's strategy of making necessary investments to improve reliability, resiliency, and the customer experience. In addition to reaffirming the company's guidance for 2023, I am reaffirming our 6%-8% long-term growth rate off of the original midpoint of prior year's guidance. We have a strong platform to build upon. We are getting and will continue to get the right people in place to lead this company to sustainable growth. I am incredibly excited about this company and am thrilled to be here at the start of what I know will be a very bright future. With that, I will turn it over to John for more financial detail. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the extremely mild temperatures across our service territory in the second quarter, our focus on efficient operations in a financial discipline allowed us to deliver operating results above the midpoint of our guidance. I'll start today with a review of our financial performance and outlook, then provide an update on recent regulatory activity. As Brian mentioned, second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.41 a share and operating earnings were $0.47 a share. This compares to 2022 second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.33 a share and operating earnings of $0.53 a share. Second quarter results in our distribution business benefited from our ongoing capital investment programs and our laser focus on operating expenses. Together, these helped offset the impact of lower distribution sales, which largely resulted from mild temperatures as well as a lower pension credit. Mild temperatures with cooling degree days 48% below the second quarter of 2022 impacted residential demand by more than 8% and total customer demand by 4% with a year-over-year impact of $0.06 a share. Total residential sales decreased 11% from the second quarter of 2022 or 2% on a weather adjusted basis. On a trailing 12 month basis, weather adjusted residential sales continued to trend about 4% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels and for the June year-to-date period, they are 2% higher than last year. In the commercial sector, lower weather related demand drove a 6% decreased compared to the second quarter of 2022 while demand was down 3% on a weather adjusted basis. Usage by commercial customers over the trailing 12 month period continues to trend below 2019 levels by nearly 5% on a weather adjusted basis. Finally sales to industrial customers increased by just over 1% compared to the second quarter of 2022 and continue recovering towards pre-pandemic levels. As a reminder, revenue from our C&I customer classes are not as sensitive to sales volumes as a result of rate design for these classes, which is typically based off peak usage. In our transmission business, our results benefited from our energizing the future investment program and associated rate-based growth of more than 8% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Favorable weather and accelerated material deliveries allowed us to deploy nearly $400 million of capital into our transmission investment program during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date investments to nearly $750 million, which is over 20% ahead of our internal plan and $260 million or more than 50% ahead of last year. Looking at our corporate segment, second quarter results benefited primarily from lower operating expenses and lower interest costs, which helped to offset a lower earnings contribution from Signal Peak. We are very pleased with how we responded to the challenges we face this year, especially the impact of the extremely mild temperatures on distribution sales, which on a year-to-date basis is $0.18 per share below last year and $0.16 per share off plan. The team's effort allows us to confirm our guidance range this year of $2.44 to $2.64 a year. First, our focus on our cost structure, particularly our operating expenses, has been second to none. As you can see, our O&M has improved $0.13 a year, year-over-year, and is well ahead of our internal plan. Our focus on managing our labor costs through productivity improvements and selective hiring is paying off. In addition, in May, we announced an involuntary separation program and a voluntary early retirement program impacting approximately 550 employees. And we continue to focus on third-party and other operating costs, including corporate facility costs, branding and sponsorships, and improved customer collection rates, which has helped us lower our bad debt expense. Currently through June, our base O&M is running about 6% below plan and 11% below last year. And the expectation in the second half is for that trend to improve versus last year, given some of the steps we have taken to further reduce costs and the maintenance work we accelerated from '23 into '22. Second, in early May, we completed a very successful sale of $1.5 billion in convertible senior notes with a coupon rate of 4%. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 20% from our closing share price on May 1. We consider this a cost-effective bridge to when we receive the full $3.5 billion from our previously announced agreement to sell a 30% interest in first-energy transmission LLC. The use of proceeds will be EPS accretive as we repaid high-cost short-term borrowings, reduced 738's coupon debt at FE Corp, and made a $750 million contribution to our pension plan, which had required contributions beginning in 2025. As a result, our net qualified pension obligation improved to approximately $800 million at the end of the second quarter, down from $1.7 billion at the end of last year, representing a funded status of 91% at the end of June. In addition, we don't have any minimum funding requirements through 2027. The convertible note issuance supports our ongoing work to optimize our financing plan, improve our credit metrics, and our balance sheet as we target FFO to debt metrics of 14% to 15%. Finally, we do anticipate a lower effective tax rate for the year, closer to 17%, resulting from the expected use of state net operating loss carry-forwards. Again, despite the extremely mild temperatures we've seen this year, the team has worked extremely hard to rise to the challenges so we can deliver on our commitments. Now let's shift gears and talk about our rate proceedings and other regulatory activity in the quarter. I'll start with the three base rate cases we filed earlier this year, these cases, which represent over $7 billion of rate base, and weighted average test year return on equity of less than 6% are progressing well through the regulatory process and consistent with our expectations. In New Jersey, we received a procedural schedule for our proposed revenue increase of $193 million, with evidentiary hearings to be held in early January of next year. In Maryland, very constructive evidentiary hearings were held last month on our proposed $50 million rate case, which was filed in March and supports equity returns of 10.6%. We do expect new rates to go into effect in October of this year. And in West Virginia, our Mon Power and Potomac Edison West Virginia utilities filed a base rate case in May, requesting a $207 million increase in revenue to support reliability investments, grid resiliency, our generation assets, and an enhanced customer experience, while providing assistance to low income customers. Key proposals in the filing include distribution rate base of $3.2 billion, and return on equity of 10.85%. A hearing has been set for January of next year, and new rates are expected to be effective by the end of March. Importantly, even with the proposed rate adjustments in each of these jurisdictions, our customers would continue to have some of the lowest residential rates among their in-state peers. Other regulatory activity also continues to progress. We filed our Ohio Electric Security Plan 5 in early April. As we discussed on our first quarter call, our proposal supports our generation procurement process for non-shopping customers, continued support for investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management riders, and energy efficiency programs. Our filing also includes proposals that support low income customers and electric vehicle incentives. We have requested approval for the new ESP effective June 1 and next year, when the ESP-4 ends, and hearings are scheduled for November of this year. We also received a procedural schedule last month for the Ohio Grid Mod 2 filing we made last summer. Under the schedule hearings are planned for October of this year, and we look forward to advancing the $626 million capital investment plan to continue our work enhancing the delivery of safe, reliable power, offering modern customer experiences, and supporting emerging technologies. And Pennsylvania hearings have been set for next week to consider our application to consolidate our four Pennsylvania distribution utilities. As we stated, this is an important step to align with our state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure, and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy. And we are in settlement discussions with the parties to the case. And in May, FirstEnergy in Brookville submitted applications to FERC and to the Pennsylvania PUC to facilitate the FET minority interest sale that was announced in February. We have received approval for the sale from the Virginia State Corporate Commission, and the transaction also requires successful review by CFIUS. Finally, Mon Power is no longer reviewing the possible purchase of the pleasant power station. Last week, FERC approved the sale of the plant to a subsidiary of Omnia's Fuel Technologies. We will file an update with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when that sale is complete. So, all in all, several regulatory proceedings in flight, but everything is progressing very well and consistent with our plan. The regulatory team and the employees that support the regulatory filings are doing a terrific job, and we couldn't be happier with the progress. As a reminder, you can find summaries of our key filings together with news releases and links to the dockets on the regulatory corner section of the IR website. I'm very proud of our team's performance despite the challenges we have faced this year. We are on track with key regulatory initiatives, and we're executing very well in the areas that we control with strong capital deployment and financial discipline with our operating expenses. Thank you for your time today. Now let's open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start off, I guess, if we're looking to 10-Q a little bit here. Notice this OO CST subpoena, and was wondering if you might be able to provide a bit more detail on what that entails and could that impact the DPA in any way? Brian Tierney : We don't think it will impact the DPA in any way. We, everything in the DPA was laid out. The company accepted responsibility for the activities that happened in the DPA. The OO CIC seems to be asking questions around what was detailed in the DPA and that the company's taken responsibility for. So other than that, we really can't offer any color other than to say that we're cooperating with their subpoenas, and we'll continue to do so. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And just with regards to signal peak, I was just wondering if you could provide any updated thoughts as far as asset earnings profile and I guess, how core that asset is or any other details you could share there? Jon Taylor : Hey, Jeremy, this is John. So, obviously signal peak is not an asset that necessarily fits in with our regulated strategy. So it is something that we look at from time to time to determine if there's a market where we could monetize that asset. It has been tough, but we continue to look at that from time to time. Commodity prices have come down since the beginning of the year, but we factor that into our plan going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And any update thoughts on what percentage of earnings that might look like in the future, given what you described there? Brian Tierney : Yes. I think it will continue to be less than 10% of the earnings of the company going forward. So it's going to come down on a relative basis as well as an absolute basis. And we factor that into the plan going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. One last one if I could. Brian, it seems like you've undertaken a number of new strategic initiatives and some, it seems like some geographic decentralization efforts and overall. Just wondering how significant do you think the synergies could be over time, with some of the strategic measures that you've been, you have undertaken at this point? Brian Tierney : So I think a couple of things, Jeremy. One is I think the consolidation that the company did around certain functions, HR, engineering, workforce development and the like. That's where we get real synergies from. I think we're going to get better decision making, pushing the decision making closer to the customers and employees because an executive running that particular entity will have the best insight into what the commissions want, what the customers want and what the employees need to do their jobs. So I think that decision making can happen much closer to where the activity is happening rather than a lot of that decision making happening here in Akron. I've seen that model work before at various other companies and I think we'll benefit from that going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That makes sense. Very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Mr. Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Thanks. Appreciate it. .Don't get called Mr. that much anymore so. Good morning. Congrats, Brian, on your first call. Brian Tierney : Good morning. Thanks. Steve Fleishman : Thanks. I guess just in your intro you mentioned reaching out and seeing a lot of various constituents including kind of regulators and the like. I'm just, given the history in Ohio, I guess most curious, your perception of any discussions there, regulators, political, employee base, et cetera, any call specifically in Ohio. Brian Tierney : Yes. So I've reached out to the commission there and employees. I've not had a chance to speak with the executives in the state yet but are still trying to get those scheduled. I'll say that the commission there is and always has been very, very professional, engaged, experienced and dedicated to making sure that utilities make the investments that improve reliability and the customer experience in the state. And that Steve really hasn't stopped over the last three years, right? We're concluding grid mod one. We're concluding the ESP-4 right now. So Ohio over time has been very effective in making sure that there are those riders and trackers in place to make the specific investments that the commission wants us to make. And when I met with the commissioners there, they seemed very focused on making sure that we continue to engage in those activities, those processes and those investments going forward. What I have with everyone I met with, there will be a time and a place to deal with the activities of the past and people have documents ready to do that. And I've committed that, like we have in other venues, that the company will take responsibility for that and do the right thing. But there's a real desire to make sure that we focus on the go forward business. And there seems to be no regulatory hangover associated with the past either in Ohio or in West Virginia or New Jersey that I've also visited with. Steve Fleishman : Okay, that's helpful. And then just you talked about kind of updating the ROEs in these cases is that, if you look at your data based on the way you kind of have it out there, it looks like you're underearning pretty much in all these jurisdictions. So are you talking about kind of getting that basically kind of dealing with the underearning situation? Brian Tierney : Yes. So thanks Steve for exposing my coded language there. Yes, that's what we're looking to do, is go to places where we are underearning either due to the fact that we haven't been in for a long time or that we've made significant investment that hasn't been updated and make sure that we get investment reflected in rate base and that we ask for authorized ROEs that are more consistent with what you're seeing across the industry rather than the lower ROEs that we're currently earning. Steve Fleishman : Okay, and then lastly, I think you mentioned meeting with the rating agencies or maybe you or John could just update on any potential credit upgrades? Brian Tierney : Yes, so we've been to see all three of the rating agencies recently. We've been on a watch for a change for Moody's for over 18 months now, have paid special attention there trying to give them what they could need. We hope that they will take action here in the near future in a positive way. As we look at S&P, I think they're looking for final resolution of the DPA, which will happen hopefully in 2024, as well as FFO to debts that are consistently moving above the 12% range. And we hope to be doing both of those here in the near future. Steve Fleishman : Okay, thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Mr. Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. John, I wanted to just really just get a little bit deeper on Signal Peakif it's okay with you and start a needed course here. But the prices have declined another 30% since that Q1 update. Because we're thinking about maybe full prices, any hedging you may have in place and what hedges you are off. I guess how does all this tie in with the linearity of your 6% to 8% growth rate? In other words, as we're thinking about '23, '24, is there enough levers like O&M and liability management to mitigate incremental signal speed pressures as we're thinking about your annual guidance and where is that growth rate? Jon Taylor : Yes. Thanks, Shar. I mean, you're right. The prices have declined somewhat over the course of the last year. I would tell you that in '24 and '25, we kind of had that baked into our plan to begin with. And so on an absolute and relative basis, we had those earnings declining somewhat to what we've seen historically, at least in the last couple of years. And then if you look at just where we're filing cases currently with over $7 billion of break base under review, probably earning at return of 6%, you're really going to see strong regulated growth in the distribution businesses. We will have some O&M increases in '24 relative to '23 primarily because of some timing. But we're also doing a pretty nice job managing that. So at least based on what I see today, we have clear line of sight into fairly linear growth going forward. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. That's an important point. Thank you for that. And then obviously, we're approaching the Ohio case next May, which is, I think, a very key event we're all going to monitor for obvious reasons. Just remind us on the drivers of the case. Is it capitals at rate-based deferred costs? How we should think about, maybe, that are we request in relationship to what you're earned or we are, especially if there's a chance to commission diverts from historical precedence on treatment of goodwill there? So how do we put all this together into that case? And then also, how are you messaging or will message around rate impact? Or would you still think it'll be built in neutral? Thanks. Jon Taylor : Yes. So I would say a couple of things. Rate-based, since the last case, has increased over 50%. Our cost of service has increased primarily because of some of the accounting changes associated with our vegetation management program, the A&G cost that we previously capitalized. So we're projecting a return, an earned return when we file those cases somewhere in the 7% to 7.5% next year versus, an allowed return in terms of what we're seeing in the state, nine and a half, 10%. The capital structure we think will probably be closer to 50 :50. Right now, if you look at the actual capital structure, it's probably closer to 55% equity, but we think it'll be more in line with what we have today, which is 49% equity. So, I mean, those are the key attributes of the case. We'll continue to refine those and give you a more fulsome update when we file in May of next year. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Jon for that. It's super helpful. And, Brian, congrats on your first earnings call. See you guys. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Shar. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Mr. Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. And congrats, Brian, again. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Julien. Good morning. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Just following up on a couple of items. Maybe, John, just starting with what you were talking about the second ago, the increase in O&M that you were talking about going into next year. Talk about how much of an offset you could be getting from the separations and headcount here. I know you put some comments in the queue here on that front. And then related, obviously, you're adding some headcounts here at the C-suite elsewhere. So just put some takes on that O&M increase. You talked about timing issues, but just delving into that a little bit more. Brian Tierney : Yes, great question, Julien. Let me give you a little bit of context as to what we're seeing. So when you think about the original plan that we had going into '23, we had to have plan for about a 12% year-over-year O&M reduction relative to '22, which was right at about a [billion five] of base O&M. Okay. I would tell you about half of that was what I would consider timing or one time primarily associated with the work that we accelerated from '23 into '22 to help mitigate the pension. But the other half was sustainable O&M reductions around productivity improvements, around lower branding and advertising costs, some efficiencies that we were getting to transition to more data and analytics to drive more efficiency in our operations. And so that was the original plan. Later on top of that, the impact of the voluntary and involuntary program, we'll continue to see more sustainable savings going forward. And I think what that will result in is about the only thing that you'll really see going into '24 is that one time, which is about $100 million or so of incremental O&M that you'll see into the plan going into 2024, everything else will be sustainable and will be used to offset any type of inflation going forward. So really what we're anticipating, if you look at our current forecast this year versus '22, we've gone from about 12% improvement to about a 15% improvement with about half of that flowing back into next year. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you so much, John, for the detail of that response there. And then if I can, to continue in the spirit of detail, how do you think about asking for higher authorized equity ratios, considering the desire to use the bookfield proceeds, as you've discussed, for equity growth investments, and then also consistent with the idea of higher equity ratios in the current and past rate case bonds you've pursued already here? Brian Tierney : Yes, great question. So I would tell you with the first FET transaction, plus the common equity issuance, we improved the capital structures in New Jersey, West Virginia, and Maryland by probably anywhere from two to three points. So we were probably 49, 45% and now we're close to 50, if not above 50% in those jurisdictions where we have rate proceedings ongoing. If you think about the next FET transaction, which will close next year, a lot of about half of that, those proceeds have been deployed already through the convertible note offering. So we put that money to the pension, we took out some holding company debt, and then we reduced short-term borrowings. With the other 50%, we'll look to improve the capital structures primarily in Pennsylvania, which right now are about 49%, and we'll look to improve that to, close to 53% as we gear up to file that case next year. Julien Dumolin-Smith: Got it. Okay, excellent. 53%, wonderful. Really appreciate that, and best of luck, guys. Again, congrats, Brian. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I appreciate the message. It's been decades. Thank you. So first on Moody's, have you spoken to the agency since you received the new subpoena? And I'm just wondering if that has a chance of, anyway derailing the upgrade that we've been waiting for? Brian Tierney : Yes, so we have spoken with them as you'd expect when we respond to a subpoena. And the dialogue seems to be around the things that were associated with the DPA that we've already settled with the Department of Justice and taken responsibility for. So other than that, we're not aware of anything else and certainly don't expect any derailment of anything. Angie Storozynski : Okay, and there's no news on the FCC investigation or any sort of settlements or any quantification of the potential downside here? Brian Tierney : No, they, the initial subpoena came to us in September of 2020, and then each year since they've updated their request for information. And that seems to be what's happened here at the end of May. And no, we can't quantify what any fine might be there, but expect that there will be one. Ultimately -- Angie Storozynski : Okay, and then moving on to the equity layer in Ohio. And I know we've talked about it before. The Goodwill, substantial Goodwill and how you calculate your equity layer. I mean, is there any concern as you go into this distribution rate case about, how the commission is going to calculate the equity layer in Ohio? Brian Tierney : So I would just say a couple of things. We have the writers today, DCR and the AMI writer, which deals with the grid mod work. All of those are based on the capital structure that we have for base rates or our actual capital structure. We have precedent in the state of Ohio through the seat proceedings as well as through other cases in the state that they don't remove Goodwill in those types of calculations. So we don't necessarily see it as a concern. But it'll be something that we'll work through over the course of the case. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And lastly, just looking at the performance of your pension funds and I'm just wondering. So I'm assuming that the opposite is going to be true, meaning that there will be a potential gain that will support your 24 earnings. And so if there is any O&M inflation, it will be more than offset by that potential gain and any efficiencies on the O&M side that you talked about earlier, is that right? Brian Tierney : Well, I would just tell you through June. The asset performance was close to 8% versus an expected return for the full year of 8%. The discount rate has come down slightly since year end. But we don't have in the plan, growth from the pension in \u201824 and \u201825 other than from the contribution that we made, which will be for the full year in \u201824 versus a partial year for '23. So, based on our plan, we're going to continue to drive, O&M efficiencies through our FE Forward program as well as other continuous improvement initiatives. And we're not relying on the pension to drive growth for the company. Angie Storozynski : Good. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Sophie. Sophie Karp : I just wanted to follow up on Ohio. And did you provide a little more color on how, if there's any ROE discrepancy between different utilities in Ohio, between the three utilities you have there, is 7.3 the average of the three? And if there are discrepancies, can you provide a little more color on what the range is? Brian Tierney : You were cutting out, Sophie. I think your question was, we provided an ROE of 7.3% on a consolidated basis. Is there any disparity between that amongst the three utilities in the state? Sophie Karp : Yes. Yes. Brian Tierney : I don't have that information here readily available. But I would imagine there would be some disparity between the three companies. I think it would be significant, significantly different from the 7.3% . But we would typically file in the state all three companies at the same time. And so that's why we provided at the state level. Sophie Karp : Yes. But when you file, do you think that there will be, I guess, a pathway for you to consolidate these utilities in this rate case? Or are they too far apart in terms of the economics to attempt that? Brian Tierney : Yes. So I guess there's two steps to that, right? First, like we're doing in Pennsylvania, it's a legal entity consolidation. We're still going to have four separate rate books in Pennsylvania, and we'll merge those probably over a period of two to three rate cases. And we'll do the same thing in Pennsylvania. So, excuse me, Ohio. We'll make the filing to do the consolidation on a legal entity basis, but we'll still have, three separate rate books, and we'll merge those over time. Sophie Karp : Got it. Okay. And just lastly, a little bit of a housekeeping question. Could you just reiterate what's the level of FFO to that that you had at the end of the quarter? And what would that be, if performer for the Brookfield Transaction Closing? Brian Tierney : Well, the performer for the Brookfield Transaction closing, when we deploy all the proceeds, would support the 14% to 15% that we're targeting. If you look at on a trailing 12 month basis, I'm assuming it's probably close to 10.5%. We were at 10.5% at the end of last year. So as we start to receive the proceeds in next year, deploy those proceeds, you'll see a pretty significant improvement. We'll also have rate relief in New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland that will help the metrics going into next year. But right now I would anticipate the plan with the pension contribution for the full year of \u201822 being close to 11% FFO to debt for this year. Sophie Karp : Excellent. Thank you so much. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Sophie. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill : Yes, thank you. Maybe a follow-up on the O&M, and just how you're thinking about that, longer term throughout the plan, what levels can you achieve, what areas can you look at to drive out those cuts or efficiencies? Thanks. Jon Taylor : Yes. So like I mentioned earlier, I mean, you will see a little bit of an increase next year, just mainly because of the work that we accelerated from '23 into '22, as well as some other timing items. But I think, as Brian and I have talked about the plan going forward, continuous improvement initiatives are going to be very important to the plan. And so that'll be something that we continue to stay focused on. Now, whether that, is less than inflation or do we want to drive out, all the inflation and keep O&M flat, I mean, I think that'll depend on the facts and circumstances within the plan and where we are. But we don't anticipate significant O&M growth, once we get past 2024. Brian Tierney : Greg, we've talked about this internally, right? I've seen utilities that are the premier utilities in the industry have continuous improvement as part of their culture. And we've had a program in FE Forward, which this year is beginning to pay significant dividends as employees are embracing the tools that we've given them to be able to do that. We're going to make that not a program, but part of our culture and DNA going forward, that we're not going to brand as FE Forward. We're just going to call it continuous improvement. And our goal will be to flatten or even decrease that O&M curve over time as part of an overall program that is continuous improvement, not just O&M savings. Gregg Orrill : Okay, thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : Very good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : So just on the subpoena, the timing, this seems a little odd to me. From meeting the 10-Q, it seems to me that you guys weren't aware of this investigation. And if the subpoena shows up, I guess, so late in the day, it seems. Any thoughts about that? Jon Taylor : So, yes, other people might agree with your comment on the timing. With the law, the OOCIC's investigations need to be kept confidential. So it's not a surprise to us that our first knowledge of it was the subpoena. But given the fact that it seems to be dealing with activities that have been dealt with, resolved, responsibility taken for and paid for in the DPA, we just would have to leave it up to the OOCIC what their interests in these matters are. Paul Patterson : Okay. I mean, do you have any discussions where they're explaining it, or you can relate to us about what might be going on, I guess, with respect to them? Is that right? Jon Taylor : Yes, just nothing other than us facilitating transfer of information that they're requesting, which is all related to the DPA activities. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then with respect to your discussions with regulators around your service territories, I noticed that you guys have been involved, or at least proposing, it seems to me, increased funding for low-income, affordability-challenged ratepayers, if I'm correct. I was just wondering, how is the regulatory reaction to that? Do they see that as going in a long way to sort of addressing the issue of rate concerns? Brian Tierney : Yes, I'll just say we're trying to engage with our commissions constructively on that issue. All of them, as you might suppose, are very focused, given economic issues, given inflationary pressures on our customers. All of them are focused on affordability for our customers. And we're trying to put our dollars to work to address those concerns as well. And I think we're just trying to be constructive with our customers and commissions as we work through other rate matters that we have before them. Paul Patterson : Absolutely. And no, I understand that. I guess maybe I'm not asking it right. I guess what I'm wondering is, when you approach them with that proposal, are they receptive? Or, I mean, maybe too early to say, or what have you. But sometimes the jurisdictions get more concerned about the actual total sort of impact in other jurisdictions. It seems like if you can sort of address the issue of those most at risk, I guess, of adverse issues, that that seems to go a long way. Do you follow what I'm saying? Do we have any flavor on that? Brian Tierney : Yes, I don't know if I'm missing or misunderstanding the questions. All of our commissions view it as being positive and constructive when we try to help in our rate proceedings those who are most challenged to pay their bills. Paul Patterson : Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. Maybe I didn't hear correctly. I apologize. And finally, there's this Chevron doctrine that's being that I guess it's the Supreme Court, and it's kind of a significant issue, it seems like actually just in terms of EPA, FERC, what have you, I don't know what to sort of make of it in terms of what the potential impact might be, and I was wondering, do you guys have any sense about what a substantial change in this sort of long-held, sort of regulatory approach to things might be if the, if the Supreme Court, as some might, are speculating, would be would take, would have a new, completely different take on it. Brian Tierney : Yes, so, Paul, we'll dig into that, but I'll just say that's not been on the top of my list in my first 60 days here. Paul Patterson : Sure. I can imagine that. I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts that you guys have about it, but I can understand there's other stuff going on. Thanks so much. Brian Tierney : Okay. Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. [indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. With respect to the OOCIC, is there anything under the DPA that would prevent the state from taking actions or potential violations of state law covering the same ground that the federal DPA covered? Brian Tierney : Paul, we just feel like we've taken responsibility for the activities that are outlined in the DPA and have paid the fine for that and taken responsibility for it. So I really don't know the answer to your question. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So it's possible that they could just re-litigate the same issues that were essentially resolved and litigated at the federal level. Brian Tierney : Yes, that would be unusual. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's my only question. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Okay. Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Tierney for closing conference. Brian Tierney : Okay. We'd just like to thank everyone for their participation in today's call. We look forward to continuing this dialogue going forward. Appreciate your interest and are pleased with the quarter and look forward to seeing you next time. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today\u2019s session will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Irene and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss third quarter and year-to-date results, some key developments over the last few months and our outlook for the future. For the third quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings of $0.74 per share versus $0.58 last year. Operating earnings for the third quarter were strong at $0.88 per share at the upper end of our guidance range and compared favorably to $0.79 per share last year. Our financial performance was a result of discipline and operating expenses as well as execution of our regulated capital investment plan to improve system resiliency and reliability. Also, as previewed on the second quarter call, we realized a tax benefit in the quarter related to a state tax adjustment, which reduced our effective tax rate to 17% for the year-to-date period. Our service territory continued to experience very mild temperatures impacting earnings by $0.06 per share compared to last year. In addition, quarterly results were impacted by lower pension credit and higher financing costs, primarily as a result of higher debt balances used to fund our capital investment program. Through strong execution by our treasury group, our consolidated long-term borrowing rate remained essentially flat. For the year-to-date period, we reported GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share versus $1.42 per share last year. Operating earnings for the 9-month period were $1.94 per share compared to $1.91 in 2022. As you know, we have faced some headwinds in 2023 from both the impact of market conditions to our pension plan and the impact of the extremely mild temperatures on distribution sales. Our employees have risen to these challenges by focusing on the things within our control, allowing us to meet our financial commitments despite these headwinds. Examples include demonstrating financial discipline. Our employees were able to reduce base O&M by over $130 million or 13% year-over-year by executing on various continuous improvement initiatives. Employees executed on our capital plan with CapEx increasing $410 million year-to-date, mostly in transmission, which is 50% ahead of 2022 levels. Our treasury organization executed on a strategic low cost of capital, convertible debt issuance that was used to retire high cost debt and fund our pension. Jon will discuss these drivers and others in more detail in just a few minutes. The key takeaway is that we have had tremendous operational and financial execution to allow us to meet our targets. We intend to build on this performance, continue to change our culture and improve resiliency and reliability for our customers. We are providing a fourth quarter guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share, which assumes normal weather. We are also narrowing our 2023 operating earnings guidance range to $2.49 per share to $2.59 per share from our original range of $2.44 per share to $2.64. In addition, we are reaffirming our 6% to 8% targeted long-term growth rate off of the original midpoint of prior year\u2019s guidance. Before I move to key developments in the quarter, I want to address a couple of other topics. First, I want to briefly address the Ohio Organized Crime Investigation Commission, subpoena. We have no new material update at this time, and we continue to cooperate with the commission and address their questions. Their focus continues to be on activities that were detailed in the deferred prosecution agreement with nothing new. FirstEnergy has taken full responsibility for those activities and implemented corrective actions to ensure that those type of activities never happen again. We will continue to cooperate with the OOCIC as we focus on executing our strategy and fulfilling our vision to transform FirstEnergy into a top-performing utility. The last subject before we move on is that I believe we are uniquely well positioned for the current interest rate environment. We expect to close on the FET transaction early next year and to receive the full proceeds of $3.5 billion in 2024 with the majority funded at close. In addition, our debt maturities are light over the next couple of years, on average, approximating 6% of our total debt outstanding. This positioning supports our robust capital plan. This year, we are on track for $3.7 billion in capital investments, up from our original plan of $3.4 billion. In 2024 and 2025, our planned capital investments are $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. This brings our total capital investments over the 3-year period to approximately $12 billion. This capital investment plan is comprised of 47% transmission and 51% distribution, supporting 7% rate base growth over the period and we\u2019re reviewing additional investments to serve our customers. Turning to Slide 6. Let\u2019s review some recent key developments. In September, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share payable December 1. This represents a 5% increase compared to the quarterly payments of $0.39 per share paid since March of 2020. The increase corresponds with our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70% that was approved by the Board earlier this year. It sets the stage for future dividend growth that is aligned with our long-term operating earnings growth as we continue to work \u2013 as we continue working to enhance value for investors. During the quarter, we also achieved some important regulatory milestones that support our strategy of investing to improve reliability, resiliency and the customer experience. On October 18, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved our distribution base rate case including a $28 million revenue increase that supports equity returns of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 53%. We are pleased with this outcome, which support continued investments in the state and helps us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable and affordable electricity to our customers in Potomac Edison\u2019s Maryland service territory. We are also excited to move forward with the first of our 3 utility-scale solar generation sites in West Virginia, totaling 30 megawatts of capacity. Our proposal, along with the small construction surcharge was approved by the West Virginia Public Service Commission in August. We plan to seek approval from the PSC to build an additional 2 solar sites, representing another 20 megawatts once customer subscriptions reach the 85% threshold. Jon will address the regulatory items and discuss the progress we\u2019re making with other filings, including the Pennsylvania consolidation case and our rate proceedings in New Jersey, Ohio and West Virginia. We are focused on making the necessary investments in our regulated businesses, our employees and in systems and our systems to enhance the customer experience and create new opportunities from the energy transition. To execute that vision, we are shifting decision-making and accountability closer to where the work is being done to serve customers. We are making progress to fill several key executive positions in an organization that will be structured to allow greater execution at the business unit level. In the near future, we expect to announce a President, FirstEnergy Utilities, as well as a Chief Operating Officer. President, FirstEnergy Utilities, will oversee 5 business unit executives who will lead our state operations and our stand-alone transmission companies. In our new organization, the business unit executives will have P&L responsibility and will be accountable for regulatory direction and outcomes as well as operational performance. The Chief Operating Officer, will lead the customer experience group and a range of T&D functions, including planning, construction, system operations, safety and compliance. Five months into my role, I\u2019m more excited than ever about the future of FirstEnergy. We are building a strong foundation of operational and financial excellence. We are using our strengthened balance sheet to invest in our people and our system for reliability, resiliency and in support of the energy transition. We are poised to capitalize on these opportunities to continue to grow the company and create a strong investment opportunity for investors. Thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Conference next month and talking more about the progress we\u2019re making at FirstEnergy. Now I will turn the call over to Jon for more financial detail. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, which showcased our commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline. This work enabled us to offset the impact of continued unseasonably mild temperatures across our service territory and deliver operating results near the top-end of our guidance. In addition, we\u2019re also making good progress on our regulatory initiatives, which I\u2019ll review in more detail in a few minutes. Let\u2019s start with a review of our financial performance. As Brian mentioned earlier, third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.74 a share and operating earnings were $0.88 a share. This compares to 2022 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 a share and operating earnings of $0.79 a share. And on a year-to-date basis, operating earnings are $1.94 a share compared to $1.91 a share in 2022 despite significant headwinds from our pension plan and lower weather-related distribution sales. Our performance in large part is due to intense focus on our operating expenses. Lower company-wide O&M improved operating results by $0.08 a share in the third quarter and $0.21 a share on a year-to-date basis, representing a 13% reduction when compared to the first 9 months of 2022. And our expectation for the full year is an O&M reduction of roughly 15% versus 2022 levels. About 50% of that is unique in nature, including spending we accelerated in 2022, with the other 50% being sustainable cost reductions that we will build upon in 2024 and beyond, primarily related to improved productivity across the entire organization, reduced use of contractors and lower spending on branding and advertising, just to name a few. We\u2019re also running ahead of plan with capital spending in both our transmission and distribution businesses. Strong planning and execution across our operations and supply chain teams as well as the need to respond to more severe and capital-intensive storm events, resulted in an increase to our 2023 forecasted capital investment of nearly $300 million to $3.7 billion from our original plan of $3.4 billion. Looking now at the drivers for each of our business units for the third quarter. Results in our distribution business benefited from the diligent focus on operating expenses as well as our formula rate capital investment programs and rate structures. Together, these helped to offset the impact of a lower pension credit, higher financing costs, mostly associated with new debt issuances and the impact of mild weather on distribution sales. Mild summer temperatures with cooling degree days 17% lower than the third quarter of 2022 and 6% below normal drove a 3% decrease in total customer demand and impacted earnings by $0.06 a share compared to last year. Sales to residential customers decreased nearly 4% compared to the third quarter of 2022 resulting from a 6% decrease due to the mild summer weather, partially offset by a 2% increase on a weather-adjusted basis. Year-to-date, weather-adjusted usage in this customer class is about 2% higher than our forecast and last year, and about 5% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. In the commercial sector, demand decreased just over 1%, resulting from a 2% decline in the mild temperatures but increased over 1% quarter-over-quarter on a weather-adjusted basis. Year-to-date weather-adjusted usage is flat to last year and continues to lag pre-pandemic levels by about 5%. Finally, sales to industrial customers were flat compared to the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2022 and remain slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels. Looking at our transmission business, third quarter results increased as a result of rate base growth of 8% associated with our energizing the future investment program. So far this year, we deployed $1.2 billion of capital in our transmission business, an increase of $400 million or 50% versus last year and nearly $200 million or approximately 20% above our plan. Highlighting just a few of the many projects currently underway, in Northeast Pennsylvania, we\u2019re rebuilding 20-mile 115 kV transmission line to enhance service reliability and improve system resiliency. In Ohio, we\u2019re rebuilding a 20-mile section of a 138 kV power line in Belmont and Harrison Counties which is in the third phase of a larger 64-mile project to enhance service reliability, improve system resiliency and accommodate increasing customer demand. And in West Virginia, we\u2019re upgrading 4 miles of a high-voltage transmission power line in Preston County to reinforce local transmission system against severe weather, meet future energy demands of the region and enhance service reliability for 5,000 customers in the Kingwood area. For the full year, we now anticipate transmission formula rate investments of over $1.8 billion versus our original plan of just under $1.7 billion. In our corporate segment, our results for the third quarter largely reflect the tax benefit from the expected use of state net operating loss carry-forwards, which we discussed on the second quarter call that reduced our consolidated effective tax rate for the year. As Brian mentioned, throughout 2023, our consistent operational and financial execution, including growth from our investment plan, significant cost control and other financing and tax benefits has more than offset the headwinds from pension and the impact of lower weather-related distribution sales which for the first 9 months of this year impacted results by $0.18 per share versus normal. I\u2019m proud of how all of our employees have addressed these challenges and supported our commitments. While 2023 is not over, our 2023 debt financing plan is now complete, with 6 long-term debt transactions at our regulated operating companies totaling $1.6 billion, with an average coupon of 5.41%, slightly below our plan of 5.5%. Also earlier this year, FE Corp. issued $1.5 billion of convertible debt with a coupon of 4% that allowed the company to refinance revolver borrowings costing more than 7% and to make a voluntary pension contribution to eliminate minimum funding requirements in 2025. Additionally, earlier this month, we extended the maturity date on our $4.5 billion revolving credit facilities to October 2027 and added 2 new revolving credit facilities, including a $1 billion facility at FET LLC and $150 million facility at CatCo. Moving forward, we will have $5.65 billion of credit facilities to support our increasing capital programs. As we look to 2024 and 2025, our debt financing plan is minimal since the majority of the FET asset sale proceeds will be received at closing, with the remainder anticipated before the end of 2024. We plan to use these proceeds to repay costly revolver borrowings and depending on the interest rate environment will be used to redeem high coupon holdco debt, such as the 738 notes of which $460 million remain outstanding, retire maturing utility debt and/or defer other utility debt issuances. The funding from the FET transaction, our light debt maturity schedule plus the decision we made to issue the low-cost convertible debt provides significant flexibility with our utility debt financing plan, which other than refinancings and new money requirements at our stand-alone transmission companies could be as low as $2.1 billion over the next 2 years. And as for FE Corp\u2019s holdco debt, we only have $300 million that matures in 2025. All that said, we\u2019re uniquely well positioned for the current interest rate environment with minimal earnings sensitivity to interest rate increases over the next couple of years. Now let\u2019s turn to an update on our rate proceedings and other regulatory activity. As we\u2019ve discussed, we filed three base rate cases earlier this year, representing more than $7 billion of rate base. As Brian said, last week, we received an order in the Maryland base rate case that aligns with our goals to continue meeting the energy demands of Potomac Edison\u2019s rapidly growing population. The order authorized an equity capitalization ratio of 53% with an equity return of 9.5%, recovery of regulatory assets associated with both COVID and electric vehicle infrastructure, while also providing support to help our strategy of strong reliability and resiliency in support of the energy transition. The new rates went into effect October 19. We\u2019re also happy with the progress on the New Jersey and West Virginia base rate cases. In New Jersey, we\u2019ve entered into settlement discussions on our proposed revenue increase of $192 million, and in West Virginia, our hearing is set for late January and our $207 million base rate case with new rates expected to be effective in March of next year. Other recent regulatory updates include in Pennsylvania, FERC approved our application to consolidate our four Pennsylvania distribution utilities in August, and the parties to the case filed a settlement agreement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on August 30. The settlement includes $650,000 in bill assistance for income-eligible customers over 5 years, supports unification of rates over time and includes a tracking mechanism to share certain cost savings associated with the legal entity consolidation with customers. With the ALJ\u2019s recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending final regulatory approval, we expect the consolidation to close by early 2024. This consolidation aligns with our state operating model is an important step to simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy. In Ohio, hearings for our Grid Mod II filing are scheduled to begin in December. This 4-year $626 million capital investment plan will support our continued work delivering safe, reliable power, offering modern customer experiences and supporting emerging technologies. And in November, hearings are scheduled to begin on our fifth Ohio electric security plan which supports our generation procurement process for non-shopping customers as well as investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management riders and energy efficiency programs. Our proposal also supports low-income customers and electric vehicle incentives. We have requested approval for the new ESP effective June 1 of next year. In West Virginia, we reached a unanimous settlement in our depreciation case, with an agreed-upon $33 million increase in depreciation rates, those rates will be effective upon conclusion of the West Virginia base rate case. And as Brian discussed, we received approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission in August to move forward with construction of the first three utility-scale solar generation sites in the state. We expect the first site to be in service by the end of this year and all five sites to be completed before the end of 2025. And at a total investment cost of approximately $110 million. Just as a reminder, summaries of our key filings together with news releases and links to dockets are all available on the regulatory corner section of our Investor Relations website. Looking ahead, we plan to file our New Jersey infrastructure investment program in the next few weeks. And as you know, we are preparing for an active regulatory calendar in 2024. The performance of our team has been second to none by focusing on what we can control and a commitment to continuous improvement. We\u2019ve delivered outstanding operational and financial performance. We\u2019ve overcome the impact of historic unseasonable weather and other challenges to deliver solid results through the first 9 months of this year. We\u2019re on track to meet our financial commitments, and we\u2019re building a strong foundation for continued growth. Thank you for your time today. Now let\u2019s open the call to your questions. Brian Tierney : Hey, Jon, real quick, before we go to Q&A, I\u2019d like to share some late-breaking news from last night. Yesterday evening, PJM released the results of its open window process to address reliability concerns with data center load growth in the Dominion and APS service territories. Based on our preliminary review of these results, we are on track to gain a substantial portion of the projects. The recommendations still need to move through TAC and the PJM Board, but we anticipate that happening by year-end. While these projects won\u2019t come to fruition until the latter half of the decade, we\u2019re really excited about this opportunity. It builds on our successful bid for the onshore transmission construction that supports New Jersey\u2019s offshore wind project, and it further highlights the significant transmission build-out we anticipate in our footprint to support the energy transition. We look forward to talking more about this opportunity at EEI once we\u2019ve had a chance to fully understand the details. Now let\u2019s move to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, Brian. Let me just on the regulatory side. Obviously, we\u2019re going to be approaching the Ohio case next May. I just \u2013 I guess I want to get a little bit of a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about bill impact given this environment? Could this case still end up being sort of built neutral? And just remind us on what\u2019s sort of the key driver of that case is on the invested capital side, rate base, deferred costs, O&M true-ups? And I guess any sort of experiences from the ESP proceeding that could dictate how you manage the GRC? Thanks. Brian Tierney : Yes. Thank you for the question, Shar. You\u2019re really forward-looking. So we\u2019re still in the midst of the ESP V discussions and the Grid Mod II. So we\u2019re in the throes of that, engaging with staff and interveners and trying to come to successful conclusions there. But as you \u2013 all the things you mentioned are what we\u2019re going to be doing in the base rate case next year, it\u2019s going to be taking things out of the trackers and riders that we have, getting them put into base rates, updating fully our rate base, our prudently incurred costs, storm tree trimming, regular O&M, financing costs, all that getting that in base rates and then moving forward with some healthy trackers that we will have at that point. There is nothing that\u2019s going to be controversial in that case. It\u2019s a traditional rate case, nothing special about it, but all the things that you\u2019d expect a regulated utility to be doing. We found over time that the Ohio Commission has been very supportive of wires investments and we\u2019re poised to continue making those and look forward to investing in the state of Ohio. A couple of things that we\u2019re going to be cognizant of in that case. One is where we\u2019re earning right now relative to what we think a normal authorized return should be. We\u2019re well below 9.5% to 10.5% return on equity, and we need to get that increased, and our rates today are about 14% below our in-state peers. So to be honest with you, Shar, it\u2019s too early for us to know what the bill impact is going to be, but we\u2019re always looking for ways to minimize the bill impact to customers. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And then lastly for me, just on the O&M side and just pension, $0.31 of benefit is sort of very material year-over-year. I guess, how much should we assume with this benefit is tactical. So really short-term in nature versus how much of it is maybe more perpetual, so if we can put a multiple on it and assume that benefit carries into \u201825 and beyond. And then any sense on the pension performance year-to-date? Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Jon Taylor : Hey, Shar, this is John. Thanks for the question. So yes, if you look at our O&M performance year-over-year, about a 15% reduction from what we incurred in 2022 which is about $200 million, a little bit more than that. I would tell you about 50% of that is associated with timing of work that we accelerated from \u201823 into \u201822 and some unique items. But the other 50% is sustainable savings associated with just productivity improvements, getting contractors off the property doing the work ourselves, we had some benefits associated with contract terminations associated with sponsorships and branding relationships that we had and just a real intense focus on just general business items that we spend. So I would say about half of it is kind of unique. I would say the other half of it is sustainable savings that we will build upon as we go into next year. With respect to the pension, the pension performance year-to-date is about flat. So that is something that we have our eye on. A lot of that is associated with the interest rate environment, but we\u2019re taking that into account as we think about the long-term. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. I appreciate it guys. That\u2019s all I had and Brian good luck with the search for the COO and President. Appreciate it. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to touch base, I guess, on the financing plans a bit here. Given your CapEx refresh, could you clarify, I guess, what\u2019s in the financing needs at this point? It looks like \u2013 there was prior language last quarter about no equity needs except for $100 million SIP DRIP and didn\u2019t see that messaging in this deck. And just wondering if anything has changed there, what we should expect on that front? Jon Taylor : Yes. That\u2019s still the case. I mean, Jeremy, if you think about where we are relative to our cash flow metrics and our projections, if you think about 14% to 15% FFO to debt. You think about $3.5 billion of proceeds coming in next year from the FET sale, that has significant impact on our financing plan in a meaningful way. And so we have a lot of financial flexibility in the plan. And so \u2013 no new equity requirements fully supports the CapEx plans that we have in place plus the ability to do some balance sheet improvement initiatives to take out additional holding company debt. So no issues there. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful there. And then continuing along on the CapEx front, I just want to kind of run through some of the numbers by had it straight here, but looking at the \u201823 through \u201825 plan, the $12 billion, how that compares to the $18 billion in the \u201821 through \u201825 plan. I think you might have spent $2.4 billion in \u201821, $2.75 billion in \u201822. And it looks like your prior plan might imply $12.8 billion CapEx for \u201823 to \u201825 and so current plan $800 million less. I just wanted to know if I had those numbers right or if there were other moving pieces here, should we be thinking about or CapEx was decreased to any of the different subs? Jon Taylor : CapEx hasn\u2019t been decreased. I mean if you look at what we\u2019re going to spend this year, it\u2019s $3.7 billion and then in \u201824 and \u201825 million, it\u2019s going to be $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. So no change in the \u201824 and \u201825 capital plans from what we introduced back in February of this year. And in fact, we increased the capital plan in \u201823 by $300 million. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful there. Thanks. Just last one, if I could. I think you talked about incremental business disclosures that could be coming forward here. Just wondering if you might be able to offer any incremental thoughts with regards to what type of information we could see there? Jon Taylor : Yes. So I think what we\u2019re going to plan on doing is looking at our segment reporting for 2024 and going forward and making it a little simpler and more transparent for the Street. And quite frankly, for us, it will reflect how we\u2019re going to manage the business going forward. So we\u2019re probably going to move to segments that is distribution, one, transmission another and integrated another, and that will allow us to not have to split companies between the segments and it will require us to not have to do reconciliations for analysts that cover us, investors that are interested in it just makes the presentation of our results simpler and more in line with how we manage the business. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Jon Taylor : Perfect. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning, everyone. Happy Friday. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess thanks for previewing the PJM transmission opportunity. As we kind of think about rolling that into our models, is this opportunity in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And I think you said back half of the plan? Or any idea how to size it at this point? Brian Tierney : We\u2019re still working through that, Nick. We just got the news last night. We do believe it will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars range. Which side of $500 million. We\u2019re still trying to figure out today. But really, it\u2019s late-breaking news for us. We have our engineers working on it today. We hope to be able to provide more detail on that at EEI. Nick Campanella : Great. And then, I guess, just the cadence of updates from here because I know that there is a lot of moving pieces with the COO search to your point, some of the resegmenting and everything, should we still expect fiscal \u201824 guidance on the fourth quarter? And then how do you think about financing CapEx, etcetera? Brian Tierney : Yes. We will provide that guidance on the fourth quarter call. And look, there is going to be some late-breaking news. I\u2019m trying to forecast what it is that we\u2019re going to be \u2013 what the news is going to be, so nobody is surprised. And of course, we\u2019re going to be updating you as that news comes in and becomes available. But I don\u2019t want people to be surprised by the positions that we\u2019re looking for, how we\u2019re going to manage the company going forward, how we\u2019re going to report going forward. And that\u2019s really why we\u2019re forecasting all that. And then we will update it as the news becomes reality. But we anticipate doing all that here over the next several months. Nick Campanella : Okay, thanks. And if I could just squeeze one more in. Just I know that we will get 2024 guidance in the fourth quarter, but there were just some more one-time items in the fiscal \u201823 walk, I acknowledge you kind of brought up the pension headwinds in prepared remarks. How do you kind of think about the offset to those future headwinds like pension, the tax item, etcetera? I know we get a better comp on weather next year, but any guidance you could give would be helpful. Jon Taylor : So, Nick, this is Jon. So, I guess the way I am thinking about this year, if you think about where we are with the pension, if you just look at the year-over-year weather impacts and you look at what the company has done to offset that in terms of rates and investments taking advantage of opportunities in the capital markets with low-cost convertible debt and how we deployed that proceeds. If you just look at the tight cost controls that we have put in place year-over-year, I think that overshadows the benefits associated with the income taxes. And so as you think about next year, and beyond, it\u2019s right, you are right. We are going to get a benefit from going back to normal weather. We have the rate cases that we have in flight. We have the capital programs associated with our distribution companies that are on a formula rate as well as our transmission formula rate CapEx. And so if you think about where the returns are for the three rate cases that we filed this year, and if you look at where the returns are for the cases that we will file next year, I think you can do the math in terms of what\u2019s going to carry the day for the earnings of the company. Nick Campanella : Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks Nick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David Arcaro : Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Brian Tierney : Good morning David. David Arcaro : I was wondering if you could maybe give the latest on the status of the New Jersey rate case. Current thoughts on the settlement potential and maybe specifically on the pension normalization mechanism, how optimistic you are in that coming through? Brian Tierney : So, we are \u2013 as you know, they have stayed the schedule for now to the last settlement discussions to continue. And we are working all of those things that you just mentioned are still in play, and we are still working \u2013 engaging with staff, interveners, others to try and bring a successful conclusion to that case and without having to take it through adjudication. David Arcaro : Okay. It sounds good. And then also curious if you could give the latest feedback from rating agencies on prospects going forward to achieve investment-grade ratings at the parent and how the FFO to debt outlook is sitting right now as you are heading into 2024 as well? Jon Taylor : Yes. I think we continue to have dialogue with the rating agencies. Those have been constructive conversations. They have our projections. It clearly shows that we are going to be in that 14% to 15% in \u201824 and \u201825. I will say that we have kind of taken a little bit of a step back this year in terms of our performance in the metrics. And a lot of that is because of the unseasonable weather, the fact that we made a voluntary pension contribution, we have \u2013 we had some one-off items associated with severance associated with the voluntary retirement program. So, if you kind of take those out of the mix, I mean, we are closer to that 11% range. But clearly, with the rate cases that we have in flight, which we risk adjusted in terms of what we are going to get, the fact that we are going to get now 100% of the FET proceeds in 2024, whereas before, it was going to be about 50% next year, 50% in 2025. So, we will have an opportunity to deploy all of that. It clearly shows that we will be in the 14% to 15% range next year. David Arcaro : Okay. Excellent. I appreciate that color. Thanks so much. Brian Tierney : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Just following up on that FFO to debt question, so I am looking at your financials, I mean the FFO looks particularly weak, right, for the first nine months. And I hear the explanation of why that is. But I thought that we are waiting for some improvement, not even to hit that 14% to 15%, but just some improvement in the FFO to debt, to warrant any upgrades? And it doesn\u2019t seem like it will happen this year, is that fair to say that the trailing 12 months doesn\u2019t seem to have any upward momentum for now. Jon Taylor : Yes. Like I have said, I think the trailing 12 months and where we are this year, we have taken a little bit of a step back. Some of that was planned because we wanted to make the voluntary pension contribution. Some of it was associated with non-recurring items such as the severance that I have mentioned, that\u2019s really going to have about a 1-year payback if you think about it. So, that will improve the metrics next year. And you can\u2019t discount the impact of weather and it, what\u2019s that done to cash flow, right, in terms of the lower weather-related sales. So, I understand your question, but we are very confident in the plan. We are very confident in the metrics that we provided to the rating agencies, and we will see where we get to. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And my bigger question here, and I know that this is what we are all sort of the beating is that you obviously have this bullish EPS and now dividend growth plan. It\u2019s pretty much contingent on the outcome of the distribution case in Ohio, and we won\u2019t know that what happens there until probably very late to 2025. So, how do we get comfortable with that validation of your growth profile between now and then? Brian Tierney : Just \u2013 so Angie, I don\u2019t think we are all debating that at all. I just disagree with that. The things that you look for and how we hit our growth rate are how we perform in the rate cases that are before us, and you are going to have signposts to that long before the end of \u201825. We have the Ohio ESP Grid Mod II. We have the New Jersey case, the West Virginia case. And if we are performing well on those, I think you will be able to see \u2013 you will be able to get an indication that we are being successful in prosecuting rate cases, engaging with staff and interveners and come to positive outcomes. So, no need to wait until the end of 2025. Angie Storozynski : And then just lastly on the tax benefit, very big tax benefits. And I understand that you are trying to address the weather impact. I mean lots of headwinds actually this year, but you are also reflecting in the O&M lever. I mean did you expect to have this tax benefit this year, again \u2013 and is it cash related? Jon Taylor : So, at the beginning of the year, we did not anticipate the effective tax rate being at that 17%, 18%. We anticipated it being probably in that 19% to 19.5% range. So, some of the benefit that we achieved this year was not planned, but something that came up midyear and that the team executed on. I would tell you, long-term though, Angie, if you think about our blended effective tax rate, it\u2019s probably going to be 17%, 18% this year. But longer term, it will be a more normal tax rate in that 20% to 21% range. Angie Storozynski : And that\u2019s already reflected in the growth plan? Jon Taylor : Correct. Angie Storozynski : Along with those additional costs that will come with basically those additional managers that you are hiring for the utilities and the COO, right? All of this is reflected in your \u2013 in your EPS growth plan. Brian Tierney : It\u2019s all in there, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me back in here. Just wanted to kind of clarify, I guess the cadence of updates of what we should be expecting for updates on 4Q or for EEI, just wondering when \u201824 \u2013 I guess future color as far as long-term plan revisions might be if that\u2019s the 4Q event, just wanted to kind of clarify some of the prior comments there. Brian Tierney : Yes. We are going to provide an update on the fourth quarter earnings call. So, we will do specific guidance for \u201824 and we will also update the capital plan at that time. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And this could include everything EPS, long-term EPS CAGR as well or just those two items really the focus? Brian Tierney : Yes. We are \u2013 there is going to be no change in the long-term EPS CAGR. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Great. Very helpful. I will leave it there. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks Jeremy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Hey. Good morning. Just hopefully two quick questions on \u2013 one on Slide 25, and I am not trying to run your rate case decisions in the jurisdictions. But when do you kind of think that we could see like normalized earnings coming from the utilities or maybe we are in a different way? Do you guys have a target of what you think you could earn across the OpCos? Brian Tierney : Yes. I think we can be earning in that 9.5 to low-10s range in terms of ROEs. And so if you look at this, that\u2019s a significant component of earnings growth is going back in having these rate cases, updating our rate base, getting ROEs higher, getting current costs reflected in rates and adjusting what you can see is lower than normal earned ROEs on that slide. Anthony Crowdell : I guess you have answered my \u2013 sorry. Brian Tierney : No, it\u2019s the normal stuff that utilities do, Anthony. It\u2019s just the normal work pale that you expect us to do. We invest for the benefit of our customers. We then operate. We then recover and finance. And that\u2019s what we will be doing this part of the presentation is the recover, where we go back in to get our hard work reflected in current rates. Anthony Crowdell : Okay. And I think that actually answers my second question. I think earlier in one of the slides, I apologize I forgot the number. You guys give us \u2013 I appreciate the detailed rate base growth of about 7%. And to Jeremy\u2019s question earlier about the long-term growth rate of earnings of 6% to 8%, I guess how \u2013 I was curious if you think there is going to be any lag or spread between the rate base growth and the earnings growth, but it seems that they are aligned because of this improvement in ROE. Am I thinking of that correctly? Brian Tierney : Yes. So, we are getting ahead of this now, right. We have very active rate cases to get what you reflected on Slide 25, up to more normal levels. And as we do that, we will have some growth associated with that. And then going forward, we said rate base growth for \u201824, \u201825 was going to be about 7%, and we are looking to add to that as we go forward. So, a combination of continued investment growth in rate base, active rate cases for the foreseeable future and continuing to invest for the benefit of our customers, all of that will put us in that 6% to 8% long-term growth rate. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I am looking forward to seeing you at EEI. Brian Tierney : Thanks Anthony, we are too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill : Hi Brian. Hi Jon. Just on, Brian, where do you stand in terms of the key management hires that you are looking to do? I know you announced two of them already. Are there more to come there? And then just secondly, how are you thinking about moving beyond the sort of legacy investigations that remain? And do you see concerns with that at this point? Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Gregg. I appreciate that. In terms of the key hires, I am spending and our senior executive team here is spending a significant amount of our time recruiting. I feel some of this we need to do sequentially. I need to get a COO in place, President of FE Utilities in place, and I would like those people to help us recruit then the people who are going to be reporting to the President of FE Utilities. And they will be the five people running our major businesses. So, sort of \u2013 and by the way, we are not waiting to interview a candidate pool for those five people. We are proceeding ahead on that as well. So sequentially, trying to get the COO, President of FE Utilities, then next the people that run our four businesses and get those people seated as quickly as possible. But moving very much forward on that, it\u2019s active. We are trying to get this done as quickly as possible. But at the same time, making sure that we are getting the right people in the place who will bring the right skills to bear for the things that we are trying to do. And we have a very strong candidate pool for all of those positions that we are recruiting for. So, I am confident we will get success. The timing of it is going to be here in the, I would say, in the near-term and hope to be able to make those announcements shortly. In terms of putting the past behind us, A lot of that heavy lifting had been done by the Board and the management team before I got here. There is active engagement with the OOCIC. We are providing our updates for the DPA with the Department of Justice. And then for the remaining litigation that\u2019s out there, we are moving forward with that, trying to settle what we can, but put that pass behind us and strongly focused on the future. And I don\u2019t anticipate any unexpected hiccups there. Gregg Orrill : Okay. Good luck. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks Gregg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning Steve. Steve Fleishman : Good morning. Just the cases in Ohio, the Grid Mod and the ESP filing, can you just talk to the schedule there coming up. And I know some of the other utilities have actually have been able to settle ESPs and the like. Is that possible for you? Brian Tierney : Yes. So, we are in the midst of ESP-5 right now. That case is in flight. We have seen intervener\u2019s testimony. I think staff testimony comes out on Monday. But as you would expect us to do, we are actively engaged in settlement discussions in those cases, trying to positively engage people like the staff and the other interveners and hopeful that we will be able to come to a settlement similar to what the other companies have settled at. I don\u2019t see any reason to think that we won\u2019t be able to do that. Steve Fleishman : And then on the Grid Mod, would that be kind of part of the same thing or separate? Brian Tierney : Same thing, slightly behind where we are in ESP-5. But as soon as we get through the ESP, we will get the Grid Mod and hope to be able to settle that as well. There is nothing, Steve, that\u2019s controversial in these. It\u2019s normal course of business, trying to update the rate base and costs that are reflected in those riders, and then hopefully leave those in place until we get to the May \u201824 rate case and then try to get those cleared out and get them reflected in base rates. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes our call today. A replay of the call will be available on FirstEnergy\u2019s Investor Relations website. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com and we plan to file our Form 10-K next week. Today\u2019s session will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Irene. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. It's hard for me to believe that I've been with the company for eight months already. Time has flown by, as I've gotten to know the fantastic employees of this company who are dedicated to serving our customers every day. Some of you have heard me say previously that I consider myself to be a good teller of great stories. While our employees have given me a great story to tell for 2023 and I'll do my best to tell it well. This morning, I'll provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. I will discuss some regulatory milestones that we recently achieved. We are also unveiling today an exciting capital investment program focused almost entirely on our wires business. Over the next five years, we plan to invest $26 billion in our regulated system to improve reliability and the customer experience. This represents an increase of more than 44% compared to our last five-year plan. We will maintain our vigilance on affordability as our current rates are below our in-state peers. Jon will provide more detail on this later. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FirstEnergy delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.30 per share compared to a loss of $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating earnings for the quarter were $0.62 per share, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and compared to $0.50 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year 2023, the company delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.96 per share and operating earnings of $2.56 per share, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Employees work diligently throughout the year to overcome significant headwinds. The impact of market conditions on our pension plan created an earnings drag of $0.30 per share and unusually mild weather impacted earnings by $0.28 per share. Through our continuous improvement program, employees were able to drive base O&M down over $200 million or 14% versus 2022. Half of those savings are sustainable and this tremendous effort buoyed our full year results by $0.32 per share, allowing us to meet our operating earnings targets. In 2023, the company put $3.7 billion of CapEx to work to improve reliability and the customer experience. This was 16% more than was invested in 2022 and 9% more than budget. 93% of the 2023 CapEx was invested directly into our wires businesses. Our projects and construction organizations were able to take advantage of the improving supply chain environment and the mild weather to put the incremental dollars to work. 2023 was a game-changing year for the company in terms of strengthening its balance sheet to enable future investment and growth and are mostly wires regulated business. In February 2023, the company announced a second transaction with Brookfield to sell 30% of FET for $3.5 billion. With the successful completion of our Pennsylvania consolidation, and the anticipated order approving the filed settlement of the transaction, we are on track to close on this asset sale by the end of March. At that time, we will receive the majority of the proceeds in cash with the balance to be paid before the end of the year. In May, we successfully executed a $1.5 billion convertible debt issuance at a 4% coupon. We used these proceeds to pay down debt and make a $750 million contribution to our pension assets. In late December, we executed a $700 million pension lift-out representing over 8% of our total pension liability and reducing volatility in our pension plan by 10%. Our improved financial condition gave the Board the confidence to raise the targeted dividend payout ratio to 60% to 70% of operating earnings. In September, the Board had the confidence to raise the quarterly dividend for the first time in more than three years. Of course, subject to Board approval, our 2024 plan includes dividend declarations of $1.70 per share versus $1.60 per share in 2023. This represents a 6.25% increase. Going forward, we anticipate growing our dividend with operating earnings growth. The significant improvement in our balance sheet puts FirstEnergy energy in a growth and investment mode. The fact that we do not expect incremental equity to fund our CapEx growth beyond our employee benefit programs differentiates FirstEnergy for many of our peers. We are introducing a $26 billion five-year capital investment program to improve reliability and our customers' experience. We are branding this program, Energize 365 and John will provide more details in his remarks. These investments should enable 9% average annual growth in rate base over the period. We are guiding to $4.3 billion of investment in 2024, an increase of 15% over 2023. Energize 365 represents a significant increase in our investments and rate base with improved earnings quality. We expect to maintain a strong customer affordability position versus our in-state peers. We are reaffirming our 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth rate. FirstEnergy plans to execute on our long-term growth rate year-by-year. This is why we are announcing a 2024 operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 per share to $2.81 per share. The midpoint is 7% above 2023's operating earnings guidance midpoint. Turning to slide 6. Let's take a look at our regulatory calendar. One of the questions investors have asked is, how will we know what FirstEnergy can obtain fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes? The answer that we have given is, to look for milestones in our near-term results. In 2023 and early 2024, we have achieved several milestones demonstrating constructive regulatory outcomes. Let me highlight a few. As we mentioned in our last call, we received a reasonable outcome in our Maryland distribution rate case. The commission there approved a $29 million revenue increase that supports equity returns of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 53%. We are pleased to serve and invest in Maryland to provide reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. In West Virginia, we filed a settlement in our ENEC case with staff of broad intervener support for a recovery of $255 million over three years with a carrying cost after year one. The settlement has no disallowances. In January of this year, we filed a settlement in our base rate case with staff and broaden and leaner support for $105 million rate adjustment based on a 9.8% allowed ROE and 49.6% equity ratio. This settlement reflects the $700 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2014. Of course, we did not get everything we asked for, but the settlement is fair and constructive and it demonstrates West Virginia as an attractive place to invest for our customers. In New Jersey, JCP&L filed a base rate case settlement last Friday, with staff and broad intervener support that reflects an $85 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of 9.6% and a 52% equity ratio. The settlement reflects the $400 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2021. The settlement will have a modest 3.4% increase in the average residential bill and JCP&L's rates will be 26% below our in-state peers. If approved, the settlement will be a fair and reasonable outcome that will incentivize JCP&L to make investments to improve customer reliability. In Pennsylvania, we received an order in December, improving the consolidation of our Pennsylvania operating companies and approving the transfer of West Pan Power's transmission assets to CATCo. Both transactions were executed on January 1 of this year. We are awaiting commission approval of the filed settlement for the bit minority interest sale, which is anticipated soon. We anticipate filing a base rate case in Pennsylvania by April. For investors looking for milestones of FirstEnergy's ability to receive reasonable and constructive regulatory outcomes, these recent examples provide convincing evidence. In Ohio, we are actively working our way through our ESP 5 and Grid Mod 2 cases. We are fully engaged in the regulatory process with staff and interveners and expect constructive outcomes in both cases. We plan to file a base rate case in May. Turning to slide 7. I want to briefly review the new segment reporting that FirstEnergy will adopt in 2024, to reflect how we are managing the company. Individual companies will not be split among the segments, leading to simplicity and transparency in reporting as well as accountability and management. Our Distribution segment will house our Ohio and Pennsylvania pure-play distribution-only companies. Our Pennsylvania consolidation and the transfer of the West Penn Power transmission assets to KATCo make this segment transparent and clean. This segment will represent about $10.9 billion in rate base serve 4.2 million customers, and account for about 45% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. A senior executive will lead each of FE Pennsylvania and Ohio. Our integrated business segment will report on JCP&L, Potomac Edison and Mon Power, our companies with combinations of distribution, transmission and generation. This segment will represent about $8.7 billion in rate base, serve 2 million customers, and account for about 35% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. A senior executive will lead JCP&L and another will leave Mon Power and Potomac Edison. Our last major business segment will be standalone transmission and it will house our pure-play transmission-only companies, consisting of our ownership interest in FET as well as KATCo. This segment will represent about $7.7 billion in consolidated rate base, and account for about 20% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. One executive will be responsible for these businesses. Finally, the Corporate and Other segment will be similar to the current segment with Aetna. It will report holding company interest, legacy investments, former subsidiaries and pension and OPEB. A recast of 2023 into the new segments is available in our fact book and we will provide quarterly and year-to-date reconciliations throughout 2024. Let me provide some key updates on Slide 8. In regard to the Ohio organized crime investigations Commission, there's nothing new to report. We continue to cooperate with the commission and answer any questions they ask. The deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ details FirstEnergy's involvement and there is nothing new with respect to the company. In the updated climate strategy published to our corporate responsibility website yesterday, we are providing an update to our greenhouse gas emissions goals. In 2020, we set a goal of achieving net carbon neutrality by 2050, with an interim goal of reducing our Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. Achieving the 2030 interim goal was predicated on meaningful emissions reductions at our Fort Martin and Harrison power plants in West Virginia, which account for approximately 99% of our greenhouse gas emissions. We've identified several challenges to our ability to meet that interim goal, including resource adequacy concerns in the PJM region and state energy policy initiatives. Given these challenges, we have decided to remove our 2030 interim goal. Through regulatory filings in West Virginia, we have forecast the end of the useful life of Fort Martin in 2035 and for Harrison in 2040. We remain focused on achieving our aspirational goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050. In the fourth quarter of last year, we made two-key additions to our leadership team. In November, we announced our hiring of Toby Thomas, as Chief Operating Officer. Toby joined us from American Electric Power, where he spent more than two decades in various leadership positions, including growing and managing one of the largest wires businesses in the country. He is responsible for system planning and protection, transmission, substation and engineering, project and construction management and system operations. Wade Smith joined the company in December, as the President of FirstEnergy Utilities. He was previously the Chief Operating Officer of Puget Sound Energy. Wade brings more than three decades of experience running large-scale multi-state transmission and distribution companies. The presidents of our five operating businesses will report to him. Ohio, Pennsylvania, JCP&L, our standalone transmission business and Mon Power and Potomac Edison. We are actively reviewing internal and external candidates to run these businesses and expect to make hiring announcements in the coming months. Wade and Toby are key additions to the leadership team that will grow and transform this company into a premier electric utility. In 2023, and continuing into 2024, we have made transformational strides to improve the financial strength of FirstEnergy. We have organized our company with a singular focus on growing our five regulated, mostly wires companies. We are making the investments needed to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our strong balance sheet and organic investment opportunities differentiate FirstEnergy for many of our peers. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm also very proud of our performance in 2023, and I'm excited to turn a new page in our company's history. Today, I'll briefly review our 2023 results, but more importantly, discuss our enhanced five-year plan and 2024 guidance. Our results in 2023 speak to our employees' dedication and tremendous performance, which included strategic and transformational initiatives, while doing the hard work to meet our financial commitments in a very challenging year and emerge as a stronger, more nimble company. Since I've been at the company, I can't recall a more challenging year in terms of the financial headwinds we faced including the most abnormal weather conditions that I can remember, the extremely volatile interest rate environment and a significant impact on our pension plan from the interest rate and equity market performance in 2022. But at the same time, our employees demonstrated their grid and resiliency to overcome these adversities while making strategic advancements to improve our operational and financial performance. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.62 a share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.50 a share. For the year, operating earnings were $2.56 a year, also above the midpoint of our guidance range. This represents 7% growth of 2022's guidance midpoint and compares favorably to operating earnings of $2.41 a share in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year results are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website last night. As we pointed to throughout the year, we largely offset the headwinds I mentioned earlier through a strong focus on reduced operating expenses across each of our business units. The deployment of proceeds from the low-cost convertible debt offering in the spring and certain tax benefits realized in the third quarter. Our focus on operating expenses across the company resulted in a 14% or over $200 million reduction year-over-year, representing a $0.32 per share year-over-year benefit. As we've discussed, about 50% of that represents unique items or work that was accelerated in 2022 from 2023, the other 50%, which largely includes productivity improvements across the company, lower contractor usage, and reduced corporate spending on areas such as branding and advertising are sustainable reductions to our cost structure. Our 2023 results benefited from our formulary investment programs across our transmission and distribution businesses, which resulted in a $0.20 per share improvement year-over-year. As Brian mentioned, we successfully deployed $3.7 billion of capital in 2023, about $300 million or close to 10% above our original capital investment plan for the year. In our transmission business, earnings increased $0.08 a share or close to 10% for the year, primarily from our investment programs, which resulted in rate base growth of 9% compared to 2022. Formula rate investments in our transmission business were $1.8 billion, an increase of 28% compared to 2022 and $100 million or 6% above our original plan due to emergent projects. In our distribution business, earnings declined year-over-year, primarily from the lower weather-related distribution sales and the lower pension credit I spoke of earlier, but also reflect the impact of our formula rate investment programs, new rates that went into effect in Maryland in mid-October, higher weather-adjusted demand, and lower operating costs that I spoke of. Distribution CapEx of $1.9 billion represents an increase of 5% compared to 2022, and exceeded our original plan by $220 million or 13% as part of our planned increases we announced last year. Finally, in our Corporate segment, 2023 results benefited from lower O&M and a consolidated effective tax rate of about 16% versus nearly 21% in 2022, mostly as a result of planned use of state net operating loss carryforwards. And a final point on 2023, as Brian discussed, we executed a $700 million pension lift-out in December, representing about 8% of our total pension liability associated with our former generation subsidiaries. Removing this obligation from our balance sheet at a 5% discount will reduce future earnings volatility related to fluctuations in pension assets and liabilities and lowers overall pension plan costs. We will continue pursuing opportunities to further derisk the pension plan through additional lift-outs and pursuing pension tracking mechanisms through the regulatory process. Now, let's shift gears and talk about our outlook going forward. We are very pleased to introduce our five-year financial plan supporting our commitments to our investors, including 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth with significantly improved earnings quality, investment-grade credit metrics, and dividend growth in line with earnings growth. The cornerstone of this plan is a robust Energized 365 grid evolution investment plan of $26 billion, with approximately 75% of planned investments in formula rate programs that provide real-time returns. The plan includes increasing annual investments in our transmission and distribution system each year, resulting in 9% average annual rate base growth. Energize 365 supersedes our long-standing Energizing the Future transmission program, which we're sunsetting after a decade of strong performance. Our planned targets investments that improve the customer experience and supports the energy transition or new load requirements, while ensuring a fair and reasonable regulated return for our investors. The capital program is 45% weighted in FERC-regulated transmission investments in our stand-alone transmission and integrated businesses, and includes investments to enhance and upgrade the transmission system, add operational flexibility to support projects like New Jersey offshore wind and new data center load and regulatory required projects. On the distribution system, the plan includes investments by our distribution and integrated segments to improve the customer experience through reliability enhancements, grid modernization and clean energy investments such as smart meter deployment, distribution automation and energy efficiency programs. This comprehensive five-year instrument plan is very solid with flexibility to adjust as projects and programs emerge. Over the next couple of years, we anticipate an increase in earnings from our formula rate investment programs and as we rerate base distribution rates for over $19 billion of state regulated rate base. Our plan builds off the approved or settled base rate cases in Maryland, West Virginia and New Jersey, our integrated segment, representing $7 billion in rate base that was earnings 400 basis points below the allowed returns, as well as scheduled base rate cases in Pennsylvania and Ohio later this year, where we have $12 billion in projected rate base in our distribution segment. It is also forecasted to be under earning. The true-up of returns will allow us to earn closer to our allowed regulated returns and to significantly improve the earnings quality of the company with the expected declines in the earnings contribution from Signal Peak. In longer term, annual rate base growth with planned investments in formula rate programs, more timely recovery of base capital investments and cost discipline with our operating expenses will result in less regulatory lag than we've seen historically with modest and reasonable customer bill impacts. We expect our utilities to maintain their strong affordability position and keep rates at/or below our in-state peers. Energize 365 will be funded with cash from operations, which we expect to average $4 billion-plus annually, building off our 2024 cash flow projections, as well as regulated long-term debt issuances and a portion of the $3.5 billion in proceeds from the FET transaction. And our plan does not include any incremental equity needs beyond our existing employee equity programs and it supports FFO to debt of 14% to 15% and FE Corp debt at/or below 20% of total debt. Our 2024 guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 a share represents a 7% increase off the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which will largely be back-end loaded given the timing of new rates in West Virginia and New Jersey and O&M mark plan for Q1 of this year. With this in mind, our projection for the first quarter are operating earnings of $0.48 a share to $0.58 a share. To give you some color on the year-over-year increase, our midpoint of $2.71 a share reflects 12% consolidated regulated growth offset by a decline in Signal Peak's earnings contribution. The increase reflects new rates and investments largely from approved or settled base rate cases in our integrated segment, where we anticipate new rates for our West Virginia and New Jersey settlements to be implemented late in the first quarter and ongoing formula rate investments in each of our businesses. A return to normal weather-related customer demand, higher operating expenses reflecting the timing of O&M activities that I spoke of earlier, and new depreciation rates on our fossil generating facilities as part of the settlement we reached in West Virginia.  It's important to note that our 2024 planned O&M is $140 million or 10% below 2022 levels. And when you adjust for timing such as planned generation outages, our O&M is $100 million or 6% below 2022, reflecting permanent cost reductions. Other drivers include improved earnings quality from the lower earnings contribution from our Signal Peak mining asset and a higher effective tax rate. The dilution from the FET transaction is largely offset by lower interest expense, representing planned debt retirements and interest income from the vendor take-back note as part of the FET transaction. Our $4.3 billion capital investment plan for this year represents a 16% increase compared to 2023. And is largely funded with $4 billion in cash from operations, which has improved year-over-year from several unique items that occurred in 2023, such as the $750 million pension contribution, contract termination costs and severance and employee separation costs, as well as increases from growth and cost recovery in our regulated businesses and improved working capital. With the improvement in cash flow, closing on our FET minority interest sale and deployment of those proceeds, we're targeting 14% to 15% FFO to debt by year-end. 2023 was a challenging but remarkable year, a year of significant transition, innovation and improvement with outstanding operational and financial execution from our 12,000 employees. Today, our company is a much stronger position, and we have a comprehensive plan for continued growth. Thank you for your time today. But before we go to Q&A, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you all for joining us today. I'm excited about our company. We're building a strong track record of execution. We have a fantastic business model and a robust plan for the future. Starting with the initial Brookfield and Blackstone investments announced in late 2021, we have significantly improved the balance sheet via $7 billion in equity capital, and it was raised in a very shareholder-friendly manner, the equivalent of issuing common equity at $87 per share. In the past year, we've achieved several important regulatory milestones, representing constructive outcomes for FirstEnergy and our customers. This includes $219 million of increased revenues through base rate cases that will fuel our investments in reliable and affordable service. Energize 365, our five-year $26 billion investment plan is an increase of more than 44% from our previous five-year capital investment plan and it's funded with organic internal cash flow and utility debt, not incremental equity. We have a long-term 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth trajectory with significantly improved earnings quality. This tremendous work together with the cultural changes and focus on continuous improvement has transformed our company. We have accomplished a lot and we're committed to executing on our plan to deliver the full value of this company to shareholders. Now, let's open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, morning. Just, Brian, good to see the roll forward of the 6% to 8%. I guess as we're thinking about some of the sort of the earnings headwinds like Signal Peak becoming sort of immaterial next year and potential maybe future pension drag, I guess, any sense on how we should think about the linearity of that growth off the 2024 base, could we see some maybe near-term gyrations around the 6% to 8%? Or you have enough contingencies to maintain that linearity? Brian Tierney : Shar, it's going to be really linear. We're not going to see much volatility. We're getting back to where a normal utility should look like. We're going to be investing in our regulated properties. And obviously, a lot of that recovery is going to come through formula-based rates. So that is -- tends to be linear, about 75% through formula-based rates. And then we're going to be regularly going in for rate cases. And it's just the normal cadence of how a utility operates. You invest, you operate, you recover and you finance. And that's the cadence that we're going to be on. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And the 9% rate base growth is obviously very solid. Is there still I guess, some incremental CapEx opportunities we should be thinking about in the five-year plan. I know, obviously, Jon highlighted some flexibility there in the prepareds, and then any sort of rule of thumb we should think about if there is incremental equity -- incremental CapEx? Could it come with incremental equity? Or you have enough cushion in the credit metrics to not have to tap the equity markets even if there's incremental CapEx? Brian Tierney : Yes. I think we have enough cushion for sure. And we're seeing things like the PJM Open Window 3 that we responded to, where the team worked really hard to put together a solution in a short period of time, and we were able to garner over $800 million of incremental investment through that opportunity. I see more of those coming. They're not in our capital plan yet, and they won't be until we win the projects. But there's significant amounts of new CapEx that's not in our plan that I anticipate will see coming down, and we'll be able to fund that through a combination of cash flow from operations, debt equity issuances and things like the $3.5 billion of equity that's going to come into our system in 2024 from the transaction. So we're ready to fund these incremental CapEx, the way a traditional utility would without having to see much access for equity from the equity capital markets. Shar Pourreza : Okay. And I think \u2013 sorry... Brian Tierney : No, no. I would just reiterate kind of what you said. I mean had we not done the transactions over the course of the last couple of years, raising $7 billion of equity capital, really at the equivalent of a 36 times PE multiple, we wouldn't be in this position today. I think a lot of it depends on formula rate CapEx versus base capital. I think if you look at some of our utility capital structures, they have equity layers that are a little bit better than our targeted equity capital structure. So we have some flexibility in the plan. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And just real quick, lastly, on just -- Brian, I think you answered this, but on the OOCIC process. It doesn't sound like there's any updates its status close. So is it fair to assume -- I haven't seen the K yet, but when it's released, we shouldn't see anything surprising in that. Brian Tierney : Yes. No surprises at all, Shar. Status quo, they ask questions, we answer them, and nothing new with regards to the company from what was disclosed in the deferred prosecution agreement. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic guys. Really Brian, awesome execution. Appreciate it. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Our next question is from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Thanks. Congratulations on rolling out the new plan. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Gregg. Gregg Orrill : So, just on cash from operations guidance. Is the guidance that the new base for growth is $4 billion and you grow off of that? Or it that's the average over the plan and there's sort of -- it's down and then you're above that level toward the end of the plan? Jon Taylor : Yes, Gregg, this is Jon. In all years, it will be $4 billion or more of cash from operations. Some of it will be just growth in our regulated programs, offset by maybe some changes in working capital. But on average, over the five-year period, it will be north of $4 billion. Gregg Orrill : Okay. Maybe just a follow-up for Brian. How do you sort of reconcile the idea of coming forward with the new plan that adds such a significant amount of new capital to the prior plan? Brian Tierney : We're in a different place, Gregg. The work that's been done on the balance sheet since 2021, as we laid out, has been truly transformative. For the first time, I think, in the company's history, we're not distracted by M&A. We don't have a competitive arm. We have a strong balance sheet with the opportunity to invest in our regulated, mostly wires companies that, to be honest with, we got behind in the capital investment in them. And that's why our rate base is lower. It's why our rates are lower. And it's why we have some significant opportunities with regards to reliability and the customer experience.  We are here for the first time, ready, willing and able to put the money into our regulated properties for the benefit of our customers, and it is a significant difference from what you've seen in the past. Gregg Orrill : Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, good morning. Happy Friday. Thanks for all the updates. I guess, just to follow-up on Gregg's question, because the CapEx raise is pretty material across the board, obviously it's good to see, Just how should we kind of think about customer bill growth to achieve this plan, as it relates to just the upcoming filings and then just through the plan as well, please? Brian Tierney : Yes. So we think the increases will be in the single-digit for most of the time for the five-year period. If you look Nicholas, at Page 23 in the fact book that we put out there in New Jersey through West Virginia and Maryland, our rates are 22% to 30% below our in-state peers. And in Ohio, they're -- and in Pennsylvania, they're 3% to 7% below our in-state peers. A lot of that in New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland represents opportunities to invest in the rate base and improve the customer experience. But also more importantly, if you look at things like customer affordability between 1997 and 2022, our customers' electricity share of wallet has decreased to 1.3% from 1.6%. So, when we talk to smart people who cover our industry and they say that you need to start getting concerned when you're at 4% to 5% share of your customers' wallet, we're nowhere near that. And electricity, whether it's for home heating, whether it's to power your vehicles or whatever, still represents a considerable value for the customers in the states we serve. Jon Taylor : Nick, this is Jon and I'll just add on to that. If you look at the cases where we have approvals or settlements on file in our integrated business, if you just kind of compare to where we were since the last rate case, it's an average of 1% or 1% lower than the last time, if you do that on an annual basis. And in fact, if you step back a little bit more and just look at the increases in customer bills over the last couple of years, most of that is generation related. And if we were to snap the line today with new generation service, for instance, in Ohio and Pennsylvania, you would see bill decreases of somewhere between 4% and 8%. Nicholas Campanella : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just kind of a similar question on what's embedded in the plan here. And I'm just thinking about earned ROEs, obviously, New Jersey is pretty low here, that will improve with the settlement. How do we think about kind of Ohio? And if you get an improvement versus your slides here, is that baked into the plan or just how should we kind of think about that? Brian Tierney : Yes. As we talked about, the next couple of years will be very important as we true-up our state-regulated returns to more of their allowed return. So, I think about Ohio and Pennsylvania, which will be next to file. Ohio right now is earning sub-6%. Some of that is weather-driven, but we do see an opportunity to true-up the return there. And then in Pennsylvania, although it's above 9%, a lot of the O&M that's coming back in the system will be in our Pennsylvania company, which will reduce the ROE there. And we use a projected test year for our Pennsylvania company. So, you'll be adding about $1 billion of rate base between where it is today and the filing that we'll make later this year. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. And then just one last one, just on the load growth, 1% embedded in the plan. Places at PJM have just continued to see demand revisions higher and I'm just wondering if that's conservative at all? Brian Tierney : So, like capital projects and other things, we don't want to put forecast growth in until we're seeing it and we're seeing it at about that 1% range. As things develop and go forward, like you've seen data centers in PJM and the like, we think we're going to get that here. You're seeing it to the south of us, you're seeing it to the east of us, and I think that migration will continue into our service territory. In fact, we fully believe it will. And then as you see other things like electrification of transportation and the like, I think there is some upside in the loan growth, we just don't want to bake it into the plan until we're seeing it in our confident that it's coming. Nicholas Campanella : All right. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nicolas. You too. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Michael Sullivan : Hi, everyone. Hey, guys thanks for all the new disclosures. Just in terms of -- you mentioned milestones on the regulatory front. How should we think about Grid Mod II and the ESP playing out over the next couple of months? And how, if any, that can inform the base rate filing coming in May in Ohio? Brian Tierney : Yeah. So, we're working those regulatory processes, and you're going to see that from us. You're going to see certain things are in flight and certain things are coming, and look for us to be making progress on what's in flight, and that will foreshadow what's coming down the road. ESP V and Grid Mod II, we're working through those regulatory processes. I was reviewing last night, and we'll file today, our post-hearing briefing on ESP V, and we expect a constructive outcome there as we do in Grid Mod II. But regulatory tends not to move very fast. These are months long processes. And we think that the processes in both ESP V and Grid Mod II are constructive. And we anticipate it will be the same, but an actually longer process for our base rate case, which we'll file in April of this year. So we're just moving along. Things are happening as they should, and we're getting these constructive outcomes. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then just on pension and limiting volatility there. Can you just give a sense on where we go forward, how much more lift out can potentially be done? And then just how you're feeling about ability to implement mechanisms? I know there were some language around that in some of the cases you already had, but nothing too prescriptive, I don't think. So, yeah, just the path forward on limiting pension volatility? Thank you. Jon Taylor : Yeah, Michael. So we have another $700 million of former generation pension liabilities that we're looking at right now as to whether or not we should execute a lift-out transaction, something that we'll likely do this year if the market conditions warrant that. And then on the regulatory front, as we talked about before, some of these things take a couple of bites at the apple before we can get them in place. We did get authority to at least make a filing in West Virginia and New Jersey as part of the settlements. And we'll be thoughtful once we go through that process and get a final order on the cases as to the next steps there. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. Thanks. Just last one, maybe a little more philosophical, but just seeing how the reporting season has gone so far, I think we've seen a lot of your peers going the other direction in terms of dividend payout and growth. And I know you're coming from a different starting point, but maybe just how you think about that in the context of the sector not trading well, and just other levers that you have, how you thought about continuing to grow the dividend with earnings and the payout where you have it? Brian Tierney : Yeah. So we are at a different place than our peers. Announcing the increase that we did in September, the first in over three years, it's time to start rewarding our shareholders with dividend increases. And we felt that now is the time to do that. So September and anticipated in 2024, increases there as well. It's time for us to treat our shareholders the way utility companies traditionally do. And we're in a place where we're going to be growing the dividend with earnings over time. Our balance sheet is healthy. We don't have the equity needs that some of our peers do because of the transactions that we've done over the last three years or so. So we're in a different place and where some of our peers are, and we think it's a really good place. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Jeremy. How are you today? Jeremy Tonet : Good, good. Thank you. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on the guide here, talking about rate-based CAGR of 9% relative to 6% to 8% EPS CAGR without additional equity needs. So it's just looking to kind of marry those two data points, given the stronger pace of rate-based growth there. If there's anything else we should be thinking about, especially the signal peak and pension OPEB become a smaller part of the equation? Brian Tierney : It's really the things that we mentioned in our remarks. It's going in for base rate cases and updating rate base, updating returns, cost structure, and those things that haven't been done in some time. You know, the three cases, Maryland, New Jersey, and West Virginia that we've just been in, Pennsylvania and Ohio coming up this year, it's a significant amount of updating the regulatory process and recovery, and then increasing, as we've announced today with Energize 365, the CapEx that we're going to be investing in our regulated properties going forward. So it's the way utility operations should work. And I repeat this over and over again internally. You invest in your properties and your people. You operate safely, reliably, affordably. You go in for recovery. And if you've done invest and operate well, the recovery component goes better when you're in front of our regulators. And then we come before investors and we tell them the story that we put together on those first three components and financing the companies easier as well. So we're in a place where we're at the beginning of what I call that virtuous cycle and the success that we've had and the rate cases that I discussed in my prepared remarks show that we're getting those fair and constructive outcomes, and we anticipate that going forward in the plan as well. It all holds together as a credible story where we're having success at the beginning point of that. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Maybe to rephrase the question slightly, just if the rate-based CAGR is 9%, are there any other drags besides lag to make EPS growth only 6% to 8%? Or is that a degree of conservatism? Jon Taylor : So Jeremy, I would say it this year, just as you saw in 2024, the 2024 guide, you saw the step down in signal peak from $0.24 to $0.12. You'll see another step down from 2024 to 2025, but at the same time, that's when we're truing up these rate bases that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the $7 billion this year, the $12 billion that we'll file in Pennsylvania and Ohio for this year. And then after that, it's more traditional rate base growth, a little bit of regulatory lag, but we're going to do everything we can to minimize any difference between our earned returns and our allowed returns. Brian Tierney : I think it's important to note that the part that Jon mentioned about pension and Signal Peak decreasing, as they decrease and as the traditional regulatory component of our growth increases, our earnings quality improves, and that happens really, really quickly in our plan. So that's also a benefit. It's not just growing earnings, it's a reduced risk profile as well. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. Very helpful. And then I just wanted to go back, I guess, to customer bill impacts. And I think you quoted some helpful numbers there as far as share of wallet that the bill will represent in New Jersey. But I just want to see, I guess, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, is it kind of similar share of wallet expectations over the forecast period? Or any color you can provide there? Jon Taylor : It is. That was -- the numbers that I gave you of share of wallet was an average across our five states. So -- and it's not significantly different in any one of those, but it's very, very low. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Due to time constraints, we ask to you please limit to one question. Our next question comes from Michael Lonegan with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lonegan : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Michael. Michael Lonegan : So you've talked about some sustainable O&M you've taken out of your business and a larger increase this year and then have to that account for less than 2% increases over time. Given the significant ramp-up in CapEx over the years of your planning period, presumably, you'd have to expand your workforce or use of contractors is my guess to work on complete all those projects. I was just wondering, how are you planning on managing your O&M within that 2% increase level? Is there room to take out more existing costs out of the business? Brian Tierney : So I'll say this. A lot of what we talked about is actually CapEx that we're increasing. So it's not directly related to O&M. We recognize there's an O&M tail that's associated with any incremental CapEx, but we're going to be very, very focused on continuous improvement. And it's going to be part of our story that we're going to tell every time we're getting together going forward about how -- what we've been able to do and how we've been able to reduce O&M through continuous improvement. And it's just going to be part of our story going forward like it was in 2023. And you see well-functioning premium utilities are always talking about what they're doing in that regard. And we've had success here in our recent past doing that, and we anticipate that going forward. Michael Lonegan : Great. Thank you very much. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. Just a bigger picture question. So investors seem excited about the load growth accelerating loan growth associated with data centers, the obvious way to play this trend, this through generation companies, but also through vertically integrated utilities that actually own generation. You guys except for Virginia, a wires-only business. And I'm just wondering if you do expect to have this secondary benefit associated with the load growth, again, translating into either higher T&D CapEx, or maybe improved affordability because of higher volumes. I mean, you name it. Just wondering if you see that benefit accruing to you as well. Brian Tierney : Thank you for the question, Angie. We absolutely do. And you're right, being mostly a wires company, certainly in four of our five states. We don't have as much of the generation opportunity. But I mentioned in my remarks, or in answer to an earlier question, the opportunity that we had associated with the PJM Open Window 3 for incremental transmission investment over $800 million. I had the pleasure of going out to our Maryland service territory late last year and got to go see what's going on at that quantum loophole data center development, it is unbelievable what's going on out there. They are recreating something that's on the scale of the data center footprint in Northern Virginia, out kind of in the hills of Western Maryland. And it's at a site of a former aluminum smelter out there. So you have these high-voltage transmission lines that go and just stop in the middle of space where the smelter used to be and where they're investing, they're turning dirt, they're moving ground right now, to build one of the largest data center complexes in the world. So we're seeing it in Maryland. It's going to be coming to Pennsylvania, in Ohio for us as well, and we're hopeful for New Jersey and West Virginia over time. So, it's coming, and it's real, and it does create incremental investment opportunities for us. Angie Storozynski : And then just one last follow-up. So you mentioned affordability. Your rates are obviously so much lower than your peers. Your assets seem underinvested when you look at rate base per customer. But I'm just wondering because all of these investments or acceleration of investment happens in a low power price environment, given the load growth, the low power price environment is not sustainable. So, I'm just wondering what happens to that investment plan when power prices go up meaningfully. And so the customer bill meaningful increases because of that commodity component. Brian Tierney : So it's a good question, Angie. I think we've already seen some of that associated with things like the war in Ukraine and the like. And we saw that in some of the polar prices that we have when we went out for auctions during the period when we thought prices were going to be really, really high because of what's going on in Europe. And some of those price spikes went through to our customers, really in Ohio, beginning like the day I started on June 1 of last year. So we saw some of those price spikes go through to customer rates, and now they're coming off. As John mentioned earlier, we're having auctions that are printing lower prices and those lower prices are passing through to our customers. So I don't see that as being a big concern. There are some things that are moderating that impact. And again, our prices are so low. The share of wallet is so low for us that electricity still represents a significant value to customers in all five of our states. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : Hey guys. Congratulations. Brian Tierney : Good morning Paul. Paul Patterson : Just wanted to sort of touch base again, I apologize, on this this single-digit increase, is that rates or is it bills? And can you be a little bit more specific in terms of what that means -- obviously, there's a big range there, right? Just a little bit more elaboration as to what you see sort of the rate trajectory range being associated with the with what you're planning long-term? Jon Taylor : Paul, so this is Jon. So, I would tell you that as we think about the cases that we filed this year, the increases since the last rate case are single-digits, like low, low single digits. So, on average-- Paul Patterson : New Jersey was 3.4%. Jon Taylor : Yes. But on an average basis since the last rate case, it's probably less than 1% a year. Paul Patterson : And that's what you see going forward? Is that -- when you -- low single-digits is what you guys been? Jon Taylor : Well, I think you got to think of it this way, we haven't been in for a rate case in Pennsylvania for quite some time. Ohio, we haven't been in almost over a decade. So, I do think there'll be some increases there. But when you average it out since the time of the last rate case, it's very manageable. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then finally, on Grid Mod, do you see any settlement possibility? I know you guys sort of had thought about that before. There was sort of a delay in staff testimony. It looks like you're now talking about hearings. You expect that to be fully litigated at this point? Brian Tierney : Look, we're always open to the settlement option and think that's always preferable. If we're going to go to hearing like we have in ESP 5, we're okay with that. We think we'll get positive outcomes. And in any regard, Paul, the settlement discussions that we have start to frame people's positions for where they'll be at the table at a hearing. And so we view it as being a constructive process even if we have to go to hearing. Paul Patterson : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much guys. Have a good weekend. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Paul. Thanks. You too. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, could you refresh us on any strategic options that might be available for the Signal Peak business as you're thinking about that now? Jon Taylor : In this environment, there's not a lot of options. Obviously, we look at that quite frequently. It's not a core business for us. We've looked at that in the past several times, it's just -- there's not a lot of buyers out there. And so the options are fairly limited. But if you think about it in the grand scheme of things, it's going to be such a de minimis part of our company moving forward that it's not going to have the same impact that it's had the last couple of years. David Arcaro : Of course, great. That makes sense. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Brian Tierney : Good morning Sophie. Sophie Karp : Most of my questions have been answered -- most of my questions have been answered. Maybe I can just ask you about the balance sheet. Are you completely happy with the balance sheet shape at this point? And if not, what are the incremental goals here in terms of credit ratings, incremental balance sheet strength? Or are you completely satisfied that you kind of done? Brian Tierney : Yes. Thank you for the question, Sophie. We are really pleased with the shape of the balance sheet at this point. We're going to get the incremental $3.5 billion in the door in 2024, most of that coming in March of this year anticipated with the Brookfield transaction, that caps off what's a total of about a $7 billion raise over the last three years. That work has been intentional and purposeful by the Board and the management team even before I got here, for sure, to strengthen that balance sheet. So we'd be in the position that we are today to be able to invest the way that we've laid out for you today in our regulated properties. We anticipate by the end of 2024 being at 2024 of being at a 14% to 15% FFO to that range. And we're anticipating rating agency positive actions associated with the strength of our balance sheet. So we're really, really pleased with where we are from a balance sheet strength situation. Jon Taylor : Yes. And Sophie, I would just add, if you think about where the company has come from withholding company debt probably in the 30% plus range, Today, it's 26% with a plan to get it to 20% or better by 2026. And that's a strong story. And it really started back in late 2021 when we announced the \u2013 the equity transactions with Blackstone and Brookfield and then we followed it up with a second transaction with FET for another $3.5 billion. And we all did that in a very shareholder-friendly way. So we're excited about where the balance sheet is headed, and we wouldn't have this capital plan without the strong balance sheet that we have. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you so much. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Sophie. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. Thanks you squeezing me in. I had five questions, Shar ask them all though. But just, I guess, quickly -- you've had a big eight months. I appreciate the CapEx update. It seems that you've accomplished a lot of what you were planning. Just the year ahead, what should we expect? Brian Tierney : So I think more of the same, Anthony, thank you for the question. So we've talked about how we're reorganizing the company about how we're changing the segment reporting to reflect that. I mentioned some of the key hires that we made at the end of 2023, we have six more key hires that we need to make. The five people to run our major businesses and a shared services executive that we're looking for as well. So as we make progress on that, we'll then have the team ready to help move in the direction that we've laid out for you. And execute against the plan that we've described today. So it's really getting the right people in the right seats to manage the company the way that we've laid out for you and execute against the fantastic plan that we have. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Again, congrats. Thanks again for taking the question. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Anthony. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And this concludes today's conference for today. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, Irene. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. This morning, I will review financial performance and highlights for the first quarter, provide some updates on key regulatory developments and review FirstEnergy's shareholder value proposition. For the first quarter, FirstEnergy delivered GAAP earnings of $0.44 per share compared to $0.51 per share in 2023. Operating earnings were $0.55 per share, $0.02 higher than the midpoint of guidance for the quarter versus $0.60 per share last year. It is important to note that higher revenues from investments to better serve our customers and more favorable weather compared to last year were offset by higher planned O&M expenses and the expected decrease in Signal Peak earnings resulted in higher quality utility earnings for the quarter. Jon will provide additional details later in the call. During the last earnings call, we announced our 5-year $26 billion investment program to better serve our customers, branded as Energize365. That plan, combined with our ongoing regulatory updates and our continuous improvement program, give us the confidence to affirm our 6% to 8% long-term operating growth rate. We are also affirming our operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 per share for 2024. We are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share for the second quarter of this year. Our confidence in the future gave us the opportunity to increase our dividend again to $0.425 per share payable in June. On an annual basis, this would represent an increase of 6.25% versus dividends declared in 2023. We are continuing to make progress on recruiting and hiring executives to run our 5 primary businesses. We expect to make announcements in the near-term. Earlier this month, we announced the hiring of John Combs as our Senior Vice President of Shared Services. John was most recently an SVP and Chief Technology Officer at JPMorgan Chase. John's deep background in technology and leadership as well as his financial acumen, make him the perfect person to lead our IT, supply chain, flight operations and corporate and cybersecurity organizations. We are thrilled to welcome John to the team. On March 25, FirstEnergy closed on the final phase of our multiyear $7 billion equity raise to improve our balance sheet and fuel our growth. We received $2.3 billion of the $3.5 billion proceeds with a balance in interest-bearing notes that are expected to be repaid this year. We are excited to have Brookfield as our partner in the fast-growing transmission segment of our business. The impact of this transaction on FirstEnergy, as the final phase of the $7 billion equity raise, cannot be overstated. The total equity on the balance sheet increased 25% in the 3 months ended March 31. That's truly remarkable for a company of FirstEnergy's size. For the first time in this company's history, we are fully regulated, mostly wires, with a strong balance sheet that enables organic investment in our utility companies to improve reliability and our customers' experience. Following the closing of the transaction, Moody's recognized the impact of the company by upgrading FirstEnergy Corp.'s senior unsecured rating to investment grade. On Tuesday, S&P upgraded FirstEnergy's corporate credit rating to BBB and our senior unsecured rating to investment grade with a positive outlook. The balance sheet strength and clean business model represented on this slide capture a lot about what excited me to come to FirstEnergy. Let me provide some updates on key regulatory initiatives. People have asked us how they will know when we are making progress on our regulatory plan. I tell them to look for milestones where we are getting fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes. During the quarter, we proved that we can obtain constructive regulatory outcomes across our jurisdictions. We received approval of our rate case settlement in New Jersey, authorizing a 9.6% ROE and a 52% equity capitalization ratio. Even with this increase, JCP&L's rates remain 26% below our in-state peers. The West Virginia Public Service Commission approved constructive depreciation and base rate case settlements. In addition, they approved an expanded net energy fuel charge settlement for recovery of about $0.25 billion through 2026 with no disallowances. For investors looking for milestones that FirstEnergy can obtain fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes, we provided several examples during the quarter. Jon will provide additional detail on the results in his remarks. For the balance of the year, we have an active regulatory schedule. In Ohio, we filed a settlement in our Grid Mod II case, asking for the opportunity to complete our advanced meter infrastructure rollout over 4 years. A hearing is scheduled for June 5. Approval of this noncontroversial settlement will bring us to parity with our in-state peers. We are expecting approval of our ESP V filing this quarter, and we will file a base rate case next month. That case will seek a modest increase in base rates, but we'll reset a number of riders since the last base rate case. Earlier this month, in Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case requesting an 11.3% ROE and a 53.8% equity ratio. We expect a decision in December, with rates effective in January of next year. Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to highlight the value proposition that FirstEnergy offers to shareholders. We have completed the multiyear overhaul of our balance sheet and have achieved investment-grade status at both Moody's and S&P. Our strong balance sheet differentiates FirstEnergy from many of our industry peers and that we do not anticipate incremental equity needs to fund our $26 billion investment plan. Our long-term annual operating earnings growth rate, combined with our dividend yield, represent a total shareholder return potential of 10% to 12%. Our earnings quality is vastly improved, driven by growth in our core regulated businesses and our customers' affordability remains strong throughout the investment period. At the end of a significant business transition led by our Board of Directors and management team, FirstEnergy represents a high-quality and attractive risk value proposition to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon. K. Taylor: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite another mild winter, we are off to a good start this year with strong execution and financial discipline from our team that resulted in operating earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. And we are reaffirming our full year operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 a share, which represents a 7% increase versus the midpoint of our 2023 guidance. Today, I'll review financial performance for the quarter, our progress on key strategic regulatory initiatives and close with some details around the balance sheet. Looking at our financial performance for the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.55 a share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance despite the mild temperatures this winter that impacted retail sales and includes a planned increase in operating expenses as discussed on the fourth quarter call. This compares to 2023 first quarter operating earnings of $0.60 a share. As we also mentioned on the fourth quarter call, earnings growth this year will be back-end loaded, given the effective dates of rate cases in West Virginia and New Jersey, and planned increases in operating expenses in the first half of this year associated with the timing of maintenance work. Our first quarter results are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website last night. At a consolidated level, first quarter earnings of $0.55 per share were impacted by higher planned operating expenses and improved earnings quality from an expected decrease in earnings from Signal Peak, partially offset by increases from new base rates and rate base growth in formula rate programs. And although customer demand was not a significant driver year-over-year given the mild winter in the first quarter of 2023, retail sales were down 6% versus planned, primarily associated with heating degree days that were 14% below normal, impacting results by $0.07 a share versus our plan. So let's also take a few minutes to review our segment results, which you will notice in our filings and presentation, the segment reporting change, consistent with how we're managing the business. We are now organized into easy-to-follow segments of distribution, integrated stand-alone transmission and corporate. This streamlined and transparent reporting places entire companies and individual segments, simplifying reporting and eliminating reconciliations. In our Distribution business, operating earnings were $0.30 a share versus $0.33 per share in the first quarter of last year, impacted largely by the planned increase in operating expenses I mentioned earlier, specifically around vegetation management work, partially offset by an increase in rates from capital investment programs and lower rate credits in Ohio. In our Integrated segment, operating earnings were $0.15 a share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of last year. Results increased largely due to the implementation of base rates in all 3 jurisdictions in this business and rate base growth in formula rate programs, including integrated transmission investments, partially offset by planned increases in operating expenses. In our stand-alone transmission segment, operating earnings were $0.18 a share versus $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2023, resulting from a 9% year-over-year rate base growth from our formula rate transmission capital investment program. And finally, in our corporate segment, losses were $0.08 per share versus $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the lower planned earnings contribution from our 1/3 ownership interest in the Signal Peak mining operation, decreasing from $0.08 per share in the first quarter of last year to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of this year. Turning briefly to capital investments. First quarter CapEx totaled just under $900 million, an increase of nearly 22% versus 2023 levels and slightly ahead of our plan across each of our businesses, focusing on grid modernization, transmission and infrastructure renewal investments. As a reminder, CapEx for this year is planned at $4.3 billion versus $3.7 billion in 2023. Turning to regulatory activity. We are very pleased with the outcomes in the recent base rate case orders, consistent with our plan that allows for solid regulated returns for our investors while keeping rates affordable for customers. And we're committed to our customers and our communities to enhance reliability performance and support the energy transition through our Energize365 capital investment program. As Brian mentioned, in mid-February, the New Jersey BPU issued a final order on JCP&L's base rate case. The new rates, which customers will see effective June 1 and continue to be well below our in-state peer average, represent an $85 million rate adjustment on rate base totaling $3 billion, an ROE of 9.6% and a 52% equity capitalization ratio. And we are currently working through our Energize New Jersey infrastructure improvement proposal initially filed in November, including over $900 million in capital investments over 5 years aimed to enhance reliability and modernize the distribution system. In West Virginia, on March 26, we received a final order from the Public Service Commission on our base rate case with rates effective March 27. The case resulted in a $105 million rate adjustment on rate base of $3.2 billion, an allowed ROE of 9.8% and a 49.6% equity ratio. Rates for our West Virginia customers remain about 22% below our in-state peers. Additionally, as Brian mentioned, in West Virginia, we received an order on our ENEC case for an increase of $55 million. We have been successful in reducing the $255 million deferral down to $168 million with full recovery expected by 2026. Now let's move on to current activity with Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, we filed a base rate case requesting a $502 million rate adjustment on rate base of $7.2 billion, an 11.3% proposed return on equity and a 53.8% equity capitalization ratio. The case builds on our service reliability enhancements in the state with additional investments in a smart, modern energy grid and customer-focused programs while keeping rates comparable to other Pennsylvania utilities. Key components of the case include implementing a 10-year enhanced vegetation management program to reduce tree caused outages, reduce outage restoration time and reduce future maintenance costs, recovery of costs associated with major storms, COVID-19 and LED streetlight conversions and changing pension and OPEB recovery to the delayed recognition method, which is based on traditional pension expense with amortization of previously recognized cumulative actuarial losses. The case also includes a blended federal state statutory tax rate of approximately 27%, but also continues to provide customer savings from previous changes to federal and state tax rates. Additionally, the application proposes a pension OPEB normalization mechanism to track and defer differences between actual and test year expense using the delayed recognition method. In addition to the base rate case, we plan to file a third phase of our long-term infrastructure improvement program this summer, which will include capital investment programs to improve reliability for the customers of Pennsylvania. And finally, turning to Ohio. Earlier this month, we filed a settlement for the second phase of our distribution grid modernization plan, Grid Mod II. The settlement includes a $421 million 4-year capital investment program to continue modernizing the distribution electric system by completing the deployment of 1.4 million smart meters to our customers in Ohio. Finally, next week, we plan to file a prefiling notice of our Ohio base rate case with a full application and supporting schedules by the end of May. Key highlights of the case will include a 2024 test year with over $4.3 billion in rate base and an equity capitalization ratio reflecting the actual capital structure of the companies, a plan to recover investments in riders' DCR and AMI, which includes the Grid Mod capital investments in base rates and reset those riders to 0 and some of the same other features that we included in other rate case applications, including pension recovery and pension tracking mechanisms. The current expectation is a proposal of a modest net increase to customers of less than $100 million compared to current revenues and an overall average impact of less than 5% of total revenues across all customers which will be refined over the coming months. And finally, just to touch on the balance sheet and the closing of the FET transaction. Obviously, a lot of hard work goes into any transaction like this, but this was a great team effort, and we couldn't be more pleased with the results. Of the $3.5 billion in total proceeds, $2.3 billion was received at the end of March and was deployed immediately, consistent with our plan to pay off short-term debt and to redeem long-term debt totaling close to $1.4 billion, of which $460 million was at FE Corp. We expect to receive the remaining $1.2 billion later this year, which will be used to fund our capital programs and additional liability management, depending on market conditions. This transaction completes a series of transactions over the last 2.5 years that resulted in over $3 billion in high-cost debt redemptions at FE Corp., close to $2 billion in utility long-term debt redemptions and $2 billion to pay off short-term debt that would have otherwise been financed with long-term debt at our utilities. And we are pleased to be back with an investment-grade credit rating with all 3 rating agencies and understand and appreciate and respect the importance of this to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time today. We're off to a solid start this year with strong execution and a significantly stronger balance sheet to fuel our growth going forward. Now let's open the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So Brian, I know obviously, Jon and Brian thanks for the color on the Ohio case, I think it touched on some of the questions I had on that. But look, the state is likely going to become sort of this epicenter for hyperscalers. So I guess I'm curious if there's going to be any sort of kind of data center-focused rate design or tariff filings in this case to maybe account kind of for these opportunities, especially to trying to balance the impact to other customers while trying to track this business? And then maybe just as a follow-up there, Brian, how is the dialogue going with data centers in general? Brian Tierney : So let me start with the second one. The dialogue with data centers is really positive. We've been out to see Josh Snowhorn, and his team out of Quantum Loophole right outside of Frederick, Maryland, it's amazing what they have going on there. It's kind of fascinating to see. We have 2 230 kV lines that end in an open field where there used to be an aluminum smelter and now Josh and his team were building that huge data center complex. So we're in direct dialogue with them. They will be one of our biggest customers over time and look forward to continuing that dialogue.  We're also seeing as things like expand out from data center hubs from Northern Virginia. Now you're seeing in the Panhandle of Maryland, the Quantum Loophole folks. We're seeing the same thing in Ohio. And as things expand out from Central Ohio, the place where I used to work, and it's coming up into our service territory as well. And we're also seeing interest in Pennsylvania.  Given what's happened with a number of power plant retirements over the years, our service territory has ample brownfield sites that are -- have land available and connectivity to the high-voltage transmission system. So we think we're well positioned for some of that growth. We're continuing to invest as we go forward. The PJM open data center 3 that we're able to fund about $800 million to help enable that growth. We're excited about the opportunity going forward.  Jon, I don't know, are we doing anything tariff-wise to attract these? Or are we well set up given the tariffs that we have? K. Taylor: Shar, that's a really good question. I think it's something that we will take a look at over time. Our tariffs are set up or such that some of these customers would be transmission-related customers. So the revenue uplift to the distribution companies wouldn't be as significant as you would see maybe in a residential customer, and that's by design. So it is something that I think over time we'll take a look at as well as I'm sure other utilities will take a look at. But at this point in time, we don't have anything that we're planning for. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. That's perfect. And then, Brian, lastly for me and sorry, I got to ask this, but it's causing a little bit of angst this morning with investors. There's some new language in the queue kind of mentioning on potential fines coming from the OOCIC, I guess how do you book in the range of outcomes there? I know, obviously, the language is not going to be super material. But is there any kind of sort of read-throughs or knock-on effects on the ongoing PUCO investigations or any other investigations there? Brian Tierney : I don't think so, Shar. Thanks for the question. There are 2 new things that we raised in that OOCIC disclosure. One was at the beginning of the disclosure, we talked about -- we have traditionally talked about there being nothing that we were aware of that was outside of the DPA. Well, during the quarter, the OOCIC-brought indictments against householder for things that had nothing to do with the DPA, and we were unaware of that activity, which they found and obtained indictments on. And the other component is in regards to that investigation as well as the Attorney General has a civil suit against the company. We'd like to put both those past us and we may have to put a little bit of money on the table to do that. So we don't think it will be material, but we'd like to put a period on both those issues as it relates to the company and move on.  I think some of you saw the language that the Attorney General used in the prior indictments when he complemented the company on its cooperation with his office, and viewed us as a victim of the offenses that took place. So we think it's a constructive relationship, and we just like to put a period on it and move on from there. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Michael Sullivan : Maybe just -- I know you're about to file this year and I appreciate all the kind of upfront detail on Ohio. But maybe if you could just give a little more on how you are able to keep the rate hike request so low in Ohio after being out for so long? Brian Tierney : Yes. So a lot of the activity that we're doing is taking things that have been handled in riders during that interim period and putting it in base rates. So things that customers were always paying for, but they weren't in base rates. So there's no customer increase associated with that. And then we're looking at refreshing the ROE, some cost structures, and we anticipate that those things will be $100 million or less in terms of gross increase, and we expect the net impact on customer rates to be less than 5%. K. Taylor: Yes, Michael, I'll expand just a little bit. If you think about rider DCR, that's been in place for over 10 years now and we've been able to earn on pretty much all of our investments in the distribution system over those 10 years. And to give you a sense of magnitude, that rider alone is close to $400 million annually. And then if you look at the Grid Mod rider, that probably got kicked off a few years ago with our Grid Mod I implementation, it's close to $100 million.  So over the years, even though base rates haven't changed in over 10-plus years, we've been able to increase the returns on our investments through those riders. And a lot of this case is just moving those riders into base rates. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's super helpful. Just a quick follow-up on that. With respect to the riders, does the outcome here in the next month in ESP V and how riders are treated there have any impact on how you approach the base rate case filing? K. Taylor: No, I don't think so, Michael. I mean, this is capital that has been prudently spent. It's been on distribution reliability. I think it's been subject to audits in the past. So I think that is simply going to be moved from those riders into base rates. And if you look at the past in other jurisdictions, you really don't have an issue with moving capital that you've deployed in riders in the base rates. That's typically fairly straightforward in any type of rate proceeding. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Makes sense. And last one for me, Jon. Just the -- congrats on getting back to IG and just what are we thinking for timing and prospects for maybe even mid-BBB, sounds like you have the metrics to support it. Is it doable at both agencies and potential timing there? K. Taylor: Yes. I'm not going to speak for the agencies, but S&P left us on a positive outlook. And I think they're looking for the expiration of the deferred prosecution agreement, which will be in July of this year. I think we also need to build a track record of hitting our forecast, and I think that's going to take some time to do that. And so that's what I think they're looking for and that's what our plan is. Operator : Next question is coming from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to kind of touch base, I guess, on how things are progressing against strategic initiatives to kind of realign the organization, bring in new hires, decentralized decision-making and assigned KPIs further down the structure. How is that being received? How do you see, I guess, the culture changing? Just wondering any thoughts on how that's progressing? Brian Tierney : Thank you for that question, Jeremy. It's progressing really well. So we've added Toby Thomas as the Chief Operating Officer; Wade Smith, as the head of FE Utilities; and we just announced John Combs coming in. And these folks are hitting the ground running, making an impact right away.  If you look at how we're managing the company, we're managing it the way we're reporting it in segments now by those 5 major operating companies that we have. And things like Energize365, that is organized and planned according to those major business units. So the plans that summarize up to that $26 billion spend over 5 years, are all coming from those major business units. And they have the plans to put that capital to work for the benefit of our customers by business unit. And so it's working the way we thought it would. It's -- we've transitioned from a CapEx that's kind of break fix, repair in kind to one that gets our customers ahead in terms of reliability and gives us the opportunity to improve the customer experience rather than just treading water. And the transaction that both Jon and I talked about in our remarks, enables that, right? You can't make the type of investments that we're talking about making without the strong balance sheet that we've had through the capital raises over time.  So everything is coming together and working as it should. The money is [ come in ] the door. The balance sheet is strong. And we have the plans by business unit to put the dollars to work, and you're seeing it from '23 to '24, and we have plans going out for 4 additional years as well to make this happen. So it's working the way it should, the way we envision it, and we're off and running. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. Good to see that there. And maybe following up on putting the dollars to work with regards to the Energize365 CapEx plan. Could you walk through the clean energy part a little bit more within the overall plan? And just wondering how that breaks down between solar energy efficiency, EV infrastructure, energy storage, different initiatives and how you see the timeline for that unfolding? And where could that go over time, I guess? Brian Tierney : So a lot of it Jeremy, is some things that we're doing on the wire side to enable the energy transition. So you've seen 2 major pieces of that. One was the PJM Open Window 3. We're able to put $800 million to work. And the other is the New Jersey offshore wind transmission component where we're putting over $700 million to work. So significant components well over $1 billion in those initiatives, in addition to what we're doing with solar generation in the state of West Virginia on our way to rounding out a 50-megawatt commitment that we have there and would like to see 2 more of those 50-megawatt commitments as we get further subscriptions.  But a lot of it rather than being on the generation side is really on the wires component of the business, and that's where the bulk of that $26 billion spend is going to be. K. Taylor: Yes, Jeremy, I'd just would add on a little bit. If you just look at the clean energy component of the $26 billion, it's a little less than 10% of the total portfolio. And like Brian said, a lot of that is in the state of West Virginia with the expected build-out of additional solar as well as the energy efficiency investments that we need to make in New Jersey to hit the state-required goals on consumption usage.  So we're working through that program right now as we speak. And we should have clarity, I think, later this year on the energy efficiency CapEx in New Jersey sometime later this year. Brian Tierney : One final piece that we've gotten questions on also, Jeremy, is that the DOE GRIP program and whether or not we've made applications for that. We proposed 5 projects and 4 of them we were asked by the DOE to proceed. And they include everything like distributed energy management, AMI, grid resilience, smart grid and storage. And so about $500 million worth of projects we're moving forward with in the GRIP program and hope to get some positive results on that later this summer. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just one last one, if I could, regarding Signal Peak and recognize it's a shrinking part of the plan over time here. But I think there's just been some reports out there about BLM delays and how that impacts operations down the line there, whether it has to shut at a certain time. Just wondering any thoughts you could share with us there? K. Taylor: No disruptions in the mine that we're aware of. In fact, we have in the plan about $0.12 of earnings contribution for the year. They contributed $0.03 in the first quarter. So they're on track with their plan. So... Operator : Your next question today is coming from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just on the pension volatility, relative to what you've done so far, how good things like the proposals you've got in the Pennsylvania rate case around pension and OPEB recovery and the normalization mechanism impact the volatility levels that you see going forward? K. Taylor: Well, if we're able to successfully get the pension tracking mechanism, that goes a long way in deferring the volatility on to the balance sheet because essentially, you would be tracking to your test year expense and any changes from that point forward, both positive or negative to that would be deferred on the balance sheet. So the volatility would be significantly reduced if you're able to achieve some of those pension tracking mechanisms.  Now we've applied for that in West Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. Last year, we were unsuccessful there. We'll apply for those mechanisms in Pennsylvania and Ohio this year. But it is something that we'll continually go after even if we're not successful this year, because I think it's important for us to make sure that we manage that volatility accordingly.  I mean the other thing we did last year is we did the pension lift-out, where we looked at our former competitive business and lifted out about half of that liability at a favorable pricing, about a 95% of par, about a 5% discount, which also reduces the volatility in the pension plan by about 5%, 10%. And we plan to do another pension lift-out at some point in time either later this year or towards the end of the year. So something that we're looking at right now. Brian Tierney : Carly, the beauty of that tracking mechanism is that the regulator is never wrong, like there's always the true-up. And so we're never making more or less than what we're asking for in rates, and it's always the right amount because it's based on the numbers. So we think it has a virtue that should be appealing to the regulators and others in our cases as well. Carly Davenport : Got it. Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe just as you think about the balance sheet, are there any factors that we should be thinking about that could push the receipt of those remaining FET proceeds beyond the latter part of this year? K. Taylor: So they've already filed for application with the last co-investor and they've asked for accelerated approval. So I'm not anticipating any delay in that. So my expectation is that we should get the proceeds later this year. Operator : Next question today is coming from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Maybe back on the Ohio rate case, I was wondering, are there any new mechanisms or new capital programs that we should watch for that might come with the filling? It didn't sound like it, but anything new that you would plan to bring into this case? K. Taylor: David, no, this will be a more traditional base rate case. I mean, obviously, we have the DCR in place, which really covers most of all of the capital in the Ohio companies, specifically targeting distribution reliability enhancements. So we'll have the Grid Mod program as well. So no new capital programs in this particular proceeding. Brian Tierney : Grid Mod, which we do have a settlement in is a little over $400 million and that will allow us to get on parity with our in-state peers in that we're doing just the noncontroversial AMI implementation, which we hope to get. I just bought a house here in Akron. I've got 40-year old analog meter on my house. It would be nice to be able to have that AMI technology in place, and that's not controversial. The other component of Grid Mod II, where we hope to be able to put more capital to work is in the distribution automation. And we've asked in that case to be able to demonstrate the benefits that customers got in Grid Mod I from the distribution automation and then come back at a later date and ask to be able to advance that program further. David Arcaro : Got it. Got it. That makes sense. And then back on the topic of data centers, I was wondering how do you see the transmission opportunity growing over time in PJM? It sounds like you could be seeing greater load growth, whether it's in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Just what's the transmission CapEx upside opportunity that you're seeing? Is that growing rapidly potentially as we see data centers move to that region? Brian Tierney : Yes. So it's a great question, Dave. It's -- I'll just say this, it's a little lumpy. So as these things are coming about, we're seeing things like the PJM Open Window 3, right? That was somewhat of an unanticipated opportunity that we don't have opportunities like that in our $26 billion plan. But as they come about, they'll be incremental to that plan. And so we've seen that process play out last year. I anticipate that we'll see more processes through future open windows from PJM as they're looking to build capacity on the grid to enable the type of load growth that data centers represent.  So you've seen it concentrated, like I said before, in that Northern Virginia, Central Ohio area, and now it's branching out into other areas. And we anticipate -- we know it's moving into our service territories in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio. David Arcaro : Got it. And I guess on that, just a quick follow-up. In your conversations with these data center customers, do you have a sense of the timing of when these are coming in and trying to connect to the grid when we could see a bigger increase in the load in interconnections coming? Brian Tierney : Yes. So I'd say it's in the year's timeframe, but they're frequently getting more aggressive about wanting sooner, service, and that's all coming into things like their supply chain? Do they have the equipment necessary to put the equipment in, the cooling that they need, the generation that they need all those things. And so we have time to see it coming. But I think they're getting increasingly aggressive about wanting service sooner and quicker than what they had previously. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Gregg Orrill : Just another follow-up regarding the DCR and how you see that getting rolled into -- getting recovery around that? Is it going to be sort of along the timeline of the new ESP V? Or will it be tied to the base rate case? And how does that impact your guidance? Brian Tierney : Yes. So our anticipation is that the accounts that we're recovering in the DCR should be fully recovered in either ESP V or the base rates. And there's been some discussion about that in the staff's filing and our responses. The accounts have been fully recovered for the last 12 or so years in the ESP V, and they've been audited and deemed appropriate and approved on an annual basis.  So whether they're -- all the accounts are in ESP V or in the base rate case, we're sort of indifferent to that. But fully believe that what's been approved and recovered and invested in for the last 12 years will continue to be in either one of those venues. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Just hopefully 2 quick ones. One on the deferred prosecution agreement, is there a date in June where it expires? Or will there be an announcement or an office issue with a notice out? K. Taylor: Anthony, it's Jon. I think that's late July. It's not June. So it's late July. I think it's like the 20th or 22nd. And if we could make a filing prior to that, we'd like to be able to do that as well. Anthony, just meaning not wait until the absolute terminal date. If we've done everything we need to, to allow us to file sooner than that, we will. Anthony Crowdell : If I take that with Shar's question earlier, you mentioned to clear that potential suit out -- suit up. Are those the last 2 items of deferred prosecution agreement and that potential loss that Shar had brought up earlier? Brian Tierney : No. There's what we talked about earlier. There's the DPA, there's the securities case and then there are the audit cases in front of the Ohio Commission, which we asked if they could proceed currently and hopefully get those behind us as well. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly, the move to investment grade, was there any existing debt that maybe was triggered to a higher interest rate because you were sub-investment grade? And is there -- will that -- will those rates maybe trigger lower? And is there any significant interest savings going forward because of that? K. Taylor: Yes. So not meaningful interest savings, but with the Moody's upgrade, we had an interest rate step-up because we were sub-investment-grade. Now that's been eliminated, effective with the upgrade, although it will start with the next interest payment later this year. I think on an annual basis, that's less than $10 million. But nonetheless, I mean, it's meaningful. And then I think we also got some better pricing on the revolving credit facility by about 25 basis points.  So I mean, all those things help, they may not be material in the grand scheme of things, but it is important to us.  Anthony, there's one more that I forgot to put on the list. There's the SEC investigation that we'd like to get settled as well. Operator : Next question today is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Just a follow-up, I think it might have been Jeremy's question on Signal Peak. There's discussion about maybe being forced to shut down in 2025. Any thoughts there about how we should think about that? And if that happens, is it just a $0.12 maybe not being there? Or is there a potential for a negative EPS impact or something like that? K. Taylor: Well, so Paul, thanks for the question. As we've kind of outlined in the plan, Signal Peak was $0.12 this year, but we really had them going to a very de minimis level of earnings contribution beginning in '25 and beyond. So not significant to the plan in the grand scheme of things. And I don't think it would ever go to where we're incurring losses, but just kind of a breakeven proposition if it were to have to shut down. Paul Patterson : Okay. Awesome. And then with respect to the Grid Mod settlement, is there any potential for having additional parties sign on to that? Or are we just going to go through what, I guess, has been outlined in the procedural [indiscernible] of the hearing examiners, are we pretty much just going to go down that road, do you think? Brian Tierney : I think we're just going to go down that road, Paul. It's June 25 is when I think we're expecting to have the hearing on it. And we have a majority of the intervenors signed on to the settlement. And there's -- like there's really nothing controversial about it. It's -- we're just trying to deploy the AMI that all the other in-state peers are either at or close to 100% of, we're trying to round out and finish the remaining 2/3 of our customers on. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. And then this has been a topic that's been coming up a lot in policy circles about trying to get more grid-enhancing technologies to be deployed as opposed to the substantial build-out and all the issues that are being seen with that in terms of cost and timing and stuff. I'm just wondering how do you think about grid-enhancing technologies, and do you have any thoughts about how they might be deployed at FirstEnergy or industry-wide? Brian Tierney : Yes. So there are our responses to the GRIP, I think, are grid-enhancing technologies, grid resilient, smart grid storage, DERMS and the like. And so with the Department of Energy, we're looking to take that money that they're looking to help jump start some of those initiatives and get our fair share of those investment for the benefit of our customers. That's about $500 million of investment that we're looking to. And the Department of Energy is looking to put those dollars to work and make these pilots a reality, and we're looking to take advantage of that for the benefit of our customers.  So it's happening. The dollars are being put to work and we're trying to get our share of those dollars. Paul Patterson : Okay. But you don't expect any -- do you expect any widespread adoption of those in the near-term? Or beyond just the pilots and the DOE funding and what have you? Is there any sense -- I know it's kind of a big question, so I apologize. I guess -- I mean, do you see the -- how do you -- do you see this as -- what the potential opportunity or threat might be associated with these technologies being deployed? Brian Tierney : I don't see it as being strategically disruptive for our industry. These new technologies, it's -- I think it's best to take a crawl-walk-run approach. And you've seen that in other places in the industry, Paul, not as big of a deal for us, but things like carbon capture and sequestration, right, to do it at a plant level, I don't think has been done on a commercial scale in this country with a coal-fired power plant.  So you look at the new EPA rules, which would either call for that or retirement of the plants, I think if that rule were to go into effect, I think it would cause a lot of plants to retire because the economic technology just isn't there. Some of the things that we're proposing doing on a pilot basis, I think, are best done on a pilot basis. But I don't see any of these technologies at this point strategically disrupting our industry. Operator : Next question is coming from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Agnieszka Storozynski : So I'm just wondering, so all these additions of data centers, especially those that are reliant on renewable power assume that there's a well-functioning grid with de minimis congestion issues. That doesn't seem right to me at least. And I was starting to hear from other PJM, wires on the utilities that they might be forced to building generation assets, again, and granted not maybe the next year or 2, but in the foreseeable future.  I mean I understand that, that's a major change to a competitive power market, but those utilities think that, that might be needed for reliability reasons. Is this something you see as well, again, it seems like we're trying to manage a 24/7 load growth with intermittent resources. And I know transmission upgrades are an answer, but I'm just wondering how you see it going forward. Brian Tierney : That's a really good question, Angie. We're having more and more discussions with regulators and other companies around the issue that you identified, which we're kind of calling resource adequacy. And certainly, it's something that people are talking more and more about it. You can't just have a robust wire system. You have to have a commodity to put on the wires. And so our 5 states have sort of different stances relative to that. For us, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, we would require legislative changes. In Maryland, there's -- in Ohio, there's an opportunity to -- for utilities to own generation on a very limited basis. And of course, West Virginia is a traditional integrated resource plan state. But for the region altogether, it is an increasingly talked about issue is, will there be enough commodity to put on the wires in the face of the load growth that we're facing and the coal unit retirements that we're facing as well. So there's going to need to be a solution to it. For us, in 4 of our states, were mostly wires. I don't think we'd ever be interested in owning generation in those states on a merchant basis. But if a state were to come to us and ask us to build on a regulated basis for a long-term, I think that's something that we'd consider. But I don't think any of our states are near that point right now. Agnieszka Storozynski : And then changing topics on interest rates. So we're starting to hear from some of the utilities that they were counting on some tailwinds from interest rates in the back half of the year. I mean that might still happen. But just wondering how do you see your growth plans and your financing plans and especially from an EPS perspective, if we -- if this current interest rate environment were to persist beyond this year? K. Taylor: Yes, Angie, so in our plan for this year, the planned coupon rate for all new debt deals was 5.75%. And then we had it elevated through the planning period over the 5 years. And so it is something that we'll keep an eye on. If you look at the 2 bond deals that we've done this year, it's on a blended basis, it's right at 5.75%. So we feel good about that, and I think we'll just have to keep an eye on interest rates. Operator : We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, Irene. Irene Prezelj : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's second quarter 2024 earnings review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. Today, I will review our financial performance and highlights for the second quarter as well as our progress executing business plan. I will also provide updates on recent regulatory and legacy issue developments, discuss trends we are seeing in the industry and review the value proposition we offer our shareholders. Looking at our second quarter results, GAAP earnings were $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.41 per share last year. We recorded a number of special items that impacted second quarter GAAP results, which Jon will address in a few minutes. Operating earnings for the quarter were $0.56 per share versus $0.47 per share last year, an increase of 19%, positively impacting second quarter operating earnings were rate adjustments and associated investments to better serve our customers. Customer demand was also a positive impact for the quarter with weather adjusted residential and commercial sales up 4% and 7%, respectively. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher planned operations and maintenance expenses and expected dilution from the 30% sale of FET. The items driving growth for the quarter point to the expected trend of improving utility earnings quality. Our capital investments to improve the customer experience increased 22% for the first six months of the year. This is reflective of our improved balance sheet that enables our Energized365 capital plan. We are executing well in 2024 and are on track to achieve the goals we've outlined. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 per share to $2.81 per share. We are reaffirming our 2024 CapEx plan of $4.3 billion versus $3.7 billion in 2023, and we are reaffirming our 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth rate. June 1st marked my one-year anniversary with FirstEnergy. Our employees have made a significant amount of progress in the last year, positioning the company for success. From an operations standpoint, we have organized FirstEnergy into four new segments, representing our five major businesses. We have restructured the company into a strong operating company model and recruited external and promoted internal executives to lead these businesses. These changes put leadership, responsibility and decision-making closer to the customer. We are investing in our people by engaging with our unions to enact mid-cycle pay adjustments to help ensure we are paying competitive wages to our representative workforce. We started an effort to hire journey level line workers to better serve our customers, and we are forming a new apprenticeship program to further support a skilled and well-trained workforce to serve our customers going forward. Regarding capital investment, we initiated our new five-year $26 billion capital investment program, Energize365 to enable the energy transition and improve reliability and the customer experience. Energize365 represents a 44% increase in investment over our previous five-year plan. On the regulatory front, we concluded constructive regulatory engagements in Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia, representing 35% of FirstEnergy's rate base. In Ohio, we currently have three traditional rate proceedings in flight. We received a constructive order in May for our ESP V case, but one that left a number of unresolved issues. We have asked for rehearing on those issues and are seeking to obtain more clarity during this phase. We filed a partial settlement agreement in our Grid Mod II case in April, focused on deploying automated meters for all of our customers. Hearings concluded on this non-controversial issue on July 2, and we are anticipating an order in the fourth quarter. We filed our base rate case in late May, requesting a 10.8% ROE and an average equity ratio of approximately 55%. We will be updating that filing today to reflect changes from the ESP V order and other updates. We expect this case to continue well into 2025. In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in early April, requesting a $502 million rate adjustment including an 11.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 53.8%. As is customary in Pennsylvania, we will engage with intervening parties in an effort to reach a settlement prior to the scheduled hearings in mid-August. New rates are expected to be effective January 1, 2025. Also in Pennsylvania, we filed our long-term Infrastructure Investment Plan 3 on July 22. This five-year plan will result in approximately $1.6 billion in investments to support enhanced reliability. The proposed LTIP 3 is about twice the investment of prior plan and demonstrates our ability to invest our strong balance sheet for the benefit of our customers. Finally, in New Jersey, we are currently in settlement discussions for Energize New Jersey plan, which was filed in November and updated in February. This is a $935 million plan designed to upgrade Jersey Central Power & Light Electric Grid infrastructure, using modern technology and smart devices to help reduce the size and duration of outages. We are currently in settlement discussions and hope to reach a constructive outcome. From a financial standpoint, the strides FirstEnergy made over the past year to improve its balance sheet were nothing short of remarkable. On March 25, the company closed its transaction to sell 30% of FET. This was the final transaction of a multiyear $7 billion equity raise that has transformed future prospects of the company. On July 17, the company received the last $1.2 billion of the $3.5 billion sale. This cash has been used to pay down short- and long-term debt and reequitize our operating companies. Rating agencies have taken notice with all three rating FirstEnergy Corp.'s senior unsecured rating as investment grade and S&P and Fitch retaining positive outlooks. Last week, S&P increased FET's senior unsecured rating from BBB- to BBB+ and retained its positive outlook. This two-notch upgrade reflects FET's enhancements in liquidity, governance and cash management practices and places FET's senior unsecured credit rating at or above the rings of our fully regulated utilities. This significantly strengthened balance sheet represents a major transformation for FirstEnergy, as well as a significant differentiator from many of our peers. It is on the basis this balance sheet that we were able to introduce Energize365 and make the investments needed to enable the energy transition and improve reliability and the customer experience. Many of our peers still have to raise significant amount have of equity to continue to grow or we'll have to issue large debt volumes higher rates. FirstEnergy does not have to do either. The balance sheet component of our transformation is complete. We are now focused on executing our operating and regulatory plans for the benefit of our customers. Turning to Slide 9, let's talk about data centers. We are getting a fair number of load study requests from data center developers across our service area. Large load studies for this type of development have more than doubled from last year. We are fortunate that in much of our service territory, we have excess transmission capacity to serve this and other economic development priorities. This capacity comes from previous manufacturing processing and generating facilities. We are also participating in the PJM open windows related to data center and other load growth. We were successful last year in the Window 3 RTEP solicitation process, and we'll be submitting proposals for the current one. Generation resource adequacy has become a very hot topic over the past year. It appears that load growth and baseload generating retirements could outpace dispatchable generating resource additions. You know in four of our five states, we are wires-only utilities. We are working with customers, states and other interested parties to help ensure there is adequate capacity to meet growing load and enable the energy transition. Finally, regarding potential retail tariff changes, we are reviewing our current tariffs and think there is enough flexibility to us to negotiate terms for us to serve new loads and at the same time, maintain existing customer protections. We need to be able to serve all loads affordably. If we find the need for future tariff adjustments, we will file them on a state-by-state basis. During the second quarter, we made significant progress resolving legacy issues. On July 21st, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio, filed a status report confirming that FirstEnergy successfully completed the obligations, it was required to perform for a three-year period under the deferred prosecution agreement, including remediation measures and the implementation of a compliance and ethics program. As a result, the report requirements related to those obligations have ended. As provided under the DPA, we will continue to fully cooperate with the DOJ on other outstanding matters, and we will continue other reporting obligations. This was an important step as we put the past behind us and move forward as a stronger company with the robust culture of ethics, integrity and compliance. We have reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff subject to the approval of commission which would settle the SEC security claims against FirstEnergy. The proposed settlement is based on the fact set forth in DPA. We have recorded a reserve of $100 million for this settlement. Similarly, we are in the final stages of a resolution with the Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission. The resolution is expected to include a non-prosecution agreement based on the facts and the DPA and is expected to resolve the Ohio Attorney General Civil Case against FirstEnergy. We have recorded a reserve of $19.5 million in anticipation resolving both Ohio matters. The three docketed cases related to these legacy issues continue to move forward at the PUCO. An audit report is due on August 28 on the political and charitable spending review. Discovery continues and hearing is scheduled for October 9 on the corporate separation review. Discovery is ongoing with a here scheduled for February 3 on the Rider DMR/DCR audit. We continue to cooperate in these audits and appreciate that these cases are the appropriate form for a review of this activity and not our business as usual rate cases. Let's take a moment to review FirstEnergy's value proposition to shareholders. Our 6% to 8% operating earnings growth rate is predicated on an average annual growth in rate base of 9%. Our ability to invest in our system for the benefit of our customers as enabled by strong balance sheet. We have the need, opportunity and means to make the necessary investments to enable the energy transition and improve reliability and the customer experience. FirstEnergy has an attractive low-risk profile that supports solid BBB credit metrics. We are targeting a 14% to 15% FFO to debt profile over the horizon and do not anticipate incremental equity needs for our Energize365 investment plan beyond our employee benefit programs. The increase of traditional utility earnings means that our earnings quality has improved and our customer affordability is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Our long-term annual operating earnings growth rate combined with our dividend, represent a total shareholder return proposition of 10% to 12%. We have made significant progress on strengthening our balance sheet, restructuring our business putting legacy issues behind us and focusing on our operational, regulatory financial plans. The men and women of FirstEnergy are singularly focused on that execution and serving our customers. Before I turn the call over to Jon, I would like to mark 2 significant management transitions for FirstEnergy. Two executives have recently notified me of their decision to retire after many years of service to the company. Chris Walker, our Chief Human Resources Officer, will be retiring with nearly 39 years of service. I would like to thank Chris personally for all she has done for me over the past year, and also thank her for her many years of dedicated service on behalf of our employees. We owe Chris ahead of gratitude and wish her well in retirement. After more than 40 years of service, Irene Prezelj has decided to retire. Many of you have gotten to know Irene, as our Head of Investor Relations and Commissions. For many years, Irene has been the face of the company to investors in the public alike. We are grateful to Irene for her leadership and dedication to serving our employees, investors, customers and the public. We wish her the best going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I also want to extend my sincere gratitude and best wishes to Chris and Irene. They have been great to work with over the years and have always been there for me and the employees of the company. I wish them every bit of happiness in their retirement. Today, I'll review our financial performance, discuss economic and customer trends and provide an update on our regulatory and financial initiatives. Let's start by reviewing the larger special items that impacted our second quarter GAAP results. These include increased asset retirement obligations recognized in connection with the planned transfer of a legacy impoundment site to a third-party and the impact from the new EPA legacy coal combustion residuals rule. Costs associated with redeeming high-cost debt using the proceeds from the FET transaction, charges connected to the anticipated resolution of the OOCIC and SEC investigations, partially offset by the receipt of insurance proceeds associated with the shareholder derivative lawsuit settlement and regulatory charges resulting from a commitment in the Ohio ESP V order. We continue to see strong execution on our Energize365 capital investment program, solid financial discipline and a culture of continuous improvement. And because of that, we delivered second quarter operating earnings of $0.56 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance and compares to $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The results primarily reflect new base rates in our integrated business, strong invested capital across all of our businesses and formula rate investment programs and significantly higher year-over-year customer demand. Looking at our segment results for the quarter, in our distribution business, operating earnings were $0.22 per share compared to $0.24 per share in the second quarter of last year. This reflects planned increases in operating expenses we discussed previously, partially offset by higher customer demand and rate base growth rate investment programs and a lower customer rate credit in Ohio as part of our 2021 earnings test settlement. In our Integrated segment, operating earnings were $0.21 per share versus $0.12 per share in the second quarter of last year. Results primarily reflect new base rates in Maryland, West Virginia and New Jersey that went into effect over the past 8 months. Rate base growth in distribution and transmission formula rate investment programs and the impact of higher customer demand, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Operating earnings in our stand-alone transmission segment were $0.14 per share compared to $0.18 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Year-over-year rate base increased more than 10% as a result of our transmission investment program, but this was offset by the dilution from the 30% interest sale of FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield, which closed in March of this year. Finally, in our Corporate, segment losses were $0.01 per share versus $0.07 per share in the second quarter of 2023. This improvement is the result of ongoing lower financing costs from the redemption high-cost debt. More detail on our second quarter and year-to-date results can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website yesterday afternoon. Looking ahead, we are providing guidance of $0.85 $0.95 per share for the third quarter, which reflects the continued impacts of new base rates in our integrated business, continued rate base growth and higher customer demand, partially offset by a lower planned earnings contribution from Signal Peak. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $2.61 to $2.81 per share as well our long-term 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate. In his remarks, Brian shared a look at the trends related to data center growth in our service territory. I want to expand on that by taking a quick look at some of the broader economic and load activity in our region. Recent trends over the past year are positive in our region, including GDP that has averaged just over 2% for the past year, and employment growth of just under 1.5% over the past 12 months. And from a customer demand perspective, we're seeing positive weather-adjusted customer demand of 1% over the last 12 months, primarily resulting from increases of 1.3% in the commercial and 1.1% in the industrial customer classes with demand in the auto and services sectors, up 14% and 7%, respectively. And so we believe we're in a great position to serve our customers and our investment program will adjust as needed to ensure capacity and reliable service. From a financing plan perspective, earlier this month, we received the remaining $1.2 billion in proceeds from the $3.5 billion, 30% FET interest sale to Brookfield. You'll recall that we received the initial proceeds of $2.3 billion when the transaction closed in March, the remaining $1.2 billion in interest-bearing notes that were extinguished with Brookfield's final payment on July 17. We're deploying those proceeds in a credit accretive manner, consistent with our plan to further transform our balance sheet and support our Energize365 grid investment program. As we've discussed, the sale completes a series of transactions over the last two and half years that resulted in nearly $7 billion in equity capital at an equivalent share price of $87 a share or 36 times trailing PE multiple. In total, these proceeds were used for over $3 billion in high-cost debt reductions at FE Corp, including the remaining $460 million of the 2031 bonds in the second quarter, nearly $2 billion in utility long-term debt redemptions and $2 billion to pay off short-term debt that would have otherwise been financed with long-term debt at our utilities. Following the closing of this transaction in March, our corporate credit rating was upgraded by Moody's and S&P, restoring it to investment grade at all three rating agencies. The credit ratings at our subsidiaries were also upgraded and this momentum continued last week as S&P further upgraded FET and its subsidiaries. Going forward, our focus is on continued execution of our plan, achieving cross-supportive regulatory outcomes, moving past legacy issues and financing our robust investment plan in a credit-supportive manner, consistent with a BBB flat credit profile. Additionally, earlier this month, we launched a request for proposal for a second pension lift-out transaction to eliminate the remaining $700 million in non-regulated pension liability. This transaction is successful would eliminate all non-regulated pension liability, further reduce pension volatility and improve the quality of earnings of the company. Recall that in December of last year, we executed the first pension lift-out transaction, removing approximately $720 million of pension liability at $0.95 on the dollar. Turning now to recent regulatory activity. In Ohio, we filed our base rate review on May 31, request was for a $94 million rate adjustment on rate base of $4.3 billion, a 10.8% proposed on equity and a 55% equity capitalization ratio based on a 2024 test year. The rate adjustment supports recovery investments in the distribution system and customer experience enhancements, while keeping rates affordable for customers. The case includes recovery of investments in Riders DCR and AMI, which includes the Grid Mod I capital investments in base rates and resetting those riders to zero. It also includes a request to change the recovery of pension costs from service cost only to total pension costs, including previously incurred actuarial losses as well as a request for pension tracking mechanism to avoid volatility in the future. And it includes recovery of other costs previously incurred, including the major storm restoration costs and a program to convert street lights LEDs. Today, the Ohio companies will file an update to the base rate case review filing with an updated rate request. The update is necessary to include the impacts addressed in the May 15 ESP V order and to update 2024 test year financial information through May 31st to reflect actual operating results. Our initial request represents an estimated overall bill impact for typical residential customers ranging from a rate decrease of 1.3% in Toledo Edison to a 3.5% increase in CEI or an average increase of 1.4% across Ohio. Also in Ohio, on May 15th, the PUCO issued an order approving our ESP V with modifications, which became effective June 1st. The order extended Rider DCR through the conclusion of the base rate case, but excluded certain investments from recovery in Rider DCR. The order also provided for recovery of vegetation management expenses for the first two years the ESP and prospective deferral of major storm expenses. While we appreciate the support for key terms of our ESP V in the near-term, the order did not provide clarity regarding these key terms of the ESP for entire five-year period. With many directed to the base rate case for resolution. We subsequently filed an application for rehearing seeking greater certainty regarding key terms as well as proposed modifications, which included shortening the ESP V term to three years, providing full recovery of investments in the DCR through the conclusion of the base rate case and other proposals that preserve the economic value of the order for customers. Earlier this month, the PUCO granted the applications for rehearing filed by all parties for the purposes of further consideration. This step gives the PUCO more time to make its final decision, there\u2019s no statutory deadline for the decision. The summer hearings were held in our Ohio Grid Mod II settlement, and we anticipate an order during the fourth quarter. In Pennsylvania, earlier this month, we filed the third phase of our long-term infrastructure improvement plan known as LTIP III, which is part of our Energize365 investment program. LTIP III includes a total projected investments of $1.6 billion over five years, building on the projects completed in LTIP I and LTIP II, the third phase of the program supplements reliability investments and includes both grid modernization and system resiliency projects. This includes targeted investments to accelerate infrastructure improvements and help enhance service reliability for more than two million customers in the state, while remaining focused on affordability. Investments are recovered through a distribution system improvement charge, or DISC based on actual capital structure and the benchmark ROE, which is currently 9.8%. The cumulative average residential customer rate impact recovered through DISC is $2.88 or a 2% increase. Pending PUCO approval, we expect capital deployment to begin in the first quarter of 2025 with DISC revenues estimated to begin in the second quarter of 2026. Also in Pennsylvania, in mid-August, hearings will begin in our base rate review filed in April. As we discussed on quarter's call, this is a request for a $502 million rate adjustment on rate base of $7.2 billion, with an 11.3% proposed return on equity and a 53.8% equity capitalization ratio. The review built on our service liability enhancements in Pennsylvania with additional investments in a smart, modern electric grid and customer-focused programs, while keeping rates comparable to other utilities in the state. Key components include implementing a 10-year enhanced vegetation management program to reduce tree-caused outages, reduced outage restoration time and reduce future maintenance costs; recovery of costs associated with major storms, COVID-19 and LED street light conversions; changing pension recovery from average cash contributions to traditional pension expense, including previously recognized actuarial losses. The review also includes a blended federal statutory tax rate of approximately 27%, but also continues to provide customer savings from previous legislative changes to federal and state tax rates. Additionally, the application proposes a pension OPEB normalization mechanism to track and defer differences between actual and test year expense to reduce volatility from the pension. And as Brian mentioned, we are engaging with the intervening parties in an effort to reach settlement prior to the scheduled hearings in mid-August. Finally, in addition to the settlement discussions on our Energize New Jersey infrastructure improvement proposal, we are also engaged in settlement discussions for our New Jersey Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan. This plan, which was filed with the BPU in December 2023, covers the period from January 1st, 2025, through June 30th, 2027, with a proposed budget of approximately $964 million. It consists of a portfolio of programs addressing energy efficiency, peak demand reduction, and building decarbonization with recovery of lost revenues and provides a return on the investments. The BPU suspended the procedural schedule July 1st in light of these settlement discussions. A final BPU decision and order is required no later than October 15th of this year. So, we're making good progress in 2024, we're executing well. We have a strong strategy and opportunities to continue our positive momentum and growth. Thank you for your time today, and I'll open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys. Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning Brian. Just a couple of quick ones here. Brian, just on the growth numbers out there, obviously, you're highlighting the opportunities around data centers and kind of large energy-intensive consumers, you have transmission capacity to take on the load, but you still have this kind of 1% load growth figure out there. A lot of your peers have been raising expectations, some are quantifying the impact. I guess, what's holding back? And how and when are you thinking about updating investors around potential upside there? Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thank you for that, Shar. We're going through our evaluation of our future load growth rate right now. Look, we're seeing some things that are positive from the data center side. Some of those still a few years out. We're seeing some positive impacts from adoption of EVs in places like Maryland and New Jersey. But overall, we're still seeing modest, steady low growth and not it knock out of the park at this point. There's been so much talk about data center, Shar. And when we look at it, even if we get the load growth, they're generally taking service at a transmission level, which isn't as earnings impactful. Today, it could be rate impactful in a positive way to our existing customers as we spread some of that existing capacity over more units. But the real opportunity for us around data centers has been around things like the PJM Open Window 3, where we were awarded about $800 million worth of opportunity to invest in the transmission system to serve some of that data center load that's that Northern Virginia, Panhandle, Maryland area. So that's where we've seen more impact from the data centers, but more to be seen, and I anticipate probably around EEI, we'll be able to update you on the load growth. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then lastly and maybe somewhat related. It's been noise around sort of co-located nuclear data center deals in PJM. I mean some of your current states like in Pennsylvania and Ohio could see similar deals like we saw with Susquehanna and AWS. I guess, why haven't you filed at FERC around the Susquehanna ISA docket when most of your peers have? And what's stance on the current complaint out there? Thanks. Brian Tierney : Yes. So thank you for that question. Look, I think those are things that FERC will figure out in time. It's not as business impactful to us at this point, given our service territory and where we are. And I'm interested in what FERC has to say about that. I'm not sure what their tools are to be able to block something like that, what their view is on whether or not it takes net capacity out of the market and what that would do for existing customers. We just saw some pretty high prints on the PJM capacity auction yesterday. I think people are looking to that mechanism to solve generation resource adequacy. I'm not sure it really does, right? That's one print in that auction that happened yesterday. There was virtually no new generating capacity was offered and I don't think that a one-year print or a two-year print or a three-year print is going to solve that problem and attract significant increased investment into the PJM region. So something we need to figure out. It's important for our customers. We're actively engaged in that discussion. But I don't think the PJM auction is the place where that issue is going to be solved. Shar Pourreza : Got it, Brian. And just a quick follow-up on that. Are you referring to potentially owning a certain amount of peaking assets and rates? Is that what the discussions are? Brian Tierney : So the issue is how could we help that happen. And in certain of our states today, we're not allowed to own capacity. In West Virginia, we do in Maryland under circumstances we could in Ohio under certain circumstances we could. But in other states, we'd have to have legal challenges to allow that to happen. And if our states were to come to us and say, we would like you to invest in some form of dispatchable generation for the life of the asset at a regulated return. Those are things that we think would benefit our customers. If other people aren't adding the capacity and today, they're not. And those are discussions that we think would be constructive on behalf of our customers. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. Fantastic. Guys, we will see you soon. Thank you again. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Shahriar. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. First, I don't know if Irene started working there when she was 10 years old, but congrats to Irene on 40 years and her retirement. I guess, first question, just on Pennsylvania, you mentioned you're getting close to settlement actions there. Just any sense yet on kind of the likelihood that you might be able to reach a settlement in Pennsylvania? Brian Tierney : So thanks for that, Steve. Those talks are in early discussions. And it's we would always like to reach a settlement and present that to the commission, but I'd say early stages at this point, and we're optimistic that we'll be able to get something done hopefully before the hearings in August. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just on the -- going to Ohio on the ESP V, I guess, the benefit you're seeking to kind of keep it shorter period, it sounds like the benefit of that is that you'll have less time to kind of just be there with an ESP with this limited definition? Or do you really want to just get better definition over the life of the ESP of some these clauses? Brian Tierney : Here's what happened, the commission punted some key aspects of ESP V to the base rate case. And so it's hard for us to accept a five-year plan when there's uncertainty beyond the current rate case. And so if we were to time those things up a little better, and get more certainty on it, it's easier for us to accept an ESP V over a five-year term with more certainty. It's really hard for us to know what's going to happen to certain of those items that got punted after we get resolution of the base rate case. Steve Fleishman : Got it. That's right. And then obviously, it's your decision whether to accept an ESP or not. So that's part of the\u2026 Brian Tierney : Yes. That's correct. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Okay. I know you mentioned that you are, I guess, far enough on some the Ohio issues to take a reserve on those this quarter. Just maybe you could just talk to and then resolving the DPA 2 period. So just could you maybe just talk to kind of your overall take on the environment there and how FirstEnergy is viewed these days? Paul Patterson : Yeah. So thank you for that, Steve. Look, we've worked very, very hard to take responsibility for what happened in the past, make any payment and penalties that we need to move on beyond that. The thing that was very positive this quarter was in three of those issues, we made some real significant progress. First, there was the filing by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio recognizing that the three-year term of the DPA had ended and that we've been fully compliant with the requirements during that term. Second, we were able to make progress on the OOCIC and we were able to take a reserve for the amount that we think will be required to put that behind us. And then third, we were able to make progress achieving an agreement in principle subject to commission approval with the SEC. So across all fronts, we're making real progress on putting those legacy issues behind us and focusing on future. And I think, it's being well received in all of those venues. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to follow up a little bit more on some of the earlier points on power prices here. And given the rise in both capacity and energy prices, just wondering, how you think about this impacts customers build headroom there. And just, do you see any potential efforts out there to kind of curb this? Could you share any thoughts on potential for state legislation to support new generation, state to form a strategic reserve, multiple VIUs coming together for a larger consolidated IRP, greater FRR use? Or just in general, do you see anything happening to stem higher prices? Brian Tierney : Jeremy, you use just about every acronym we have in the industry in that question. That was amazing. Here are some of the things that we're doing right now, right? It was late breaking news yesterday afternoon. So we're going by a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis of the impact of a couple of things. One is the higher capacity print that we saw yesterday. But we also still have some energy prices in there that are reflective of the Ukrainian impact on gas prices and electricity in the United States and some of those are rolling off, at the same time, those higher capacity prices will be rolling in. So we're trying to determine right now on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, how that will happen and what the impact to our customers will be. In West Virginia, we think the impact will be kind of a wash. We have about the amount of capacity that our West Virginia customers need and buying and selling at those amounts, we don't expect there to be a significant impact in the state of West Virginia. As we look forward to the other states, right, we have, what I would say, among most progressive energy policy states in the country and among the most traditional as well. So I think West Virginia has traditionally been responsive to being pro-coal, but also all of the above. We've added some solar there recently. And I'd like to see if in our next IRP, we might be able to add some combined cycle gas in West Virginia in addition to that. And then in some of the other states where we're wires only, we're open to any construct that would allow us to invest in capacity on something that looks like a regulated basis. So, if we were to have in Pennsylvania and Ohio, something that looked like NYSERDA or NYPA, where a state agency could buy at long-term capacity that they might hold an auction for that anyone competitive generators, regulated generators could offer into that, those auctions. If it looked like a regulated basis and we could offer at a price that would allow us something that looked like a regulated return and allow us to recover on a pass-through basis, fuel and energy, those are things that we'd be willing to do. The thing we wouldn't be willing to do would be start competitive generation of our own. That's something that we've recently come out of. We paid a heavy price for that. We've rebuilt our balance sheet in the wake of that, and that's not a place that we're going to be going back to. But other things, other opportunities that could benefit our customers have the capacity that they need be responsive from a price standpoint are all things that are on the table and are all things we're talking to our states about. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's clear. competitive generation been there, done that. Just wanted to pivot a bit here, a smaller question. Just wondering, if you could speak to the size of cost savings that you guys are expecting with some of the facility optimization moves you're making, shrinking, changing location, just where those initiatives stand today? And what can we expect for timing impact of that and other kind of cost saving initiatives on radar? Jon Taylor : Hi, Jeremy, it's Jon. I think we'll see some savings associated with, for instance, getting out of the general office headquarters here in Akron moving over to an owned building. But those savings, I would say, are fairly minimal in the grand scheme of things. Where we're really trying to focus our efforts on continuous improvement and taking cost out of the business is really around our productivity of workforce, investing in infrastructure and data and technology that will help us drive better decision-making, faster decision-making. And we have some pretty aggressive targets on productivity of our workforce, so we can make sure that we get contractors off the property that we do our work ourselves. That's where the bulk of the savings are coming from. And in fact, if you look over the last couple of years, we've done a pretty nice job of taking cost out with about $200 million of cost savings in 2023. About $100 million of that was sustainable, and we're targeting $70 of cost savings this year. So we'll continue to do what we can to offset inflation going forward, and that's part of our plan. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. I forgot to mention with my earlier question, as far as offshore wind is concerned, is that anything that on your radar at all or really just kind of the transmission side? I just wanted to check on that. Brian Tierney : I'll tell you what our favorite part of offshore wind is, it's the on-land part. And we are investing a significant amount of money to shore up the transmission system in New Jersey to enable their initiatives to have significant offshore wind commissure in our service territory, and we're making hundreds of millions of dollars of investments to enable that, and that's the part of offshore wind that we want to participate in. Jeremy Tonet : Understood. Appreciate it. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks Jeremy. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I know a lot of talk on PJM. Just I wanted to follow-up on that, Brian, I know you said that one print is not a signal, but we'll have another one in December. And my guess is that not much changes just given the lead times to build this generation. And I guess my question is, is there a tipping point if this is kind of truly a step change in the environment, is there any need to reevaluate how you deploy capital? Or you being very comfortable where you are right now? Thanks. Brian Tierney : Look, thank you for the question, Nick. Look, I think it's interesting. I'd call yesterday's print, the canary in the coal mine and the canary didn't make it. If you look at what's happened with the IPP prices over the course of the year, they are all anticipating higher prices in the years going forward. If you look at the amount of new generation that cleared in the auction yesterday, according to PJM's auction report, it was like 100 megawatts, so essentially nil. Same in the auction prior to that, it was about 300 megawatts, again, not the right amount. If people were to respond to yesterday's print and say, yes, I think it's a good idea to invest in baseload dispatchable generation PJM, it would be six years before that capacity would come online. The reality is that we can increase load and build data centers almost immediately and it takes years of planning, permitting and procuring and construction to build a power plant. So I think it's indicative of the future, but it certainly doesn't solve the problem. So what we're going to do is what we need to do is enable the energy transmission you need a robust grid to be able to do that. PJM keeps opening these open windows. There's a current one open that we will be submitting proposals to. We just had significant action that we won in the last one, and we'll continue to do that. And we're going to engage in the discussion constructively with our states, regulators and customers to see if there's a way that we could deploy our balance sheet capacity for generation that looked regulated like to us and our investors. But that's how we're viewing the lay of the land right now. I don't have the silver bullet. That's the solution that will solve this tomorrow or in two years or in three years, but we're engaged in that discussion. I just don't think the PJM construct is going to fix the issue even if it sends some positive price signals. Nick Campanella : I really appreciate your thoughts on all that. And then you brought up the balance sheet capacity. And one thing that we've noticed is, obviously, you've done a great job derisking the balance sheet this year. You're really not relying much on capital markets this year either. And I know you kind of are working towards another update maybe in the fall or later in the year. Just as you roll forward, presumably the CapEx plan is pressure higher? And how are you kind of thinking about financing that? Is this a plan that kind of continues to have sizable balance sheet capacity where we see no equity on a roll forward? Thank you. Jon Taylor : Hey, Nick, this is Jon. So we'll work through that as we do our long-term plan and update the investment community and spring time or winter time of next year. I would tell you, listen, we got to balance a couple of different things. We want to be at a BBB flat credit rating with rating agencies were not there yet. If you look at where their thresholds are versus where our planned targets are, we do have some balance sheet capacity, I would say 4% of the CapEx program is probably in right neighborhood. But there's going to be a lot of puts and takes as we think about the capital plan over the next five to 10 years that we'll have to consider. Is it base capital that you'll have regulatory lag? Or is it formula rate transmission capital, those are all things that are going to go into the mix. But we do have some balance sheet capacity, but I would probably peg it at less than 5% of the CapEx program. Nick Campanella : That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that. Have a great day. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Carly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Just like to quickly go back to the load growth piece. Strong prints across both commercial and residential customer classes this quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about what's driving that and kind of how you see that evolving going forward? Jon Taylor : Yeah, Carly, let me start with residential. I mean we're just generally seeing at least this quarter higher average usage per customer across all of our jurisdictions, especially in areas like New Jersey and Maryland, which have a much more progressive energy policy with respect to electrification of electrification of vehicles or other industries. We also continue to see higher customer growth in Maryland, given some of the economic activity that we're seeing in that part of our service territory. So that's really what's driving the residential growth for the quarter. If you look at commercial and commercial for us is kind of our small- and medium-sized businesses. This is a customer class that took a pretty hard hit after the COVID pandemic. We saw a pretty significant drop-off. And now we're starting to see some of that rebound. And if you look at the last four quarters, three of the four have been higher quarter-over-quarter, and it's getting closer to what I would call pre-pandemic level usage. So those are really what are the drivers for the residential and commercial prints for the quarter. Carly Davenport : Great. Appreciate that. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Carly. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Lonegan with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lonegan : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in the Ohio rate case, obviously, it's early on, but just wondering if you see an opportunity for ultimately reaching a settlement there. You reached a partial settlement in Grid Mod this year, a settlement with the House Rule 6 refunds credits a few years ago. Now you're resolving some of the legacy issues in the state. But that being said, ESP V, there are some issues with that. So just wondering what your thoughts are about ultimating settlement there. Brian Tierney : Michael, it's always our desire to reach a settlement in any of these rate cases. This one is something that I think is very much at its early stages. We'll be filing our update to the rate case filing later today. And then, of course, we'll be engaging with interveners and other interested parties as we work our way through the balance of 2024 and well into 2025. So yes, always want to reach a settlement, always open to that and always striving to do that in any case that we find. Michael Lonegan : Got it. Great. And then secondly for me, obviously, the big CapEx increase earlier this year, the 44%, an expectation is that you'll file more regular rate cases. Obviously, you have the two big ones going on in Ohio and Pennsylvania right now, and you recently reached settlement in your other states. Just wondering how we should think about the jurisdictions and timings of your next rate cases. Brian Tierney : Yes. So thank you for that as well, Mike. Look, I have the belief that a well-run and growing utility should be going in for regular rate cases. We have a strong balance sheet. We have Energize365, the CapEx plant we're pursuing. By the way, we have a significant amount of our capital is covered under riders and trackers. But I think a very regular interaction with our regulators is something that we should be doing regularly. So I think in most jurisdictions, we should be going in every two to three years at the max and updating rates clearing out trackers and riders, getting them reflected in base rates and then moving forward with those again. So I just think it's a hallmark of a growing utility that you should be regularly engaging with your regulators. Michael Lonegan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning Paul. Paul Patterson : I wanted to echo what Steve's -- congratulations to Irene first of all. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just sort of back to the -- sort of regulated or sort of central procurement ideas that you were throwing out there. I'm just wondering what jurisdictions in your distribution-only service territories do you think are more receptive to that that idea than others? Sometimes those logical issues would have you, I mean, for whatever reason, some might be as logical as something might be some might be a little bit more resistant or a little bit more receptive than others. I was just thinking any thoughts about in your discussion about who might be a little bit more open to that idea? Brian Tierney : Yes. So, Paul, you asked a politically-fraught question. Look, I think the real need here in the near-term is for baseload dispatchable generation. And we are ready, willing and able to engage in all of our jurisdictions for anyone who would like to add that on a regulated type basis. West Virginia has really said to us that coal is important to them, but everything should be in the tool bag in West Virginia, we're willing to engage with them on that basis. Maryland and Ohio under certain circumstances, we could add generation there, and Pennsylvania would take a legislative change. So, we are open to all. And if they're open to us, we'd be willing to engage on that regulated type basis. And again, there are people that get upset and say, you're going back to regulation. I don't think you have to go back to regulation. I think you can still have energy markets. I think you can still have retail choice where you have it today. But I also think you could have constructs like NYSERDA or NYPA where they could buy on behalf of the state's residents. And that doesn't have to be an end to competition. And they can even have auctions where all people could participate in that, utilities, independent power producers, and others. So, for the people that say it has to be one or the other, I just don't think that's a valid premise. Paul Patterson : Great. Thanks a lot. Have a great one. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Paul. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Hi good morning. I want to also congratulate Irene on an incredible career and Chris, I don't know you, but looking at the number of new leaders who joined FE in the last year, I think you certainly deserve congratulations as well. Brian Tierney : Thank you for that. I'll pass that on. Andrew Weisel : Just a couple of quick ones on the balance sheet. I know you're targeting 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt, consistent with prior guidance. Are you still on track to reach that by year end? Where does that metric stand as of June 30th after the FET proceeds? And I see you're still reiterating equity needs of up to $100 million per year, you've taken $120 of reserves. Should those turn into cash outflows, would that ultimately require incremental equity as sort of a one-timer? Or would that be able to -- or would you be able to satisfy that without more equity? And I recognize the timing of that would be very uncertain, but maybe just some thoughts on that. Jon Taylor : Yes. Andrew, this is Jon. So we've made significant improvements in the metrics just -- if you look at where we are as of the trailing 6/30 numbers, close to 200 basis points of improvement, a lot of that is coming from higher FFO. But if you just look at our debt levels, they're about $2 billion below where they were this time last year. I do think we're going to be a little bit challenged this year to hit the 14%. A lot of that is because of the SEC and OOCIC accrual. If you were to back those out, we would be closer to the 14%. But longer term, we're going to be at 14% to 15%. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Does that mean by next year? Or will it... Jon Taylor : It would be next year. So sometime like in probably the first, second or third quarters of next year on a trailing basis, we would probably get to that 14% level. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Remind me, if you were to do a pension lift out, would that be cash or non-cash? Jon Taylor : Well, it would be funded through the pension plan. It would be non-cash to the company, but the pension plan would have to fund it, which would use the investments that it has on hand to fund that. Andrew Weisel : Right. Okay. But it wouldn't require external financing. Jon Taylor : No, no, no, that's right. If you think about what we did in December, eliminated a $720 million liability by paying $0.95 on the dollar through the pension plan. So, no external financing to the company. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Very good. Thank you so much. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please state with your question. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Thank you and thank you, Irene. I appreciate it. Just a couple of timing questions. Just on the potential construct of a NYSERDA type agency. What is the earliest do you think something like that could get started in any of your states? And then just on Grid Mod II, I know you've got the partial settlement there. What's your thinking on sort of the timing to get that done? What has to be done there? Brian Tierney : So let me take Grid Mod II first, Greg. Would anticipate an order in the fourth quarter of this year on the settlement that that we proposed. So hope to get done like I said, this year, and we could start making those investments right away in the AMI. On the NYSERDA, it would require legislation changes in all of our jurisdictions to make that happen. And then they would have to have a process where they would run an auction to do that. So, I'd say it's not a short-term process. It would require legislation change and then activation of that new entity to do what it needs to do on behalf of its customers. So on behalf of the residents state rather than customers. The important thing about that is, it could be a structural change that could be a path forward rather than an auction to auction, do I build, don't build? There would actually be a structure for how the state would procure its incremental needs that could survive auctions, administrations and the like, and it could be truly sustainable. And I think we need a sustainable solution here even if it's not a short-term fix. Gregg Orrill : Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Gregg. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just one quick one, Brian. You talked about the PJM contract maybe it's not going to struggle to attract new generation, canary a coal mine, all this. Do you think as we're in this period, while they're trying to figure how to incentivize new generation, that could delay the economic growth or stall the economic growth or a load that you should see in the region? Brian Tierney : I don't think so, Anthony, obviously, we have capacity to use still. I think we're still serving capacity. We're still adding load. We still have transmission capacity to serve people. I think long term, it could be a problem for economic development and load growth, and I think that's why we need to solve it. So it's not happening now. It could happen going forward. And I think on a regional and statewide basis, that's why we need to think about this. We can't cede our competitiveness to other regions because we don't have the energy to serve them. And it's our job to make sure that doesn't happen. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Anthony. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen, does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gina Caskey, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Responsibility. Please go ahead, Gina. Gina Caskey : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's third quarter 2024 earnings review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Gina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. Today, I will review our financial performance for the third quarter and discuss key strategic updates. I will also provide updates on recent regulatory developments, address critical issues in our industry and review the value proposition we offer shareholders. Looking at our third quarter results. GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $0.73 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2023. Operating earnings for the quarter were $0.85 per share compared to $0.88 in 2023, which included state tax benefits that did not repeat this year. Earnings for the quarter benefited from higher distribution sales, primarily from more normal weather versus 2023, the implementation of new base rates in our integrated segment and the impact of formula rate investments across all of our businesses. These items were primarily offset by higher storm-related expenses, dilution from the 30% sale of FirstEnergy Transmission and the absence of state tax benefits that were recognized in 2023 in our corporate segment. Our team continues to do a great job maintaining their focus on efficient operations and financial discipline, while executing against our plan. We experienced headwinds in the quarter, including significant storm expenses, some of which were not deferred for recovery. Our team responded to the headwinds, demonstrating resilience and discipline to achieve third quarter earnings within our guidance range. I'm proud of their work and I'm confident that we are building the right team and culture focused on our core values and priorities to ensure that we deliver sustainable value for our customers, communities, and shareholders. Today, we are narrowing our [Technical Difficulty] operating earnings range to [Technical Difficulty] from our previous range of $2.61 to $2.81 per share. During 2024, we were able to offset a number of financial headwinds through cost savings and focusing on capital work. In the quarter, we realized significant storm costs that did not meet the regulatory requirements for deferral. This development is leading us to make the guidance adjustment. We are reaffirming our five year CapEx plan of $26 billion through 2028 as well as our 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth rate, which is driven by average annual rate base growth of 9%. We plan to provide a more comprehensive update, including a 2025 to 2029 financial plan early next year. We've put in the foundational work to support our goals. Now we're executing against our operational, financial and regulatory plans to become a premier electric company. We'll continue to make meaningful investments that deliver value to our customers. Through the third quarter, our capital investments totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the first nine months of 2023. We are increasing our 2024 investment plan from $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion, with over 70% in formula rate investments. The enhanced 2024 investment plan reflects increased reliability investments, primarily in our distribution and stand-alone transmission businesses. We're also participating in PJM's 2024 regional transmission expansion plan, which is incremental to our $26 billion Energize365 Investment Plan. We entered into a joint development agreement with Dominion Energy Virginia and American Electric Power to propose several new regional transmission projects across multiple states within the PJM footprint. These includes several new 765-kv, 500-kv, 345-kv transmission lines in our collective service territories. We believe this collaboration will facilitate joint analysis of constraints, development of long range buildable solutions and execution of those solutions in a cost effective and timely manner, leveraging each company's strength, ranging from expertise in constructing and operating different transmission voltage systems to the use of existing corridors and community relationships will allow for higher confidence in the execution of our proposals. In September, the joint development parties collectively submitted multiple portfolios of solutions to the competitive planning process. The most comprehensive of these options totals $3.8 billion in investment. FirstEnergy also submitted nearly $1 billion of individual projects to PJM and for needs that are outside the joint development agreement. PJM staff is expected to select recommended projects by the end of the year with final approval expected at the PJM Board meeting in late February. From an operation standpoint, we're seeing great results from our new business unit structure. And yesterday, we made another key addition to our leadership team. Karen McClendon has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, effective November 11th. Karen brings to FirstEnergy more than three decades of human resources experience, most recently as the CHRO at Paychex. She will spearhead our efforts to integrate and advance our human capital strategy, ensuring alignment with our strategic vision. She will be responsible for functions, including talent management, benefits and compensation, labor and employee relations as well as our commitment to building an inclusive workforce and a workplace reflective of the communities we serve. I am pleased to welcome Karen to FirstEnergy. Our new business unit structure is driving strong performance. This summer, four of our new business unit executives recruited from inside and outside the company, took the helm at our New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and stand-alone transmission businesses. John Hawkins, President of our Pennsylvania business, led the team to craft the recent rate case settlement, demonstrating our commitment to building constructive regulatory relationships and driving results that support our customers. Torrence Hinton and Doug Mokoid led a tremendous response to challenging summer storms in Ohio and New Jersey. In New Jersey, Doug led JCP&L through 10 separate storm response events, since he came on board at the beginning of the summer. These back-to-back events had our crews and storm rotation for six consecutive weeks as they restored service to our customers. In Ohio, in historic storm on August 6th in the Cleveland area disrupted power for more than 600,000 customers. This included five confirmed tornadoes, resulting in significant damage to the electric distribution system. It was the most impactful storm to hit the Cleveland area, since 1993. Our response to this storm totaled more than $120 million and involved more than 7,500 workers, including thousands of FirstEnergy employees and contractors from 12 states. This massive restoration effort with coordination and collaboration across state and local government agencies was executed at a high level and allowed us to restore power ahead of our original targets. In Ohio, we received positive media coverage and community recognition for our storm response and our consistent, reliable communications. Coming together to help our communities is a hallmark of our industry. We're grateful for the assistance we received from outside crews, and we're proud to step in when we're needed elsewhere. More than 1,000 of our own employees and contractors were dispatched this fall to help restore power in communities devastated by hurricanes Helene and Milton. The work that these men and women do is critical to our country, and I thank them for their service. Turning to regulatory matters. In Pennsylvania, as I mentioned, John Hawkins led the effort to engage with parties and reach a settlement in our rate review. The $225 million settlement reflects a carefully balanced compromise with key stakeholders, including Public Utility Commission staff, the Office of Consumer Advocate and various industrial energy user groups and unions. The rate adjustment builds on the service reliability enhancements we've made in Pennsylvania in recent years. It supports upgrading additional distribution grid equipment, ongoing tree trimming and improving customer service levels. At the same time, it provides additional resources to help vulnerable and low income customers manage their bills. This month, the administrative law judge recommended that the commission approved the settlement. We anticipate approval in December with new rates taking effect on January 1, 2025. In Ohio yesterday, after careful consideration, we filed to withdraw our fifth electric security plan referred to as ESP V. As we have discussed previously, the ESP V order did not give us clarity on key conditions throughout the term of the ESP. Specifically, conditions for our distribution capital recovery rider and the vegetation management rider were only defined through the base rate case and not the five year period of the ESP. Although we had previously requested a rehearing on these issues, a recent Ohio Supreme Court ruling limited the time frame the commission has to grant rehearing, effectively resulting in our application for rehearing being denied by operation of law. The withdraw, which is subject to a commission order, will result in the Ohio companies reverting back to ESP IV until an ESP VI is filed and approved. We expect to file ESP VI by early next year, better aligning the review of that ESP with the review of our Ohio base rate case. This alignment should reduce risk and provide needed certainty for our customers and the company. Turning to other regulatory matters. We anticipate an order by the end of the year in our Ohio Grid Mod II case. You will recall, we filed a partial settlement agreement in April, focused on deploying automated meters for all of our Ohio customers, similar to our end-state peers. In New Jersey, we expect BPU approval this week for JCP&L's Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan. Program costs of $817 million from January 2025 to June 2027 are included in our financial plan. As a reminder, JCP&L earns its authorized return on the included program investments. Currently, we are in settlement discussions on JCP&L's infrastructure investment plan, EnergizeNewJersey, which includes significant investments over five years to provide customer benefits through system resiliency and grid and substation modernization. As we look to the future needs of our customers, we must address the challenges that are rapidly coming to the U.S. electric system. Analysts forecast that data center and AI share of U.S. electricity consumption will triple to 390 terawatt hours by 2030, equal to the energy use of approximately one-third of U.S. homes. In our own footprint, load study requests for facilities of 500 megawatts or more have already more than tripled compared to 2023. While we have transmission capacity to support data center investments, we are being thoughtful about our approach to ensure that our existing customers have adequate protections and that we appropriately manage risks. In PJM, the July capacity auction produced record high prices that will impact monthly residential bills by 11% to 19% beginning in June of next year. Despite the increase in prices, there wasn't any new dispatchable generation that cleared the auction. This is concerning to us on behalf of our 6 million customers as we think about service reliability and customer affordability. These are complex demand and supply side issues that require long-term thinking and strategy to appropriately support customers' energy needs. We will always advocate on behalf of our customers to ensure reliable and affordable electric service, and we're committed to working collaboratively across the industry to address this challenge on our customers' behalf. We are laser focused on executing against our plan, which significantly improves the customer experience through resiliency and reliability investments, grid modernization investments and enhanced tools and communications. It also supports a cleaner grid and increased load growth through operational flexibility. Delivering these benefits to our customers and communities fuels attractive returns and the compelling value proposition we offer to shareholders. Our updated 2024 capital investment plan of $4.6 billion is 24% more than we invested in the full-year of 2023 and 7% more than originally budgeted. Our prudent infrastructure investments to support the customer experience together with incremental opportunities such as PJM's RTEP process offer FirstEnergy a long runway for growth. With our Pennsylvania rate case settlement, we achieved another milestone, demonstrating our ability to reach constructive and reasonable regulatory outcomes that support our customers, our strong affordability position and our attractive risk profile. Our year-to-date results represent improved earnings quality that is driven by growth in our core regulated business. This earnings growth and strong dividend yield represent a compelling shareholder return with upside potential. We are building the right team and culture and we have the financial strength to deliver on this plan. This is a new FirstEnergy. I'm proud of the progress we've made and excited about our future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Thank you for joining the call. I'll provide a few more details on our financial performance and regulatory matters, address economic and customer trends and provide an update on our financial initiatives. Let's start with a review of our financial performance. Our third quarter earnings of $0.85 a share were at the low end of our guidance range. Operating earnings versus plan were mostly impacted by storm restoration expenses. As Brian mentioned, we experienced a number of storms in New Jersey and Ohio, including a large number that did not meet the regulatory threshold for deferral. Restoration activity resulted in about $30 million of non-deferred storm O&M, which represents 10% of the consolidated O&M in the quarter. Absent this unusual storm activity, we would have been closer to the midpoint of our guidance range. In fact, total year-to-date storm restoration costs are $550 million, of which about $60 million were included in O&M with the remaining amount included in our investment plan or deferred to the balance sheet. The $0.85 per share for Q3 compares to $0.88 per share in the third quarter of last year, which included a significant state tax benefit in our corporate segment. In our Distribution business, earnings were $0.39 a share in the quarter compared to $0.37 a share in 2023. This reflects higher customer demand, mostly from the mild temperatures last year and rate base growth in formula rate investment programs, partially offset by other items, mainly the impact of the Ohio ESP V that was effective June 1st of this year. Operating expense reductions in this business were offset by higher storm restoration expenses. In our Integrated segment, consistent with what we have seen throughout the year, earnings increased $0.09 a share, which is a 32% increase over last year. This reflects the implementation of new base rates in Maryland, West Virginia and New Jersey, rate base growth in distribution and transmission formula rate investment programs and lower financing costs, partially offset by higher storm restoration expenses. In our stand-alone transmission segment, operating earnings were $0.13 a share compared to $0.17 a share in the third quarter of last year. Rate base increased more than 10% year-over-year as a result of our transmission investment program, but this was offset by the dilution from the 30% interest sale of FirstEnergy Transmission to Brookfield, which closed in March of this year. When adjusted for this transaction, results increased $0.02 a share for the quarter. Finally, in our Corporate segment, we've reported a third quarter loss of $0.04 a share versus earnings of $0.06 a share in Q3 of last year, a difference of $0.10 a share. The largest drivers were the absence of a state tax benefit recognized in 2023 that resulted in a 10% consolidated effective tax rate as well as lower planned earnings from Signal Peak. These were partially offset by lower interest expense from a decrease in average total debt outstanding at FE Corp., a reduction from $6.9 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to $6.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Turning to our year-to-date results. I'll remind you that in the second quarter, we took charges for the resolution of the OOCIC and SEC investigations. Those settlements were completed during the third quarter as we work to move beyond legacy House Bill 6 matters. Year-to-date operating earnings primarily reflect new base rates in our Integrated business, growth from formula rate investment programs and stronger customer demand compared to last year, although weather-related sales are still below normal on a year-to-date basis. These were partially offset by higher planned operating and storm restoration expenses, the impact related to the FET transaction and lower planned Signal Peak earnings among other drivers. And as Brian mentioned, we narrowed our guidance for the year from $2.61 to $2.81 a share to $2.61 to $2.71 million per share, reflecting a midpoint of $2.66 per share versus our original midpoint of $2.71 a share. This reflects a series of unique items in the year and Q3 that impacted our guidance. Residential demand is down 2% year-to-date versus plan, reflecting the impact of mild weather from this winter, although we did see some of that turnaround in Q2. The impact of the Ohio ESP V, which reduced DCR revenue relative to our guidance by $50 million annually beginning June 1st of this year. And although we have captured O&M reductions to address these challenges, the increased storm restoration O&M expenses in Q3 required us to adjust the midpoint of our guidance. More detail on our third quarter and year-to-date results can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website yesterday afternoon. Turning to regulatory matters. As Brian mentioned, in Pennsylvania, we filed our settlement on the base rate case and the ALJ recommended the Pennsylvania Commission approved the settlement. We view this settlement as constructive and supportive of our investment strategy. The agreement, which includes an increase in net revenues of $225 million, supports investments to strengthen the grid and service reliability, while enhancing assistance programs and the customer experience. It also provides for an enhanced vegetation management program to improve reliability metrics. The settlement was based on a 2025 projected rate base of $7 billion in related cost of service, the difference between our original request of approximately $500 million and the $225 million in the settlement mostly relates to proposed future expenses, such as accelerated storm cost recovery and higher depreciation expenses, which will now not be incurred. The revenue adjustment represents a 4.7% rate increase for residential customers and our residential rates remain 2% below the average of our end-state peers. To stabilize electric bills, the settlement includes a stay-out provision for new rates until January 1, 2027, which is consistent with our plan. This settlement once approved would result in four constructive outcomes in base rate cases over a 14-month period. These cases provide annual revenue adjustments of nearly $450 million, allowing our regulated utilities to increase investments to better serve our customers. In Ohio, Brian mentioned that the decision to withdraw our Ohio ESP V. The objective is to avoid the uncertainty in ESP V with respect to certain conditions, work to get clarity on key rider provisions and ensure that rider programs are addressed in the appropriate form of an ESP. The Ohio political charitable spending audit was also completed in the quarter with no new House Bill 6 related findings. The audit report concluded that approximately $15,000 was charged to pole attachment customers. And the reported knowledges that we already agreed to refund this amount with interest. Additionally, hearings were held in the corporate separation audit earlier this month. In New Jersey, as Brian mentioned, we expect the final order this week in our energy efficiency and conservation program for January 2025 through June 2027 that addresses energy efficiency, peak demand reduction and building decarbonization. The $817 million total program includes $784 million of investments that will earn a return on equity of 9.6% and an equity ratio of 52% and be recovered over 10 years. Looking at economic and load activity in our region, economic trends remain positive, including GDP growth in all five states and an unemployment rate in line with the U.S. average. Customer demand remains positive overall. We're seeing weather-adjusted load growth of about 1% over the last 12 months, while residential and commercial load are essentially flat, industrial demand increased approximately 3% led by the chemical and automotive sectors with growth of 7% and 4%, respectively. Turning to our liquidity position and financing plan. On October 24th, we enhanced the company's overall liquidity position by increasing JCP&L's credit facility by $250 million to accommodate its increasing investment programs and extended the maturity date on all eight liquidity facilities by one year. Moving forward, FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries have $5.9 billion of committed liquidity to support growth. As of October 28th, FirstEnergy's total liquidity, including cash on hand was approximately $6 billion. So far in 2024, we've completed four long-term debt transactions at our regulated operating companies totaling $1.4 billion at a weighted average coupon of 5.1%. In early September, as part of our strategic financing plan, FET launched an $800 million debt transaction in a private offering with SEC registration rights. We priced the senior unsecured notes in two tranches at a weighted average coupon of 4.78%. This transaction, which will be used to redeem $600 million of FET notes, resulted in greater transparency and broadening the investor audience with the deal being 10x oversubscribed. JCP&L is considering a similar structured transaction. And finally, earlier this month, recognizing our progress on legacy issues, our improved credit profile and constructive regulatory outcomes, Fitch upgraded FE Corp.'s issuer and unsecured credit ratings to BBB flat from BBB- and several subsidiaries received a one-notch upgrade. FE Corp. and certain subsidiaries remain on positive outlook with S&P. 2024 has been an exciting year marking several important milestones in our transformation. We believe we are in a very good position with the financial strength and opportunity to build on our momentum and become a premier electric company that delivers value to our customers, communities and investors. With that, let's open the call to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey guys. Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza : Brian last week, you guys filed in the PJM load committee indicating kind of load increases of 4 gigs and seeing 3 gigs in APS zones. Those slides that you guys submitted indicated some customers are over 700 megawatts with one being 1.2 gigs in Ohio and some similar trends in Pennsylvania with one customer being a gigawatt. I guess how real are these projects? Is the spend incremental, and could any of these kind of correlate with co-located deals with certain nuclear assets in the area? I guess some color there would be great. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks for the question, Shar. We are definitely seeing an increase in these large load requests for conceptual and specific design load studies. In 2024, we've had over 60 requests for either conceptual or detailed load studies of 500 megawatts or more. And so we think it's real. These people are talking to us about specific locations, specific investment plans. As you know, we have a number of places where we previously had our own power plants and where there are other industrial centers, places like aluminum smelters that have shut down, where we have transmission capacity to serve large customers at this scale. So we think our -- we have the transmission capacity. People are looking to us. There's land available. And we believe it's real from the discussions that we're having with these folks. Some of these things are public. You've seen in places like the panhandle of Maryland. You've heard about things like quantum loophole there, which is a very, very large load, and it's meant to be expansive capacity relative to the Northern Virginia data load center campuses. And we're seeing other interest in what they call the panhandle of West Virginia, which is just across the border from Maryland there and then along the lake and the Ohio River Valley. So it's real, it's coming. The conversations we're having with people are detailed about when and where they're going to be investing on our system, and we look forward to serving those customers as they come online. Shahriar Pourreza : Can you confirm, Brian, if any of the ones that are over a gigawatt because it just meant is customer one, customer two. Are they data centers? Brian Tierney : I would say yes, they are. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly on ESP V withdrawal, can you maybe just dig into kind of the financial impacts from reverting back to ESP IV. And does vetting through ESP VI, while in the GRC kind of complicated things just given the number of unrelated moving pieces in the current GRC filing like goodwill treatment? I mean this is kind of the first time in a while, the PCO is looking at all the riders. It's a lot to juggle. So maybe just some sense there. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Yes. So thanks for the question, Shar. The financial implications of the withdraw of ESP V are not significant. It's really more of a risk play. It's the idea that certain of the riders didn't -- that are covered -- should be covered in ESP V were punted to the general rate case, so we didn't know what their treatment would be beyond that. And this really allows us the opportunity to time the alignment of ESP VI now with when the general rate case will come out. We've talked to our people and rates about this and said, does this complicate things in the general rate case. And the answer we got was this actually simplifies the general rate case and puts the riders where they appropriately belong in ESP VI. This is not -- this is something we are hoping to avoid on rehearing. And then an order out of the Ohio Supreme Court really withdrew the opportunity to address these in rehearing, and that really tipped our hand. But it's much more of a risk reduction play rather than a financial play around ESP IV versus ESP V or VI. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. That's perfect, Brian. That's super helpful. I'll see you guys in about a week. Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Nick. Nick Campanella : Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Shar's question just to tie that one off. Just the large load requests, how much capacity is on your transmission system today to facilitate those requests? And then separately, but somewhat related just with these large loads, potentially things still targeting for behind the meter and you're kind of flagging the higher bills in PJM. How should we kind of think about like an 11% to 19% increase against like a 6% distribution rate base growth outlook? Can you still kind of execute on that against that build outlook? Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you for the question. First, on the capacity that we have, we think we have several thousand megawatts of transmission capacity to be able to serve data center and other loads. And like I said earlier, it's mostly associated with transmission capacity that was used for either power plants that are no longer operating or large industrial customers that have moved on to other places. So we think we have a significant amount of unused capacity that's available to be consumed by data center or other large loads. And I just want to remind people that that's actually good for existing customers, right? We're taking that existing capacity and spreading it over more units for more customers, and that's a rate positive for existing customers as they're consuming unused capacity. In terms of the rate impacts of capacity auctions and the like, those capacity auctions take up headroom and cost our customers real dollars. And the thing that we're concerned about there is that are they actually getting increased capacity and enhanced reliability for the dollars that they're spending in 2025 and '26. People talk about sending price signals. We're not sure that these price signals are in the near term or long-term going to result in incremental net new capacity. And so we're concerned about that. We're talking to legislators, regulators, customers about solutions that would actually add net new capacity at reasonable costs and are looking to be positively engaged in discussions to bring that about. So we don't think today that the costs that are being passed on are going to impair our ability to get regulatory recovery for the investments that we're making, but think that we as well as others need to be prudent with every dollar that we're asking our customers to spend for electric service. Nick Campanella : Yes, that makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate your comments there. Quick question, just good to see the Pennsylvania settlement filed in September, and I know we'll have that order in December. But you are showing like a 2.5% earned ROE in Pennsylvania and every $0.07 is for 100 bps improvement and ROE does seem like it would be material. Just should you get back to a regular return here in '25? Is that the way to kind of think about this? Or are you still going to be lagging? Jon Taylor : Hey, Nick, this is Jon. So that 2.5% was based on the filing that we made in the application. So requesting the $500 million net revenue adjustment. So that included a lot of proposed expenses to support that rate increase. Now that we have the settlement in place, we'll be at a much more normalized level in terms of the return there. Nick Campanella : Okay, thanks for that clarification. Have a good day. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David Arcaro : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Jon Taylor : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Wondering if you might be able to elaborate on some of those options that you mentioned you're discussing in terms of getting more generation built in PJM. Brian Tierney : Yes. So I think that there are some solutions that could be outside of a PJM capacity auction construct that might bring certainty of net new capacity coming on board relative to the sending of price signals that we hope will result in incremental capacity coming on. And I think there are market constructs that -- or there are constructs that we've seen out there that have worked, things like NIPA, NYSERDA, where you have state agencies that run auctions to bring in certain types of capacity. I could see that being effective in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland and others, where a state agency could ask all comers to bid on net new capacity in a given year of a certain type, I'd say, dispatchable generation in a year like 2030, 2031 of a combined cycle nature and allow everyone to bid on delivering that. IPPs could, investment companies could, utility companies could. And you'd be certain through a contract and certain design milestones that you would know that, that net new capacity was going to be delivered in that state. And I think it's just solutions like that rather than sending price signals you hope will be effective, actually have real auctions with real counterparties with real milestones. So you'll know that, that capacity will be there when the state needs it. David Arcaro : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, as you look out at all these load requests, out over the next several years. Just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of looking at your own load forecast. When might you reassess and give a new longer-term outlook in terms of what you're expecting for low growth? Jon Taylor : Yes, Dave. So I think the current plan right now is to provide that update early next year, likely on the fourth quarter call as we update the longer-term plan. So I think the plan is to give 2025 guidance as well as a 2025 to 2029 CapEx and long-term growth rate plan sometime -- yes, on the fourth quarter call. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Jon Taylor : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Fleishman : Yes, excuse me. Good morning. Thanks. Jon Taylor : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yes. So I know there's been some challenges this year, but just the -- I just wanted to clarify, you reaffirmed the 6% to 8% growth off basically last year's midpoint? Is that... Brian Tierney : That's right. Jon Taylor : So the way to think about it, the $271 million was based off last year's midpoint of $254 million. Our growth going forward is going to be based off the $271 million. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So you're not going to -- right, you're not going to go down to this lower half. Jon Taylor : Right. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Good. And then just for '25 specifically, just as you -- on the one hand, you have to manage this period with the -- going back to the prior ESP, but you do get the DCR back. But then on the other hand, you get Pennsylvania rate relief. So is '25 kind of okay to be within that 6% to 8% growth rate? Jon Taylor : Yes, absolutely. I mean if you think about the Pennsylvania rate case, you think about our CapEx plan in terms of the amount that's formula rate driven plus the financial discipline that we need to create in the organization, we feel really good about our plan for next year. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Good. And then maybe, Brian, back to the prior question about Generation Solutions. The idea you mentioned of like state agency and the like. In the key -- in your key states, would those require a legislation? Or would they be feasible without a build? Brian Tierney : I think solutions like what I described where you'd have a state agency would definitely require legislative action. Things like utility builds in and of themselves would not necessarily include legislation changes in West Virginia, Maryland and Ohio, but would require legislative changes in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We are not interested in building competitive generation. If a state would like us to when we'd come to an agreement, we would consider adding long-term regulated generation if that was in the state's interest to do that. But I think we'd get a lot of opposition from places like IPPs and others. If they would like to commit to build in something that looks like a state auction, I think that would be a way to have all comers bring their solutions to the problems that the states are facing and might be less likely to have strong opposition from others in the IPP camp. Steve Fleishman : Got it, thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lonegan with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lonegan : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So you have no equity in your financing plan beyond the employee benefit program. Just you're highlighting a lot of incremental investment opportunity. How should we think about financing that additional spending, what portion do you see that needed to be funded with new equity? Jon Taylor : Yes. So Michael, I mean, we talked about before, we have some cushion in the metrics that would equate to about 5% of additional CapEx to the $26 billion. And if you look at some of the transmission opportunities that we're pursuing, depending on the different types of solutions, some of that might even fall outside of our current planning window and would be in '29 and beyond. And a lot of that, quite frankly, is going to be at the FET business, which would be obviously a 50% ownership with Brookfield. So based on everything we know right now, we're comfortable with our current plan. Michael Lonegan : Great, thanks. And then secondly, so you just talked about some cushion in your metrics, you obviously increased your 2024 capital program and had higher storm costs during the quarter. Where do you expect to end this year on FFO to debt versus the targeted 14% to 15%? Jon Taylor : Yes. So this year, we'll probably be just under 13%, and a lot of that was impacted by the SEC and OOCIC payment as well as that unusual storm event we saw in Cleveland back in August. I mean, those two events alone were about $200 million of FFO. So if you were to strip that out and normalize that, I think we'd be closer to 14%. Michael Lonegan : Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. If I could follow-up on the storm question. I think you said some of the costs didn't meet a regulatory threshold for recovery or, I guess, maybe for capitalization. Does that change how you'd respond to storms going forward or anything the utility could do to maybe get a rider or something that prevents that from happening again? Brian Tierney : So would never change how we respond to storms, Anthony. We are going to work with dispatch and with all haste to return our customers who are not out of service due to storm activity. And restoring customers to serve as safely and as quickly as possible will always be a key priority for us. We will always, at the same time work with regulators and others to make sure that we get timely recovery for what we spend on storms. I don't think people would like us to even consider and we won't, how much it costs to get people back as quickly as we can, but we should also have some comfort and certainty that we'll get timely recovery for what we prudently incur restoring people to service. So I think there's a balance there. I think regulators want us to spend what we need to, to prudently get people back to service, not wasting any dollars at all, but to be thoughtful about the dollars we spend and to have a comfort that we'll get recovery for everything we prudently spend. It's been a remarkable year for storms, and it's not just us. I think you're seeing it with other utilities across the country. And I see things like mutual assistance and how they actually happen. It was fascinating the August 6 storm that we had in the Cleveland area, right? It was such a localized event that it basically hit only us in the Cleveland area and Cleveland Public Power. And our neighbors, right, my friends at AEP, our friends at DT&E, PP&L and others who are neighboring us offered resources immediately and they are on the ground the next day helping us get people restored. It was a privilege for us then to be able to return those favors during the hurricane events that we had. And our people were interested to go, willing to go, happy to go, help in those circumstances that our employees tell me where absolute dire circumstances for the communities that they helped restore to service. So we're going to spend what we need to prudently to get people back, and we think it's fair that we have comfort and certainty that we'll get recovery for what we do spend returning people. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And lastly, when you unveiled a 6% to 8% growth rate and capital plan, I think you had said some of the updates today. I think your capital plan is roughly 7% higher than you originally thought. Does that change where you think you would land in the 6% to 8% EPS growth rate? Should we think of now you're trending more towards the higher end as you increased your CapEx by 7%? Brian Tierney : So Anthony, that increase of CapEx for 7% was 2024 over originally budgeted. The plan that we laid out previously, the $26 billion five-year CapEx plan really gives us about 9% of rate base growth on average over that period, and that's what drives the 6% to 8% growth. So we're still within that range. It's still being driven by our investment in our regulated properties and timely regulatory recovery of that. And remember, a significant percentage about 70% of the investments that we make are covered by trackers and riders. Anthony Crowdell : Great. If I could just squeak one in. I guess to Steve's question or David's question, you talked about solutions and options maybe to add generation at reasonable cost. You mentioned some state agencies here in New York. I'm just curious what do you think the timing is on a solution? Like how long do you think customer bills are impacted by these capacity charges before like the state or the government will act to mitigate it? Brian Tierney : Yes. So that's the concern, Anthony, is the disconnect between the timing of adding significant amounts of load, whether it be data center or other, load that you can really add to the system in about two to three years and to construct, to permit, construct and procure for a power plant probably takes in the order of about six years. So are our customers going to pay higher capacity auction prints for the next six years before any net new capacity shows up from the price signals that are being sent to this market? It's a concern. And I think states would do better to take these matters into their own hands, the way traditional IRP states do like West Virginia, and be sure that the capacity is there when the state needs it, rather than hoping price signals have the intended effect six years from now. Anthony Crowdell : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Anthony. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So just wanted to follow-up on those last comments about the six-year wait. I mean that's how long it would take to build a new power plant anyway, right? So how different would it be versus some intervention in the competitive power market? Also, I don't recall you guys have been making the opposite comment when capacity prices were clearing at $30. I don't remember you guys mentioning that you're concerned about how these low capacity prices will impact the availability of dispatchable power plants in PJM? Brian Tierney : Well, I don't -- to your last comment, I'm not sure that was a question, but -- to your -- the first part of your comments, it does take about six years to permit and build a power plant from the time that you can see of doing that. The difference for an actual auction where you are contracting with someone to do that is you can monitor their permitting, procurement and construction during those six years, versus the PJM capacity construct where you're hoping that people respond in a way you would like them to today to have a result six years from now. So it's a difference between contracting, monitoring and verification versus hope. And those are two different things entirely. Angie Storozynski : Right. But that one is a regulated set up, but the other one is a competitive bond market. I mean that's basically how it works, no? Brian Tierney : No, that's not right. What I'm talking about is a construct that is a market where you do have an auction, where a state would have an auction, say, all comers, IPPs, utilities, investment companies, insurance companies, can come and offer to build what would you charge me to do it, what would your price be. And then we would have -- and you'd have a winner from that auction. So it would be a market. And you would go from there. And yes, so both our markets is what I'm saying, and both are market solutions. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Understand. Then secondly, so you're talking about the transmission capacity in Ohio. But when I actually look at the power flows in PJM, Ohio is an importer of power from Pennsylvania, especially, I think, your area. So now Pennsylvania wants to clearly build up demand for electricity in it states that would seemingly limit the flows of power into Ohio. So is that fair to add load in Ohio, given the fact that the state already relies on imports of power? Brian Tierney : Yes. So when I talk about capacity, I'm talking about transmission capacity. So we have the wires capacity to be able to serve load. We are in a regional power pool where there are power flows from states who are long, the states who are short, and that's currently handled generally through the PJM power markets. What's needed because of this situation that we find ourselves in with resource adequacy, we do need, as a region, and then as you divide that out in the states, we need net new dispatchable capacity to be added. And whatever construct enables us surety around that happening at a reasonable cost to our customers, we're in support of. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then changing topics about the withdrawal of ESP V in Ohio. So now -- I mean, I understand that it was not optimal to say the least. But now basically, the entire 2025, we will be waiting for to have a visibility into earnings power -- your earnings power in Ohio. And I mean, I don't quite understand how that helps to add visibility. I mean it almost as if we have now two rate proceedings. So isn't this doubling down on the regulatory risk associated with Ohio? Brian Tierney : No, Angie, really the opposite. We're going back to the certainty and transparency that we had in ESP IV that we knew what our earnings power was there. We knew the timing of it. And this actually better aligns the result of an ESP VI that we're going to file with the Ohio base rate case. So rather than creating uncertainty, it actually will bring more certainty and actually reduce risk. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Brian Tierney : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : So just back to the capacity alternatives that you were mentioning. I think with Steve's question, you mentioned the ability of doing perhaps something in rate base, if I heard you correctly, in West Virginia, Maryland and Ohio. Was that correct? Brian Tierney : So in West Virginia, certainly. And in Ohio and Maryland, there are provisions and current law that would allow a regulated utility to build generating capacity and get recovery for it. Paul Patterson : So -- and I heard everything you've said and a lot of it makes a lot of sense, obviously, considering what's going on with the capacity markets. But when I think about this, just you guys building modest levels of capacity, it could have a dramatic impact on the capacity market, so to speak, given the vertical demand curve and what have you at Q3 and others have said. And I'm just wondering, it would seem to me that would it just be sort of a modest or a reasonable cost to customers, it would actually maybe perhaps lower cost to customers, if you were to take into account the wholesale market impact. So I guess what I'm wondering is that seems like something -- given what Maryland and Ohio and Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- all these, these consumers already been voiced about the capacity market. What's your sense about the appetite or simply just going forward with that as opposed to a rather more arcane, I don't know how to put it, the stakeholder process, the FERC process of going through the PJM capacity market stakeholder process, if you follow what I'm saying? Do you see almost more -- a lot more efficient maybe just to go that way? Brian Tierney : I do, Paul. So this company just spent a lot of time and balance sheet capacity getting out of the generation business and moving into a deregulated wires-only stance. We're going to be very thoughtful about returning to investments in generation in states where we just got out of it at many of their -- being responsive to many of their energy policies that got us here. We're going to be thoughtful and try and come up with solutions that don't add undue capacity to -- undue risk to the company, but help solve the solution. So we're open to a number of solutions. The one we're not open to is going into the competitive generation business. Paul Patterson : Generation business, Okay. Fair enough, I guess, stay tuned, I guess, right? Okay. And so then just finally, just a follow-up on the approval process for withdrawing this ESP V and what have you, -- it sounds like you need something from FERC -- I'm sorry, from PUCO on this. But it seems like -- is that a -- do you see that as being -- it doesn't look that controversial to me from the outside, but could I be missing something? Brian Tierney : It should not be controversial, Paul. It's something that we've seen it happen before with other in-state peers and in getting that approval took about a month from the time that they ask for it. So you're just going back to a construct that everyone was comfortable with previously. And obviously, we can't put our own rates into effect so we need to go through the regulatory process, but it should be a brief process, and it should not be controversial. Paul Patterson : Awesome, thanks so much. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Sophie Karp : Hi, thank you for squeezing me in here, Dan. Just wanted a quick follow-up on the discussion about the potential changes in the market construct, right, that you're talking about. Given that there are several states that you mentioned, right, with these power flows between them New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, would those states have to act simultaneously in this new design of the market to avoid one state cross subsidizing effectively another with the rate there's money from the state? Or how would that work? Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you for your question, Sophie. I don't think so. According to the Federal Power Act, each state is responsible for making sure that it has the amount of generation that's needed to serve its state's needs. States like West Virginia do that through a traditional IRP process and other states do that through a PJM solution using the capacity construct that PJM has. So having signed on to that construct, that's what many of the states are using. If they think that's working for them and their customers, they can stick with that. If they'd like to take matters into their own hands more directly, they can avail themselves of some of the alternative solutions that we suggested. But no, they could act on their own and many states have done that already even in PJM. Sophie Karp : Got it. Got it. And just to clarify, are you saying that even though the states deregulated market utility is allowed to own generation in the states in the current legal framework? Brian Tierney : Yes. And again, Sophie, those are issues that are driven by state law. And in our states, State of West Virginia, Ohio and Maryland, the states do allow for utility-owned generation. Sophie Karp : All right. Thank you so much. Brian Tierney : Thank you for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Weisel : Hi, thanks everyone. Good morning. I'll be brief here. Just quickly on the CapEx increase for 2024, specifically what drove the increase? What kind of spending was it? And was it a pull-forward for 2025? Or were these incremental opportunities that you didn't anticipate six or 12 months ago? Jon Taylor : Yes. So some of the increase, Andrew, was storm related. So in our distribution business, specifically in Ohio, they had the big storm in August. So some of it was storm CapEx related. There was some LTIP work in Pennsylvania that we needed to fund as well in our distribution segment. And then the rest of it was what I would consider transmission opportunities, incremental opportunities for this year. So the $26 billion is still intact. I mean -- but I don't think it's going to take us off track in terms of the CapEx that we plan for next year. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned, Jon, that you're going to do a refresh and roll forward on the fourth quarter call early next year. Do you have a sense in terms of timing around the PJM transmission opportunities? Will you have a sense about potential wins there? Or would you make assumptions around that? Jon Taylor : Yes, we'll have a pretty good sense by that time. I think there are several advisory committee meetings between now and then with the final PJM Board approval expected in the February time frame. So we'll have a good sense of that. And if we don't have final approval, we'll kind of let you know where we stand and what we have in the plan and what maybe is to come depending on the outcome of that. Andrew Weisel : Very good, thank you. Jon Taylor : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question. Paul Fremont : Thank you very much. I was going to ask if you could walk us through the procedural path to withdraw ESP V at the PUCO. Does -- will it involve testimony and hearings? What's involved in terms of getting PUCO approval? Jon Taylor : Yes. So Paul, we have precedent where there was a case in 2019. The application was filed. There were comments filed amongst different intervening parties. There were no hearings in that particular case, and then there was a commission order on the application to withdrawal within a month. So that's kind of the time line that we're working on. So my sense is there would be comments filed on the withdrawal application, the commission then would consider those comments and then rule on the withdrawal sometime within 30 days based on that precedent. Paul Fremont : And the precedent that you're talking about was the application to withdraw contested by intervener parties? Or was it widely accepted by intervener parties? Jon Taylor : I'm sure it was mixed. I mean, there was probably some that objected to the withdrawal. There was probably some that supported the withdrawal. But I'm sure just like any regulatory proceeding, there was some that objected, some that are supported. Brian Tierney : The ability to withdraw is codified in Ohio legislation. So it's there. It's a real thing. It's been tested before and actually administered and executed by a utility previously and approved by the commission. So there's precedent for doing exactly what it is we're asking to do. Paul Fremont : Great. And last question, what type of proceeding was it that you're referring to in 2019? You are seeing or? Brian Tierney : You can put up. It was Dayton Power & Light in their ESP -- in their current ESP, and you can pull up the docket, I'm sure, on the Utility Commission website. Paul Fremont : Perfect, thank you so much. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",
