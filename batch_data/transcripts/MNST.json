Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Sir, you may begin. Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice President and President is -- our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during this course -- the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has remained unchanged. Recent studies confirm that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable despite the entry of energy drinks into the market. As previously indicated and stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed. The Institute of Medicine held a public workshop in August 2013, in Washington, D.C. to help determine whether there were potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. In January 2014, the IOM forwarded a report of the proceedings to the FDA. Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine, for teens under 18, are coffee, soft drinks and tea, and not energy drinks. In fact, the recent article published by -- in the Journal of Pediatrics analyzed the consumption data. Even after including young adults, aged 19 to 22 years, in the most recent 2-year period study, 2009 to 2010, only some 6% of the caffeine consumed by all persons 22 and under was from energy drinks, as compared to 24% from coffee and 38% from soda. If young adults aged 19 to 22 are excluded as they are neither children nor adolescents, the percentages are even lower with the result of less than 3% of the caffeine intake for children and adolescents 18 and under comes from energy drinks. To put the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we, again, remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce large brewed coffee contains approximately 350 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink. On April 30, 2014, the American Beverage Association formally adopted new U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are supported by the company, as well as all the other major energy drink companies in the U.S.A. In the litigation between the company and the city attorney of San Francisco, the company recently filed a motion to strike allegations in the complaint, challenging the theory for relief previously rejected by the court, as well as a motion to bifurcate and/or stake of claim relating to the safety of Monster Energy drinks pending resolution of the ongoing FDA investigation on the safety and labeling of food products to which caffeine is added. These motions are calendared for hearing on May 21, 2014. In the Kona federal securities case that has been pending since 2008, the company entered into a stipulation of settlement on April 16, 2014, that, if approved by the court, will resolve the litigation and result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurers -- insurance carriers. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general, or about the first quarter as best as we can, after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business. In the first quarter of 2014, the beverage market, generally, in the U.S.A. continued to experience softness. In contrast, the energy drinks sector in the U.S.A. grew in the high-single digits. In the first quarter, the company achieved record growth sales, up 10.6% to $613.7 million and net sales up 10.7% to $536.1 million. Sales of our Ultra line continued to improve during the quarter, while sales of our Muscle Monster line continue to gain traction. Sales of our Monster Original Green Energy Drink also increased in the quarter. According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 15, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster was the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 23.1% market share. Although Muscle Monster's ATV distribution levels have improved, they are still relatively low at approximately 56%. We are working with our distributor partners to improve these levels. We believe that as we achieve increased distribution levels for that line, Muscle Monster's market share will continue to improve. We are pleased with the sales achieved in the first quarter. Our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the energy category, as a whole, in certain of our overseas markets, including within EMEA, and especially Eastern Europe, increased distribution of sales in the U.S.A. of our Ultra line, as well as new Muscle Monster line, sales in the U.S. of our Ultra line were low accretive did result in some cannibalization, generally across our existing SKUs, primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. The sales of Monster Energy products in glass bottles in the U.S.A. were lower during the quarter. Our operating income was up 38.7% to $148.9 million. During the first quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by professional services costs of $5 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing, promotions, ingredients, labeling and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature. Diluted earnings per share increased 49% from $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2013 to $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Distributed terminations were 0.01 million in the 2014 first quarter compared to 8.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year. Net income was reduced by foreign currency losses of about $200,000 this quarter as opposed to $4.7 million in the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate decreased from 39.8% to 36.1%, which was primarily the result of profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets. The effect on diluted earnings per share of professional services costs related to regulatory matters and related litigation, net of tax, is approximately $0.02 per share. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 26, 2014, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 6.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 15.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 4.7%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 3.2%. Sales of AMP were down 12.3%, NOS increased sales by 26.3%, and sales of Full Throttle increased 5.7%. According to Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 6.7% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 13.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 2.8%. Rockstar was up 2.6% while 5-Hour was down 1.7%. NOS was up 24.7% and AMP was down 7.7%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.1 points over the comparable period a year ago to 35.4% against Red Bull's share, which was lower at 34.5%. Rockstar's share was lower at 7%, 5-Hour's share was lower at 9.2%, while NOS share was higher at 3.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 12.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 7.1% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot energy was 21.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel, in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 8, 2014, the energy drink category grew 2%. Monster sales increased 11%. Our market share increased 2.4 points to 28.3% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 0.5 point to 36.6%. Rockstar sales increased to 12% and its market share increased 1.5 points to 16.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 14.5% in the month of March 2014. Monster sales increased 23.3%. Our market share increased 2.6 points to 37.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 19.2%, and its market share decreased by 11 points -- 11.1 points to 26.5%. Boost sales increased 42.9% and its market share increased 3.1 points to 15.7%. And Vivo 100, new in 2013, has grown to 8.5% market share, while Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator decreased 3.1 points to 9.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 11.8% to $514.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, from $460.2 million in the same period in 2013. Operating income for the DSD segment increased 34.2% from $139 million to $186.5 million. Gross sales from original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to increase in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products, together with the sales of our Ultra and Muscle Monster lines, as well as certain other Monster Energy products, was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy, the Monster Rehab line and Import. Net sales of our Peace Tea line were higher. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $21.8 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, mainly due to the reduced sales of Hubert's Lemonade, in part, due to a purchase last year by a large customers that was not repeated in the same quarter this year. Operating income decreased from $0.4 million to $0.3 million in this quarter. For the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally were consistent at 23%. Other sales at 2% for the period were also consistent with the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2014 amount to $144.3 million compared to $130.7 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in such sales are sales to company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2014, in dollars, were 5.2% higher than the same period last year. Net sales in Europe and the Middle East alone were 9.3% higher than the same period last year. As I mentioned in our conference call on February 27, in anticipation of the introduction of a sales tax on energy drinks in France on January 1, 2014, our distributor in France increased its purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 by an estimated $3 million and which we estimated resulted in a reduction in our sales to our French distributor in the first quarter of 2014 by a similar amount. We have implemented a formula change for our products sold in France to address this tax. We estimate that as a result, our sales in Europe were negatively affected in the quarter by about 4.2%. Sales from our distributor in South Africa during the quarter were also negatively impacted by a price increase in South Africa, which took effect over a few months in 2013, as well as the shift in timing of a promotion with a large retailer from the first quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014. Monster continues to gain momentum and increase its market share at retail in Europe, and in particular in the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany and Hungary, as well as in South Africa. Group progress is made in Western Europe and Africa in increased distribution levels and sales. While the Central and Eastern European market is still incurring operating losses, we are seeing improved results from the strategic changes we implemented during last year. Overall, our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter of 2014. The addition of Monster Ultra Blue and Ultra Red, as well as the launch of our Muscle Monster line in 2013, was successful. We're continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. In addition, we are proposing to launch Monster in a limited number of countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa this year. Sales of the Monster Energy brand internationally, including Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. Relative to the comparable quarter last year, the weaker yen negatively affected our growth sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. Sales to our Japanese distributor in the first quarter of 2014, both in yen and in dollars were higher than sales in the comparable quarter last year. Production in Japan has commenced and plan for production elsewhere in Asia continue to move forward. We are also moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India, as well as in South Africa. Sales in Chile continued to progress. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution from month-to-month. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Net sales of Peace Tea for the first quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and have added a mango juice cocktail to the line. We are planning to launch an iced coffee line in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand later in 2014. In the Warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the first quarter of 2014 were lower compared to last year, largely due to a purchase by large customer last year that was not repeated in the same quarter this year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the first quarter of 2014 was 53.5% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2013. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a small decrease in allowances and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit percentage achieved in the first quarter in North America in 2014 was higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit percentages achieved outside North America for Monster Energy were lower in the first quarter of 2014 than in the comparable quarter in 2013. We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that, at current levels, increases in cost of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were 4.7% versus 4.6% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.7% in the quarter versus 13.5% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs, as well as commissions were higher, cost of premiums, allocated trade developments, social media and point-of-sale were lower during the quarter. Total general and administrative expenses decreased 3.3% in the first quarter. The decrease in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to an $8.3 million decrease in distributed termination costs in the quarter. The decrease in general and administrative costs was partly offset by increased professional service costs for legal accounting and other professional costs. $2 million of the increase in the quarter related to regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks. Federal expenses and insurance costs also increased by approximately $3 million. Operating income increased 38.7% over operating income for the same period a year ago. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $200,000 for the quarter as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the 2014 first quarter was 36.1% compared to 39.8% in the 2013 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets. During the 2014 first quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $312 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $438.9 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments, which are comprised of certain auction rate securities, decreased to $8.1 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Included in the long- and short-term investments are auction rate securities having a fair value of $14.5 million. Accounts receivable, net, increased to $342.1 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade account receivables were 50.5 days at March 31, 2014, and 50.4 days at March 31, 2013, compared to 42.5 days at December 31, 2013. Inventories decreased to $204.1 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 73.7 days at March 31, 2014, which was lower than the 83.5 days of inventory at March 31, 2013, and lower than the 75.6 days at December 31, 2013. We recently launched the new Punch Monster line by converting our existing 2 Dub Edition products into Punch Monster products with new can graphics and flavors. We are planning to launch new additions to the Monster family later in 2014. Gross sales in April 2014 were approximately 7.8% higher than in April 2013. We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately affected by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points : North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2014 first quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013; two, Nielsen market statistics show that energy category growth has recovered to the high single digits, and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole; three, new additions to the Monster family is that we're introduced during 2013 are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company sales; four, we believe that our recently launched new Punch Monster line will appeal to a broader consumer demographic than the Dub Edition and will be positively received by distributors and consumers in 2014. Our new Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup Muscle Monster Energy shakes are performing well and should further enhance the Muscle Monster line in 2014. Turning to international markets, we're pleased with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Chile. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of March 2014, the actual days of the 13-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 18.7% to 21.1% in Spain; from 18.4% to 18.5% in South Africa; from 16.2% to 17.9% in France; from 18.6% to 27% in Greece; and from 7.9% to 8.1% in Germany. In Great Britain, Monster's retail market share value for the 4 weeks ending April 26 grew from 10.3% to 10.7% -- 10.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country; Nine, it is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 26 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing single-digit growth while Monster continues to grow in excess of the category; ten, sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. We have finally commenced production in Japan; 11, we were finally able to obtain a regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India late last year. Sales in the quarter have progressed satisfactorily; 12, as advised by Ambev, distribution levels and their sales in Brazil to their customers continue to improve. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Want to talk a little bit about the margin expansion in the quarter and, Rodney, can you talk a little bit about, particularly on the gross margin line, with the gross margin up a lot this quarter, how are you -- how should we look at that in terms of maybe some favorability of raw material trends versus some of the more structural changes you're making in terms of moving the manufacturing more to the local markets? And then, also, if you can give us a little bit more color on the SG&A leverage, which was very strong in the quarter. Are you finally getting to that point in some of these markets, you talked about European being positive, where you're really getting solid leverage on some of the marketing investment you've been making for the past couple of years? Rodney C. Sacks: Well, let's just deal with the margins. I think, sales mix is clearly one of the most important factors that has influenced the margin change. This can be seen from the fact that we've had the very successful increase in sales of our Ultra margin -- Ultra line. The Ultra line cost-wise has a lower cost of goods than some of the other lines, particularly lines like the juice lines or any of the java lines or Muscle Monster lines. So when you weigh the numbers, clearly, that has helped our margins. And we also had, as we indicated earlier, some cost of goods as well. Also sales of Peace Tea, in many cases we've gone away from the $0.99 price, pre-priced cans, so our margins have improved slightly on Peace Teas. We've also been able to lower some freight expenses, we reinstated a co-packer in the Texas market, which is a pretty big market for our product, which, if you eliminated a lot of freight we were incurring in shipping product into that market from surrounding states. So when you take into account the fact that you're looking at the substantial volume we've actually been able to achieve, look at the Nielsen's on the Ultra line, and being a lower-cost item, that has primarily been the primary source of the extra margin. We also had to put of our pricing on 24-ounce and that is starting to show through on the margins as well. And that package is also starting to come back and do quite nicely. The -- with regard to the operating expenses, one of the large differences was incurred in basically the cost of premiums decreased due to the gear promo, which was very successful promotion we've done in past years, but it was costly promotion, in supplying gear and sending it out to consumers. And so we had alternative promotions this year, which we felt were good, but didn't involve us in having to contribute as much back to the consumer through benefits. So that helped us quite a bit. We also, as we indicated, we sort of basically took a closer look at International Operations. We pulled back on a number of expense items, some sampling and sales people in the markets. We also pulled back on some sponsorship opportunities and promotions internationally, with the result that we -- overall, we've just been able to, in fact, reduce our selling expenses, which has been very fortunate for us. If we just look at -- we also have the effect, as we indicated earlier, of the distributed termination costs, which is a large item, which hit our P&L last year in the comparable quarter. So clearly, we are getting to a point now with the steps we've taken to operate more leanly overseas. We are getting positive profits from Europe now and we actually -- we believe we will continue that sort of trend going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I guess, I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the April number, the plus 7.8%. Maybe just talk a bit about what you're seeing from a trend standpoint that resulted in what seems to be a pretty good deceleration for a first quarter, and maybe, just more broadly, how you're looking at trends through the first quarter and into April, given the January number was also better than what the overall first quarter sales number came in at. Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, I think, again, in this month, in particular, I think, you got to take into account that these are one monthly numbers. We've seen some non-matching trends when you look at things like Nielsen because we basically find that we don't work to timing a particular month. And if you take, for example -- we've seen some destocking or just managing of entire inventories from our distributors. Again, we -- in many cases, we don't have visibility to their stock, but for example, I'll give you one example. In 2013, the short lead orders, which are orders that are placed -- they're require shipment within 6 or 7 days, last year, we received from CCR a total of 42 orders, which was 1.3% of the total orders got into the we-urgently-need-inventory category. In 2014, the short orders -- short lead orders had increased to 272 orders, which was 6.7% of the total orders. We believe they are -- they have reduced inventories and are managing their inventories much more tightly, but the result is that, that means that they've run out inventories more quickly on this, and then they need these urgent orders to replace them. But again, most of our distributors and bottle partners we don't have visibility on their stock policies. Sometimes, you get some idea, we have a feeling about it but we don't always. So I think that what is important to us ultimately is the trends that you see from the Nielsens, which are really showing consumer demand at the retail level. That's showing the pull-through from month-to-month. And we think that. When you look on a longer-term basis, those are more indicative of the trends than looking at the one monthly numbers. But -- and that's why we do have that caution because really is something we need to be cautious about. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And maybe if you could just touch on sort of sequential trends through first quarter. And then just sort of a related question, how much was the FX impact on the international revenue growth line? And inclusive of that, what was the Japan impact? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that was about 0.5% -- it's about a 0.5% higher, yes. Operator : . Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Can you talk about -- and this is a follow-up to what John was asking in the international profitability, I mean, you mentioned that Europe is now positive and also some tax benefits from profitability in some international markets. Can you give us some idea where profitability is in some of your key markets and which of them are now profitable versus not making money? Rodney C. Sacks: I think we've -- we have broken it down to as much as we want to, we don't break it -- we're not going to break it down any further. Because the other markets are really new and they're choppy. They're being affected by many factors where you do promotions, where you've got -- we do have issues with foreign exchange and goods damages and shipping costs. Like for example, with Japan, we're now right in throes of changing over to local production so we think that will have a big effect. But the tale of the issues we've been facing, affect these numbers quite dramatically. And for that reason, we think that it really wasn't -- it's not appropriate to break it out into the other markets here. We have focused on the main international area at the moment, which was Europe, which we've gone positive and that's, I think, a very important turning point for the company. We believe that as the other markets starts to settle down, we start to be able to get local production, those results will also improve as we go forward. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then the tax benefit that you had during the quarter, is that sustainable through the rest of the quarters as well, the lower tax? Rodney C. Sacks: We think regarding [indiscernible] it's probably pretty much up. Hilton H. Schlosberg: As long as there's profitability off season, yes. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Got it. Okay. And then... Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, so going -- first, going back to what you're saying regarding channel inventory relative to Nielsen trends, which have been stronger, at this point, do you feel there's still essentially excess inventory to work through from your distributors or are you seeing more of a catch-up that's yet to come as the year progresses? Rodney C. Sacks: It's -- again, it's something which we really don't have the visibility on, but we have seen this trend. And it gets to a point where, obviously, we are seeing -- it's not going to be able to go on forever. But -- and as we believe they are likely to start getting more in line. But that -- we're just facing our sales. And unfortunately, people look at the Nielsens in advance, and then obviously you look at our sales and then you do the comparison all the time. They just really are not comparable. There's various reasons why we don't necessarily match all the time, particularly in newer markets where you're starting a new market, your customer may order too much or may order to little. And then, you have a catch-up, and then he gets pipeline, and then the next year, he's got a sales trend, and then all these factors that continue to influence the relationship between Nielsen. As you get to more stable markets, long mark to [indiscernible] they do have -- start to have a much closer correlation but even in the U.S. nets that I alluded to, we have this situation now where we do feel we have -- there has been a realignment by our larger customers to try and manage down their inventories, and that has an effect on our sales versus when you look at the market. Obviously, there are other issues in the market that also change, which is timing, but that would be the main reason we feel. Operator : And our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess, Rodney, I guess, I just wanted to circle back on the April number I don't want to really get this into too much -- just understanding it's just one month. But what I'm hearing from you is that from a consumer kind of takeaway, all the trends that you're seeing, both at Europe from your brands and in the category levels seem to be relatively healthy. The full down [ph] really appears to be driven by the inventory movement at your wholesalers, primarily in the U.S. market. Are there any other markets that you're seeing this inventory kind of disconnect continuing? I think, in the second quarter, or sorry, the first quarter, you said Japan was up year-over-year. I think Asahi had numbers up by 40% so I'm just trying to reconcile what's happening in the U.S. from underlying versus inventory, and then also some of the international markets. Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. If you take the -- basically, South America and Asia Pacific markets, in the month, those were down. But if you take, which is the point I made and our sales were down because of timing, or mistiming whatever the case -- whatever you want to put it, of purchases, when we went to new distributor last year, and it was very choppy. So you end up with one month where there was a high level of purchases coming out of Brazil, and then this month, you end up with a much lower level. But if you go through the numbers, and you look at the sales out of that distributor in Brazil, and that is one particular distributor where we do have some visibility on their sales numbers. Their sales numbers have continued to grow and are substantially higher than last year. But our sales into them, in April, specifically, are negative. And if you take the Asia Pacific, it's not only -- it's largely Japan but then there are a lot of other markets in that one month while we were up in the quarter, we were negative in that month. And that was part of that transition month where we changed over from supplying goods made in the U.S. to local production. So again, we believe that will change as we go forward during the quarter. But those had -- those 2 markets had quite an effect on the April number. The April number would have been quite a few percentage points higher if you take -- if you just take into account sales in, basically, North America and Europe, or EMEA, as we put it. So we're quite comfortable with the numbers going forward. We think the categories showing pretty resilient and healthy signs. And as you can pick up from the Nielsen, that really is the best indicator of ultimate consumer demand for the brand and for the category. Operator : . And our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA. Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division : This is Brian Doyle, filling in for Caroline. I was just wondering -- just on international profitability, again, you said EMEA is now profitable. I was wondering if you could just update us on how big that is as a percentage of your total international revenue. And then, secondly, just on the international gross margin, I was kind of surprised that it was down in the quarter. My first thought that, that would largely be currency-related, but it sounds like currency was only like 0.5 point hit to the top line, so just a little clarity on when the sort of international margins are going to improve. Rodney C. Sacks: It's -- at the moment, it's -- the actual net margins are small in relation to the sales. It's just basically at the beginning of turning the corner. And we -- as we go forward, we believe we will continue to improve there, but we do have thinner margins overseas. We did indicate, I think earlier, that our gross margins overseas were slightly less than its comparable periods last year. And we're looking to, again, trying to deal with -- address that. Again, we think some of that will be addressed as we look for -- go forward. One of the things we will be looking to do is to introduce new products where we believe we will have better margins internationally as we expand the product range overseas. So we, obviously, are looking to try and improve those margins, but at this point a lot of that will depend on our ability to get our cost down. Operator : . Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to your host, Rodney Sacks, for any further remarks. Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad. We reiterate our products are safe, our frothy labels and the caffeine contents of a Monster at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than 1/2 the milligrams per ounce of the caffeine levels contained in Starbucks and other coffeehouse brewed coffee. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn you over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, you may begin. Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg our Vice President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind the listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed May 9, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 7, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 12 billion Monster Energy drinks have now been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. To put the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we again remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce-sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine there is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink. On April 30, 2014, that American Beverage Association formally adopted new U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are supported by the company, as well as all other major energy drink companies in the USA. The litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco is proceeding through the discovery process stage. In the Kona federal securities case on July 29, 2014, the court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the proposed stipulation of settlement. When finalized, the settlement will resolve the litigation and result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurance carriers. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including -- with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the second quarter as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business, in the second quarter of 2014, the beverage market in the USA, our largest market, continue to experience softness. DSD volumes declined in all major channels, including the convenience and guest channel. In contrast, the energy drink category continued to grow in the mid-single digits. Together, the RTD coffee drink category and the energy drink category were the 2 best-performing sectors. In the second quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $779 million, up 7.6%. Net sales were $687.2 million, up 8.9%. Our Original Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew in excess of the growth of the category as a whole. Particularly noteworthy is that sales of our Ultra line continued to improve during the second quarter. We are still in the process of implementing the repositioning of our DUB line into our Punch Monster line, and we are also repositioning our Juice Monster line. New graphics and formulas for these lines are now finding their way onto retail shelves. While we are pleased with the sales achieved in the second quarter, our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the Energy category as a whole, both in the U.S.A., as well as in our international markets. While sales in the U.S.A. of our Ultra line were accretive, that did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs, primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. However, during the quarter, Lo-Carb made up a portion of its previous sales losses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 1.9 percentage points to 55.2% from 53.3% in the second quarter of last year. This increase was primarily due to lower allowances compared to the prior year, increased sales of our Ultra line, as well as lower cost of goods, particularly in North America, due to lower sweetener costs. Increased selling prices for our Monster 24-ounce line and increased prices for our Peace Tea line, which is now sold primarily in non-pre-packed priced cans. Operating income was up 20.3% to $215.8 million. During the second quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating profit contributed by international operations, particularly the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Additionally, our operating results improved in Asia-Pacific and South America, principally due to improved profitability in Japan and Chile, and a reduction in losses in Australia. Operating income in Mexico was also higher. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were below last year. While sponsorship fees were higher, costs of our TDM met program were lower, driven by the reduction in Europe. Additionally, premiums were lower as our 2013 Gear program was not repeated. Point-of-sale costs were also lower. Foreign currency losses were substantially lower than last year. The effective tax rate decreased from 39.3% to 34.7%, primarily due to profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense and as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets. Net income was $141 million, up 31.9% over net income of $106.9 million earned during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 31.5% from $0.62 to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2014. According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 26, 2014, for all outlets combined and the convenience grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including shots, increased by 5.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.08%. 5-hour's decreased by 2.5% and AMP decreased by 11.1%. Sales of NOS increased by 25.3%, and Full Throttle increased 3%. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 4.6% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 6.6% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4.3%; NOS was up 30.5%; Rockstar was down 7.2%; 5-Hour was down 3.6%; and AMP was down 1.8%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, Monster's market share in the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 0.6 points over the comparable period a year ago to 34.6% against Red Bull's share, which was lower at 35.3%. Rockstar share was lower at 6.9%, 5-Hour's was lower at 9%, while NOS share was higher at 3.5% According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, sales in Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 4.9% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.1% higher. Java Monster sales continue to exceed those of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12-weeks-ended June 28, 2014, the Energy Drink category grew 2%, while Monster sales increased 16%. Our market share increased 3.5% points to 27.9% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.of a point 9 to 38.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 11% and its market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 12.2% in the month of June 2014. Monster sales increased 6.6%. Our market share decreased 2 points to 38.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 18%, and its market share decreased by 9 points to 24.4%. Boost's sales increased 15.4%, and its market share increased by 0.4 to 13.7%. Drivet100, new in 2013, has grown to 12.2% market share, while Coke market share represents Burn and Gladiator together decreased 2.9 points to 6.6%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased by 9.8% to $660.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014 from $601 million in the same period in 2013. Operating income for the DSD segment increased 19.1% from $215 million to $256.1 million. Gross sales of our Original Monster Green energy drink continue to increase in the quarter, as did sales of both the Ultra and Java Monster lines. However, the increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales in certain SKUs, including Monster Energy, Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and the Monster Rehab line and import. Net sales for our Peace Tea line was higher. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $27.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, mainly due to reduced sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles. Operating income increased 16.9% from $1.9 million to $1.3 million this quarter. Net sales of Peace Tea for the second quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represents a 4% of growth sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represent 9% of sales, down from 11% in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in 2013. Other sales of 2% for the period were also consistent with the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the second quarter of 2014 amounted to $180.2 million compared to $160.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in the sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and cargo-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2014 in dollars were $80.3 million, 14.6% higher than in the same period last year. Once we continue to gain momentum and increase its market share at retail in EMEA and, in particular, in Greece, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and South Africa. We're now starting to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented in the second quarter of last year. Overall, our EMEA division traded profitably during the second quarter of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate of the company. Central and Eastern Europe contributed in operating profit before allocation of corporate overhead for the first time. Gross sales in the Africa Pacific region grew 29 -- sorry, Asia Pacific region grew 29.9% versus the comparable quarter last year. Gross sales in Mexico were higher for the quarter. During the quarter, Japan contributed an operating profit to the division, and sales there continued to increase satisfactorily. In addition, significant progress was made in Chile. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution in sales for month-to-month. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. In the quarter, we launched Monster in Angola, Serbia, Macedonia and Bahrain. In addition, we are planning to launch Monster in a number of additional countries later this year, including Bosnia, Georgia, Oman, Qatar and Nigeria. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Production in Japan commenced in February and contributed to the improved results earned last year in the quarter. In addition, we are continuing to make good distribution progress in India. Our plans to produce Monster Energy Drinks in India, as well as in South Africa, are progressing. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the second quarter of 2014 was 55.2%. This is 53.3% in the comparable quarter in 2013. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially due to lower allowances, product mix and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales due to higher percentage of our sales that was represented by the Ultra line, as well as lower cost of goods, particularly in North America due to lower sweetener costs, increased selling expense prices of our Monster 24-ounce line and increased prices of Peace Tea, which is now sold primarily in non-pre-priced cans. Gross profit percentages achieved in the second quarter, both in North America, as well as outside North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. As indicated on our last conference call, we have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that our current levels increases in costs of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter were 4.4% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.5% in the quarter versus 11.6% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs, as well as commissions and merchandise displays were higher. Costs of premiums, point-of-sale and allocated trade development and TDM met program were lower during the quarter. General and administrative expenses increased 8.9% in the second quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs, other expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. Our effective tax rate in the 2014 second quarter was 34.7% compared to 39.3% in the 2013 second quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related to tax expenses as a result of the prior establishment of a valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets. During the 2014 second quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $373.1 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments of $454 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments, of which option rates securities comprised $12.8 million increased to $51.7 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Accounts receivable net increased to $395.5 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 45.3 days at June 30, 2014, and 42.8 days at June 30, 2013, compared to 40.1 days at December 31, 2013. Inventories decreased to $207.9 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. The average days of inventory was 60.8 days at June 30, 2014, which was lower than the 71.3 days of inventory at June 30, 2013, and lower than the December 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013. We are planning to launch Monster Unleaded, a new non-caffeinated energy drink in the Monster line in the U.S.A. later this year, as well as Ultra Sunrise, which is an extension to our successful Ultra line. Ultra Sunrise has a citrus-based flavor. Our new Monster Energy Valentino Rossi energy drink that was positioned as a summer promotion in selected countries in Europe and South Africa, has been well-received by both retail buyers and consumers. We are in the process of introducing an Ultra Black variant as a summer promotion with 7-Eleven in the U.S.A. In the ordinary course, we introduced additional existing SKUs in various countries around the world from time to time. However, I would like to specifically mention that we are planning a full launch of Monster M3 in glass bottles in Japan later this month, as well as a Coffee Monster Energy drink in Japan later this year. Gross sales in July 2014 were approximately 7.9% higher than in July 2013. The increase in gross sales in the United States was, in fact, higher than this percentage. The increase in gross sales was partly offset by decreased sales in certain international markets in July as compared to last year mainly due to destocking that occurred in some countries. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of our results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 second quarter gross margins in North America, as well as international, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the energy category continues to grow in the mid-single-digits and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category is all. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2013 and earlier this year are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company sales. We believe our recently repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines will appeal to a broader consumer demographic and will be positively received by our distributors and consumers in 2014. We believe that Monster Unleaded will appeal to consumers since the true caffeine, who until now were not consumers of energy drink, as well as to consumers who would like to limit their daily consumption of caffeine but wish to increase the consumption of Monster, particularly later in the day or early evening. Our new strawberry and peanut butter cup Muscle Monster energy drinks are performing well and should further enhance the Muscle Monster line in 2014. We are now rolling out our peanut butter cup Muscle Monster drink to the general market. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan. Spain, South Africa, Greece, Belgium, Germany, Brazil and Chile. According to the Nielsen, in the 4-week period to the end of June 2014, the actual days of the 4-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 21.6% to 22.9% in Spain, from 8.3% to 9.1% in Germany, and from 7% to 7.9% in Sweden. In France, our market share remains flat at approximately 16.8%. In Belgium, our market share increased from 7.1% to 8.2%, and from 9.9% to 10.3% in Great Britain. Monster's retail market share value for the 4 weeks ending May 2014, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 18.3% to 19.9% in South Africa, and according to IRI, from 19.5% to 24.1% in Greece. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. In Chile, in May, Monsters retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7% to 11%, and in Brazil, in June, from 2.9% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. Sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So maybe just on international margins. The first time, I think, many of your markets actually showed profitability in the quarter. So I just wanted to get some color on what the key drivers of that improvement were in the quarter, how sustainable that improvement is? And if you look at the overall gross margins for the company in that 55%, do you think this is, at least, the sustainable level, at least for the foreseeable future? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that Europe -- I think the improved profitability came from, I think, better distribution in -- largely, in existing accounts. I think we still have an opportunity to increase distribution in numerical number in additional accounts. So we've been trying to focus on improving the quality of distribution and we will continue to do so. And also, in some of the markets that are becoming more mature, we also, as we indicated earlier, we did review our operating model and took down some of the -- some of our marketing and costs that we had spent in establishing the brands in those markets. We felt that we were able to do so going forward, and so we will continue to do so on an ongoing basis. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Then just maybe on some of your innovation that you've have called out in the call. I guess the last comment you made at the shareholder meeting was really trying to be maybe more thoughtful about innovation and, perhaps, thinking about innovation being more incremental to your brand portfolio. So if you can help us kind of -- how you think about the upcoming innovation? Do you really think this is now more incremental to your existing portfolio? And as you go into the market, kind of thinking about how you would approach getting extra shelf space as opposed to taking one out and placing the new innovation with -- replacing with your existing brand? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that, that is illustrated by the value we sort of believe in, for example, in the Punch Monster line. We believe there is a subset sort of set of energy, which is in Punch products. I believe that by focusing our brand back into that Punch line with 2 SKUs, it will, in fact, help us. It is, in fact, doing that. We believe we are increasing distribution on the Punch Monster line. It has taken a little bit of time to get the new graphics out. There are new flavors that are more fit the Punch profile a little bit, they've being tweaked a little bit. And so we believe that is more strategic and that will become a key subset for us. We also believe that -- and many years ago, when we had the Juice Monster product, we rolled them out and -- but I think there were less sort of strategically focused as being a subset. And again, we had some fall-offs just because they became older and less-exciting and people went on to newer and more exciting things. So we've -- Khaos has continued to do well, but the -- and maybe started a little bit -- it was probably a little bit too heavy as a drink. So again, we've looked -- people are really turning to, we believe, lighter, easier-to-drink product. So again, the focus that we've had is in changing and reducing the juice content of our drinks because the -- and maybe sort of had a connotation to that, added percent juice. We've taken the juice content down quite substantially. So we've changed the name to Ripper, which is in line with the -- that, basically, product that we have overseas. So again, we've now clearly delineated what the product is. They're in very bright-colored cans. They've got texture on them. We believe they'll stand out on their own. There will be 2 Juice Monsters. And once we can solidify some distribution losses that we had on M-80, which is now Ripper, and get the line into a solid distribution, at position, we will then strategically, probably, expand that line with one more juice product. But again, there is a strategy behind it. We think there is a place that it can go, but it needs to be able to be identified separately. It shouldn't blend in with the larger line now because there are many SKUs, and it should have its own identity. So those are, again, in the process of getting -- rolling out new product cans, which we think are really, really attractive, as well as having lighter, lower-content juice flavors, which we believe are far more drinkable and easily drinkable because they are still carbonated. Again, we've been -- we think we've been strategic. We understand what's been happening to the Ultra line. It's been very successful. And again, we've -- we're going to introduce a selected one this year, which is Ultra Sunrise. We have plans to introduce another one next year. We're going to decide on that. We're also going to go through a test on a summer promotion with our Ultra Black. Test that flavor. See how that flavor does and see how the product does. And either that will be the line extension for next year or we'll have another one, which we have in test at the moment. Internally, we'll make a decision on that. So that's really where I wanted to look at that. The Ultra Sunrise is, in fact, a very similar product to what we did in Europe with the Rossi can. The Rossi can, again, although it says summer promotion, and that has been our strategy for it, strategically, as we see the success of that can, we have the opportunity if we want to, obviously, to turn that into a more permanent SKU. It's called the Doctor, which is the nickname for Rossi, but -- the name by which he is known. It is a full-calorie drink. The Ultra Sunrise here is a low-calorie or 0-calorie drink so -- but the flavor profile is all the same. We think that's a great flavor profile. And so we think that those will -- both products will play well. Rossi is not as well-known. MotoGP is not as popular sport in the U.S. as in Europe, and so we believe that the Rossi product is more appropriate for Europe. It still gives us an opportunity, obviously, to use -- to introduce Ultra and the extensions, including Ultra Sunrise in Europe later. But for the moment, we were looking to see where we want to go with the Rossi product and then the Ultra Sunrise here. We also have 1 or 2 line extensions. We repositioned our Rehab line, which has been a little soft, and we've really emphasized and changed the can emphasis on the fact that it's an iced tea and an iced tea lemonade line. That is the focus. We've -- obviously, strategically, we're going out to secure distribution of that line in the tea door. And that's how we're trying to obviously obtain more real estate for our brands and to get -- improve the depth of distribution. As we go through that, we are revising some of the flavors and tweaking them in the Rehab line, and we probably are planning to introduce one more Rehab product next year. So again, that's the sort of line in which we are following on product innovation. I don't want to go too much into detail of what we might do in the future. But we also are looking at introducing I think it's one more product in the Java Monster line. The Java line is doing nicely. We have, again -- we've strategically reformulated and repositioned the Kona Cappuccino line. It was in a darker can. I think the Kona, sort of -- it was a little bit confusing to consumers because we had a Kona blend, which is our original product, which is simply a good quality but an original basic quality coffee product. And the -- so we've now changed the graphics, again tweaked the formula and made it in a very much larger can, in line with the multi-content in it. So we have a cappuccino product, which we are rolling out now with the new graphics. So those changes, we believe, are really -- they may seem small, but they've been done carefully, and we think that's important because when you look at our distribution levels, we still believe we have a lot of low-hanging fruit in the line extensions that have substantially less distribution than the top view. And we believe that, that will continue to help drive improved sales and profitability. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : So Rodney, my question is on broadly the energy drink category in the U.S., and we've seen some slowing here, and you look at the Nielsen data in the convenience and gas channel, and we've gone from low-double-digit growth to about mid-single-digit growth in the category. So my question is broadly, what is your consumer research telling you that's driving the slowdown here? What are your expectations for the balance of the back half of the year? Do you think that innovation is going to help drive an acceleration? And just broadly here, are you getting the sense now that some of the consumer health concerns that are hitting the carbonated soft drink market are kind of seeping into consumers' awareness here as well? Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. We really don't have any market research on what is driving the trends. We obviously see the continued soft trend across beverages in general. We think that the Energy category is being slowed down a little bit by the negative growth that is being experienced by 5-Hour, which is an energy shot. We lump it in the same sort of category. So we think that is pulling down a little bit of the growth as well. The growth would be higher without the energy shots in the category as a category. But overall, we are just seeing that slowing trend. We think that it's -- it seems to be around the world. It seems to have slowed a little bit as well in some of the -- in most of the international markets. But we believe that eventually that will sort of settle down and ride itself. We think there have been some health concerns about CSDs, and then the CSDs have now translated into the dark CSDs, so illogically, because of some scares about sweetness. Again, we think this too will pass, and I think things will settle down. But there are certainly some changing consumer trends and preferences. And those are something that, I think, we'll deal with them. We will deal with some of them, I think, by adapting our products to be more drinkable, to be lighter, lighter in calories and lighter in taste. And that's the sort of profile that we have for the Ultra line, and that's what we're now doing in reformulating the juice line. On the other hand, there are a lot of -- a majority of consumers still like full-flavored, heavy-bodied drink, just as they like light wines, and they like heavy wines. So we're trying to obviously cater for the full gamut of consumers, and that is the reason we introduced Muscle Monster. We think there is a trend for consumers, again, on a broader-based and pure sports people or bodybuilders to actually have drinks with protein in addition to the having the energy component, and that is why we introduced that line. So these are lines that are starting to solidify themselves, and we think that they will continue to grow. And we have -- I think we're well-positioned because of the broad range of our line to actually address this as we go. But we don't have any specific ideas as to why some of these of things are happening. I think a lot of the beverage companies would like to be able to have a crystal and see, but we just don't. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I just have a first quick follow up question on Ultra Sunrise specifically. Is your goal to merchandise this new product within the CSD door? And then how realistic do you think this will be if, in fact, that is your strategy? Rodney C. Sacks: This product has got nothing to do with CSDs. It has nothing to do with CSDs. It's got nothing to do with Mountain Dew. This product is going to be merchandised in the Energy door with the other Ultra products. It is a citrus flavor, probably more aligned into an orange flavor. It's got nothing -- it's not designed to address Mountain Dew or Kickstart in any way. It is simply a lighter -- 0-calorie and a lighter-tasting and refreshing and easier-drinking energy drink, completely in line with the original Ultra White product. The whole Ultra line mantra is the same. That is the subset that we are focusing on. And we're not changing the characteristics of that product at all. So if anything, our product is probably -- this product is aligned more to an Orangina-type of flavor profile. And -- which is similar to, again, to the Rossi can, and not to any of the other CSDs. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stiefel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So 2 questions on international. First, what drove the slowdown on easier comparisons, which continued into July? Could you quantify the impact from timing and/or destocking? And then secondly, can you quantify the impact on international growth broadly from your focus on profitability? Rodney C. Sacks: I think there were a couple of factors that occurred in July. We don't want to go into more details because it is a single month. But -- and it varies quite dramatically. We believe that a lot of the factors that happened in July will not recur and it will make itself up into August, so we're not particularly concerned with it. But we really don't want to go into more detail on that front. It really was mainly destocking and movement and changes in production from one month to another because some of the production -- or some, actually, it's on an increasing level of production, is being handled in some cases by our distributors. And so their planning cycles are not necessarily linked to our sales and they will produce when they have gaps in production or when they feel they need it and we all find it and we try to smooth it out with them. But if we are finding that they were overproducing one period and then go down in inventory levels to another month, and then suddenly, the beginning of the month, start up again. And that is having quite a dramatic effect on some of our numbers on a month-to-month basis. Internationally, generally, we're starting to see some slowing but we've also tried to focus on getting many of the countries profitable. We will look again to accelerating sales but focusing on the bottom line and ensuring that we don't go back into the red in those countries. And so we're trying to just balance that through. We think that there has been some slowdown, but many of the international markets are really doing very well and starting to improve. Sales, for example in -- although we had a slowdown in international in July, and as I indicated, the actual sales in the USA were actually higher than the average company sales, the sales out in many of our markets, particularly in EMEA, from our distributors to customers, were up actually in the double digits in the EMEA in July. But our sales to our customers were substantially lower than that. So it's just a mismatch in July of some of those numbers. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin side and just -- was there a big contribution from local manufacturing in Japan and elsewhere? And is that expected to kind of continue as you open up in Korea and India? Or I mean, have we seen kind of most of the gains this quarter? Rodney C. Sacks: We think that the effect of local production in Japan was substantial and that really did help us. Sweetener cost was a big contributor as well as we started packing again at Dr Pepper in Texas, which also helped us -- we had stopped for a period of time, which was also beneficial. As we go forward, as we said, Japan is now onstream, where we're launching M3 in Japan, we're launching that with the local production from the get go. When we launch Coffee Monster in Japan, that will be locally produced. So again, that is being improved. We have had some challenges in getting going in Korea and South Africa with local production, getting their production up to speed and up to our quality, and same thing in India. We're all working with it and we're all making progress. And as those countries come on board, it will obviously improve the results there quite substantially. We recently expanded our production facilities in Europe by adding another facility, which we have approved. And so as we continue to really rollout and become more well -- better well-established overseas, we clearly will continue to derive the benefits from better production in those countries. And also, the other thing that will help with our margin, Bill, was just mentioned back there, it was lower allowances. We were able to achieve these sales by not having to go as deep with our CMAs and other allowances we've had historically provided to retailers. We think that we will be able to manage that on a similar level going forward. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks for closing remarks. Mr. Sacks, please go ahead. Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands, and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled, and the caffeine content of a Monster is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce. It's less than half the milligrams per ounce of caffeine level that's contained in Starbucks and other coffee house brewed coffee. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Mr. Sacks, you may begin your conference. Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is here with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed August 8, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 6, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the fast growing global energy drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to the Coca-Cola Company. Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution agreements in the U.S. and Canada to expand distribution into additional territories. Additionally, the Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in early 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we received the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. Turning to the business. During the third quarter, trends in the beverage industry continued to show weakness, although sales in the energy drink category continued to grow in the mid-single digits. In the third quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $738.1 million, up 7.5% from the $686.6 million. Net sales were $636 million, up 7.7% from $590.4 million. Our original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole. Sales of our Ultra line continued to show good growth in the United States during the third quarter. During the quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Black as a summer promotion with 7-Eleven. This promotion was successful, and we are evaluating whether to launch Ultra Black as a permanent item in 2015. We launched Monster Energy Unleaded, which is a carbonated version of our Green energy drink but contains no caffeine, at the end of the quarter. We also launched Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise, a carbonated energy drink, which contains 0 calories and 0 sugar and which is our fourth permanent item in our Ultra line at the end of the quarter. Finally, during the quarter, we launched M3 Monster Super Concentrate in glass bottles as well as a coffee Monster Energy drink in Japan. During the quarter, we also repositioned \u00dcbermonster, which was previously sold in 500 ml glass bottles, into 18.6 ounce resealable cans and lined price \u00dcbermonster with Monster Energy import. In addition, our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines are both achieving increased distribution and sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 1.7 percentage points to 53.8% from 52.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to lower cost of certain sweeteners and certain other raw materials, price increases in our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line as well as changes in product sales mix. Gross profit percentages achieved in the third quarter both in North America as well as internationally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. Operating income was up 25.4% to $189.9 million from $151.4 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. During the third quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan. Operating income was also higher in Mexico. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $9.4 million as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower than last year although general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased payroll expenses. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year, in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Cost of our TDM MET program were lower, largely driven by reductions in those programs in Europe. Additionally, premiums in point-of-sale costs were lower. Results for the 2014 third quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the 2014 third quarter compared with $6 million for the 2013 third quarter. Foreign currency losses during the quarter increased primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico and South Africa. The effective tax rate decreased from 38.8% to 35.6%, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. Net income was $121.6 million, up 31.9% over net income of $92.2 million earned during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 31.7% to $0.70 from $0.53 in the 2013 comparable quarter. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 25, 2014, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 8% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.2%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 8.6%. 5-Hour decreased by 6.1%, and AMP decreased by 9.6%. Sales of NOS increased by 33.9%, and Full Throttle increased by 5%. According to Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 4.8% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 7.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.8%. And NOS was up 14.7%, Rockstar was down 13.3%, 5-Hour was down 8.1%, and AMP was down 9.5%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 0.09 points over the comparable period a year ago to 36.3%, against Red Bull's share, which was lower than Monster's market share at 34%; Rockstar's share was lower at 6.7%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.7%; while NOS' share was higher at 4.1%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 6.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks' Doubleshot Energy was 18.7% higher. Java Monster's sales continued to exceed those of Starbucks' Doubleshot Energy. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended October 18, 2014, the energy drink category declined 1%, while Monster sales decreased 11%. Our market share decreased 2.7 points to 26.2% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share increased 1.7 points to 38.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 14%, and its market share increased 2.3 points to 17.5%. Monster's market share was negatively impacted over this period by Red Bull's summer edition launch with 7-Eleven and Monster's failure to have a comparable promotional activity this year with 7-Eleven, due to conflicting priorities from our distribution partner in Canada. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% in the month of September 2014. Monster sales increased 18.2%. Our market share increased 0.2 points to 33.8% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 14.8%, and its market share decreased by 8.8 points to 23.1%. Boost's sales increased 7.1%, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.1%. Vive 100, new in 2013, has grown to 19.1% market share, while Coke's market share, represented by Burn and Gladiator together, decreased 3.9 points to 6.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13-week periods ended September and October 2014 -- the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets and countries -- Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.8% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 8.3% to 9.8% in Germany; From 10.6% to 11.4% in Great Britain; from 22% to 22.7% in Spain; and from 7.2% to 8% in Sweden. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending September/October 2014 as compared to the same periods last year decreased from 21.1% to 19% in South Africa, although volume was up; and in France from 17.5% to 16.7%. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece for the 13 weeks to the end of September increased from 22.9% to 27.3%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2014, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 11.8% as compared to 8.8% last year; and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of September 2014 grew from 3.5% to 5.7% as compared to the same period last year. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 7.6% to $609.9 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, from $566.8 million in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 19.4% from $194.9 million to $232.7 million. Gross sales of our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to increase in the quarter, as did sales of both our Ultra and Java Monster lines. The increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales in certain SKUs, including Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and the Monster Rehab line and Import. Gross sales of Peace Tea for the third quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 10.1% to $26 million, from $23.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to increased sales by volume of aseptic juices and Hubert's Lemonades. Contribution margin increased from a loss of $2.2 million in the prior year third quarter to a profit of $0.6 million. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, up from 9% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 63% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally represented 24% of sales, up from 22% in 2013. Other sales of 1% for the period were lower than the 2% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter amounted to $173.2 million compared to $151.6 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2014 in dollars were at $75 million, 7% higher than the same period last year. Monster continues to gain momentum and increased its market-shared retail in EMEA and in particular, in Greece, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, Germany and Sweden. We're continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented last year. Our EMEA division traded profitably during the third quarter of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 79.4% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America grew 65.6% over the comparable 2013 third quarter. In Mexico, growth sales were marginally higher for the quarter. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution in sales. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. Although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. The Coca-Cola Company partnership should also help in achieving this objective. In the interim, we are continuing with our plan to produce Monster in India as well as in South Africa. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were 4.5% versus 4.6% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% higher in the quarter versus 12% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Premiums, point-of-sale costs and the TDM MET program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. General and administrative expenses were lower, although payroll costs was slightly higher, with the result that overall general and administrative costs increased 1.4% in the third quarter. Included in general and administrative costs were increased professional service costs, of which $2.6 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. Our effective tax rate in the 2014 third quarter was 35.6% compared to 38.8% in the 2013 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets. During the third quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $408.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments, of which auction rate securities comprised $4.8 million were $588 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased to $28.4 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Accounts receivable net increased to $330.2 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.5 days at September 30, 2014, and 44.7 days at September 30, 2013, compared to 40.1 days at December 31, 2013. Inventories decreased to $205.4 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 62.9 days at September 30, 2014, which was lower than the 78.7 days of inventory at September 30, 2013, and lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013. We are planning to launch Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab, Peach Tea and Energy early in 2015. Due to the strong response received to our summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have decided to convert that item into a permanent SKU in the existing countries in which it is being sold and to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. Gross sales in October 2014 were approximately 9.2% higher than in October 2013. The increase in gross sales in the United States were 7.4% and the North America was 9.1%. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. On the litigation front, the litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco is proceeding through the discovery process stage, the court has issued an order setting the case for a 2-week bench trial beginning in February 8, 2016. On August 6, 2014, the Attorney General for the State of New York issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a company employee. The company has moved to quash the second subpoena. The briefing on the motion is currently ongoing. In the Kona federal securities case, plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking approval of the settlement. The settlement class members have until December 1, 2014, to object to opt out of the settlement and the final approval hearing is scheduled for January, 29, 2015. Again, once finalized, the settlement will result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurance carriers. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the third quarter as best as we can after we've concluded our discussion on the business. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 third quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally, were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the energy category continues to grow, that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2013 and this year are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our recently repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to increase. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines that were introduced at the end of the quarter will commence contributing to sales in the fourth quarter and through 2015. Unleaded with no caffeine is designed to attract new consumers, as well as to increase usage occasions by existing Monster Green energy drink consumers. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Spain, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Greece and Brazil. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Just on the international business. Trying to understand 2 things. One, how much of an impact did the Canadian, I guess, 7-Eleven issue have on the total business? And then two, kind of longer term, as we look at the Coke partnership, does that change your near-term plan? Do you pullback? Do we expect some transition issues until it's signed? Just trying to understand if maybe there were countries that you were planning on going into or planning on expanding that you might, kind of, put on hold until everything is done. And how we should look at that over the next couple of quarters. Rodney C. Sacks: I think the Canadian impact was not substantial but it was there during the quarter. And I think you could see from the numbers that we showed for North America in October, that you saw the improvement coming through from Canada. And that's just timing and promotional issues. And we will do a promotion, I think, with 7-Eleven but it didn't fall into the quarter with Ultra Black. That is still -- that is being planned for Canada. With respect to the transition : The markets were not, at this point, major markets or markets that, I think, would really impact the results in -- certainly in the near term, but we just, obviously, felt it was important for at least -- make the disclosure that we had in fact deferred some of those introductions. Going forward, we just believe that we are going to continue to go forward pretty much as planned. There always is, obviously, a little bit of an effect on this -- on our results through the interim stage, because while we, obviously, are encouraging our distributors to continue giving the brand the same level of attention and investment, and we've tried to assure them that we will, obviously, compensate them appropriately, there is still some distributors who will naturally pull back and because of concerns as to whether they will continue to keep the brand and when there will be a transition. So that uncertainty, clearly, will have some effect. Although we don't believe it will be major, we do believe there will be some effect. But we really can't tell more than that. We are obviously starting to make plans for the transition. But again, until the transaction closes, there is -- we are limited in what we can do. But we are looking to close the transaction early in 2015 as we previously have indicated. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just 2 quick ones for me. On Rehab, Rodney, I was wondering if you could provide any perspective on that? And are there any plans there to kind of get that brand reinvigorated? And then the second question is our understanding is trends in the energy drink category are really taking off at Walmart and I was just hoping you can provide some context on kind of what's going on there. Is it just more cold cooler placement up by the register? If you could just give us some context on that? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that if you look at Rehab, the drop off that we -- or the decrease that we had experienced at the time we introduced -- or pretty much close to the time we introduced the Ultra line, has fallen off and the numbers are looking much better. That's still a major line for us. We have taken steps to just focus consumers on what the product is and to try and communicate better to consumers that it's an iced tea, that it's not carbonated. We are looking at some slight changes to the graphics, probably to align it more with a tea product, as opposed to, sort of, a carbonated energy drink, which has a stronger presence in a black can, traditionally. And we also believe that by some other minor adjustments, which we'll make to the line, we believe that we will have a good prospect of, basically, improving sales going forward. We are also introducing the Peach Tea, which is a nice variant. And so we believe that, that line will continue to grow again, but that's part of what we're doing. There was obviously some impact on that line from the introduction of the Ultra. We are seeing more of a comeback on -- also on our Lo-Carb now in the last quarter, that had dropped off more significantly in previous quarters and the numbers are improving on that product as well. And then finally, with regard to Absolutely Zero, which did have some fall off as well from the -- at that same time as we introduced the Ultra line, we have -- we're also taking steps to redesign the can and do things, and we're actually making some further improvements to the redesigned can. So we are hopeful we'll be able to get those sub lines or -- growing again. Thomas J. Kelly: Maybe I just could comment on Walmart. What's happened at Walmart is that they expanded the category both on the warm and on the cold shelf. We've invested in cooler placement with the organization, and I really would encourage you to visit a few stores and see the expanded sets and the positioning that we have now in the Walmart stores. It's actually very, very interesting, and we're excited with it. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Rodney C. Sacks: Hello? Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Rodney C. Sacks: We're not -- we're hearing silence. Operator : Our next question comes from John Faucher of JP Morgan. Rodney C. Sacks: Seems to be something wrong with the line. We are not getting any of the participants. We can't hear anything. [Technical Difficulty] John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So just 2 quick questions here, I hope. One, can you talk a little bit about foreign exchange and the impact on the international business as we look at it? Obviously, there's been a lot of volatility. So can you talk a little bit about -- less so on the top line but more so on the margins, how you feel like you're situated to deal with some of this volatility in terms of transactional FX, et cetera? And then a separate question, which is as you talk about returning some of this cash to shareholders, can you talk about what your criteria are going to be and how we should think about that as we head into 2015? Rodney C. Sacks: Hilton will discuss the foreign exchange, John. Hilton H. Schlosberg: John, we hedged our balance sheet transactions in various currencies and the results -- the overall results in the fourth -- in the third quarter was not a material amount, and you'll see that in the Q that will be released, hopefully, tomorrow. Turning on -- turning to the cash that we are -- that we're discussing and we'll be discussing more with the board tomorrow, there are a number of programs that we are looking at and a number of opportunities to return cash to shareholders that is kind of premature at this stage as the board will be in discussions on this point tomorrow. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. If I can just follow up on the FX piece in terms of -- less so on the balance sheet transactions but more so, let's say, on dollar-based raw materials in foreign countries and finished goods and things like that. Is that something where you think that can have a meaningful impact on some of the international profitability, again, given some of the swings you're having in these currencies? Thomas J. Kelly: It hasn't to date, and we don't anticipate that it will to any significant degree. You're talking, in the quarter, of a foreign exchange loss in basically of the order of $1 million that was expensed against the income statement. Operator : Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : [indiscernible] additional growth in the third quarter; 14%, pretty solid. It looks like EMEA was a little bit softer but you had very good growth from Japan, Asia Pacific and Brazil. So can you just talk about maybe some of the underlying market trends that you're seeing in some of your key European markets. And then how much benefit you're seeing in markets like Japan's, where you've had some of the innovations rollout and whether there was any timing benefit in that number. And then I guess on a longer-term basis, I know we've talked about the Coke partnership enabling you to become more profitable in international markets. But just wanted to see if you can give us any, kind of, road map as to how quickly you can envision the profitability ramping up in those markets once the deal closes? Rodney C. Sacks: The international markets are quite a mixed bag. While the growth, obviously, was slower in EMEA, overall, there were some markets that were nice and then some markets faced some competition in some cases from some lower-priced entrees, for example, in South Africa. And the same thing even in South America. These results, again, were led by a number of countries, but there were countries within the region that were also softer and some of that is just to do with timing. In the case of France, if you look at the numbers, there was -- if you remember, at the end of last year, there was a buy-in before -- in advance of the introduction of a tax in France. And then during the quarter, there was a lower stockholding this quarter than had been compared to last year, where there was, sort of, an increased larger stockholding. So that affected the French results. So these are things that are making or resulting in our results being quite choppy. We're hoping that as we are able to go forward and as the brands get bigger and more established in these countries, that sort of influence from stockholding -- changes in stockholdings will continue to diminish. Again, some of the stockholding buy-ins and longer delivery times for some of the South American and Asian markets also affected the results, because we were -- if you also look at the stockholding levels and if you look at sales out, they remain healthy in a number of countries. We're positive, but if you look at the sales in at any one quarter, you may find that the results are actually negative. And so you've got to look at the actual underlying business. And while the trends remained solid, we are having this choppiness in some of the results from various countries. So we think that will start getting smoothed out better as we continue to become more -- both effective -- becoming more established in these different countries and also in many countries going into the Coke system. We don't really have a program yet. We're still at the very preliminary stages of actually understanding the Coke system. We need to be able to have discussions and meetings with various Coke bottlers. We need to achieve a consensus and agreement on margin -- the value chains and margins, and making decisions exactly when we're going to switch to which and in which countries. And that, at the moment, is a complicated matrix and we really can't, I think, speculate to that going forward. I don't know if you'd like to add anything on that, Hilton. Hilton H. Schlosberg: I just would like to -- yes, I'd like add to Judy about a comment on Europe, which was spot on, in fact. There was a destocking, we believe, that took place in July in Europe -- with our distribution partners in Europe. And that was quite -- that was quite noticeable. Rodney C. Sacks: I think that's all. You can see the numbers, obviously, you gain from the October numbers. Again, it's a single month but yet we have seen a pickup in October in Europe, particularly. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company. Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : My question has to do with your average net sales per case and the 2.5% growth that you saw in the third quarter. You mentioned price increases on the 24-ounce packaging. So I'm curious whether you could give us a sense for the balance between pricing and mix, in terms of that 2.5% growth in average net sales per case? Hilton H. Schlosberg: It's in the Q. The Q will be released, as I said, hopefully, within next 24 hours, if not, on Monday. So it's all there. Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. Then maybe a bigger picture question that relates to that metric. It's impressive the growth that you're seeing in your average net sales per case but at the same time, you're seeing consistent deceleration in terms of your net sales growth. So can you talk, kind of, high level how you think about the balance between volumes versus pricing and mix? And how important it is for you guys to generate outsized volume growth because the 5% growth that you saw this quarter is the weakest that we've seen in a number of years. Hilton H. Schlosberg: I think that's actually a situation that is relating to where the market has been and where the market is going. We spoke a little bit about where the October numbers are, and the growth in October. At this time, we're not planning to have any price increases on our major [ph] product lines, but that, in fact, may change as we move forward into next year. So from our perspective on pricing, it's steady as she goes. We'll be absorbing the Coca-Cola transaction early in 2015. That's a concentrate model and that will affect average pricing as well. So I hope that answered your question, but I'm not sure what specific issue you were getting at. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. Continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we are going -- we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products comprised of our Monster Energy drink line together with The Coca-Cola Company's energy brands. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled and the caffeine content of the Monster is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, less than 0.5 milligrams per ounce of the caffeine labels contained in Starbucks and other coffee house brewed coffee. In other words, a medium Starbucks 16-ounce sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same sized Monster Energy drink. More than 12 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin. Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014 as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed November 7, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 26, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 13 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 13 years. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership with worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to The Coca-Cola Company. Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution with Coca-Cola Bottlers into additional territories. The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strengths of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. We are actively engaged in preparations for the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with respect to the transactions expired on October 15 2014, and in addition, all necessary approvals and consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained. In accordance with this existing agreements with applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors in the U.S. providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights are expected to be transitioned to Coca-Cola's distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third-party's rights in such territory. We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights from Monster to such bottlers. The closing of the transactions is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. Turning to the fourth quarter results. Throughout the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2015, the beverage industry, in general, has continued to show weakness. However, sales in the Energy Drink category appear to have accelerated, particularly in the U.S. towards the end of 2014 and into 2015. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $696.3 million, up 12.1% from $621.1 million. Net sales were $605.6 million, up 12% from $540.8 million. Our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew well in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole during the fourth quarter. Sales of Zero Ultra also continued to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter. Zero Ultra has become our second best selling item. At the end of the third quarter, we launched Ultra Sunrise, which was well received by retailers as well as consumers, and quickly became one of our top-performing SKUs. Sales of Java Monster also grew in the quarter. During 2014, we redesigned the graphics for our juice-based M-80 and Chaos energy drinks. Those products have been repositioned as our Juice Monster line. M-80 was renamed RIPPER, and the juice content was lowered, which has improved their drinkability. Sales of these products have showed healthy increases since this exercise was completed. Sales of our repositioned Punch Monster line have also increased. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 3.6 percentage points to 54.8% from 51.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw material as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating income was up 43.2% to $192.9 million from $134.8 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. During the fourth quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan, as compared to an operating loss from these operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $13.8 million in the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower in the quarter than last year. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year in dollars, in the quarter, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Results for the 2014 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $2.9 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with $4.7 million in the -- for the 2013 fourth quarter. Foreign currency losses during the fourth quarter decreased, primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Japan and South Africa. Our effective tax rate decreased from 42.2% to 34.7%, in the fourth quarter, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. Net income was $125.3 million, up 64.7% over net income of $76.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 63.2% to $0.72 from $0.44 in the 2013 comparable quarter. Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record growth sales of $2.8 billion for the 2014 full year, up 9.3% from $2.6 billion in 2013. Net sales were $2.5 billion, up 9.7% from $2.2 billion. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended 2013. Operating income was up 30.5% to $747.5 million from $572.9 million in 2013. Our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year as compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million in the same period the previous year. In the full year, expenses related to regulatory and litigation concerning our Monster Energy drinks were $20.6 million as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% in 2013 to 35.2% for the full 2014 year. Net income was $483.2 million, up 42.7% of a net income of $338.7 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $2.77 from $1.95 in 2013. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through January 24, 2015, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.6%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 4.2%; 5-Hour decreased by 3.8%; and AMP decreased by 10%. Sales of NOS increased by 38.8% and Full Throttle increased by 7.1%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, sales in the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 8.5% over the comparable period in 2014. Sales of Monster increased by 11.3% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 8.7% and NOS was up 42.4%. Rockstar was down 3.8%, 5-Hour was down 1.4%, and AMP was down 7.4%. According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 0.9 of 1 point over the comparable period last -- a year ago to 34.8% against Red Bull's share, which was level with Monster's at 34.8%. Rockstar's share was lower at 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower than 8.8%, while NOS' share was higher at 4.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 14.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot energy was 22.2% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 7, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were flat versus a year ago. Our market share decreased 1.4 points to 28.2% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased by 0.3 of 1 point to 36.2%. Rockstar's sales increased 24% and its market share increased 2.8 points to 18%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 9.7% in the month of December 2014. Monster sales increased 1.7% and market share decreased 2.6 points to 32.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 8.7% and its market share decreased by 4.8% to 23 -- 9 points to 23.7%. Drivet100 market share increased 10 points to 17.8%, while Boost's market share decreased by 0.1 of 1 point to 16.4%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together decreased 3.4 points to 6.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended January 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.8% in Great Britain, and from 17.4% to 18.3% in France. In the 13-week period ended December 2014, Monster's market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 8% to 10.9% in Germany; from 7.4% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 5.2% to 5.9% in The Netherlands; and from 8.1% to 8.7% in Sweden. Monster's market sharing value for the 13 weeks ended January 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.4% to 18% in South Africa, and from 21.7% to 21.2% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks through December 28, 2014 from 24.5% to 29.2% increase. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of January 2015, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 14.4% as compared to 9.4% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of January grew from 4.6% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of January 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 29% to 32.6%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 12.6% to $584.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $519.4 million in the same period in 2013. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 10.3% to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.1 billion in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 31.2% from $177.9 million to $232.5 million in the quarter and from $726.8 million to $908 million for the year. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.2% to $20.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $21.4 million for the same period in 2013 and decreased from $99.1 million for the 2013 year to $95.7 million for the full 2014 year. For the full year, contribution margin increased from a loss of $1 million in the prior year's fourth quarter to a profit of $0.8 million and from a loss of $1.7 million in 2013 to a profit of $3 million in 2014. For the 3-month ended December 31, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represent a 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 8% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in '13. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in the same period a year ago. Other sales are 2% for the period was the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2014 amounted to $160.1 million compared to $137.9 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2014 in dollars were 17.5% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. Overall, our Western European and Africa divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and into 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during both the third and fourth quarters of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 11.1% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America decreased 17.1% over the comparable 2013 fourth quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Columbian distributor. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets, although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the third quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We are planning to produce Monster in India shortly. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were 4.1% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.3% in the quarter versus 10.8% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. TDM MAT program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. General and administrative expenses decreased 3.3%, although payroll costs were slightly higher, including general and administrative costs in the quarter was $1.2 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. During the 2014 fourth quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $370.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $781.1 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased from $9.8 million to $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, and 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 as compared to 40.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $174.6 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 57.4 days at December 31, 2014, which was lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. As discussed on the last call, we are currently in the process of launching Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy. Due to the strong response we received to our 2014 summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have converted that item into a permanent SKU in existing countries, in which it is being sold and are planning to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. Gross sales in January 2015, were 11.2% higher than in January 2014. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points North American international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 fourth quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the Energy category continues to grow and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 are gaining market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers during 2014 and both distribution and sales of those lines are improving. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines will continue to increase their contribution to sales throughout 2015. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, The Netherlands and Chile. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Just trying to understand some of the drivers on the top line and sustainability, I think you alluded to at the Analyst Day that lower gas prices were having a benefit, but didn't know if there was seeing that accelerate as we move through the quarter and into this quarter, are if there's anything else? And then also on the Coke partnership now that you've sent out the termination letters, can you kind of give us an idea around the world, are you largely going with a Coke by network, are there some exceptions. Is it 80-20? Just trying to get an idea about that? Rodney C. Sacks: Just to deal with the gas prices. I don't think there's been a change since we really discussed it last time. And in fact, you're seeing a little bit of an increase in gas prices. For us -- to say anything more, just be speculative. With regard to the transition, I think it's premature for us at this stage to go -- I think that all would be to ready to say that we have sent out notices to probably the majority, of the AB distributors in the U.S., it's not to all the distributors. We are still negotiating with a number of international distributors and I just think at this point, it would be sensitive and premature to go into more detail on that. But obviously, the idea as we've indicated, in general, when there will be exceptions, will be to move to the Coke system. Operator : Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Quick question. If you can give us an idea, I guess, 2 questions. If you can give us an idea in terms of the impact of FX on the international numbers in the fourth quarter, and then it seems as though FX is probably fully baked in the January numbers. So it would seem as though that the underlying growth actually probably accelerated a little bit if you exclude FX, so can you give us a little bit of an idea in terms of how the FX is impacting the top line numbers? And then can you talk a little bit about the change in the international profitability levels, how much of that is coming from, let's say more local production versus how much is coming from the more efficient spending that you guys have talked about over the last 12 months internationally? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that the earnings change, impact has probably been -- overall probably being about a percent or a little less. We think that again, it's probably going to be of that order going in the first quarter. But again, we're not sure. I just -- I think that at this point, we should speculate on the first quarter going forward, more on that. So your second question? Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Quick question on operating leverage. We saw a pretty solid operating leverage, favorable leverage here. Can you talk about what's driving that and as you absorb some of Coca-Cola's Energy brand, should we expect that to accelerate even more from this level? Rodney C. Sacks: I didn't hear the last part, did we expect? Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Canada : As you absorb Coca-Cola's Energy brands, are you expect it to be even higher from our operating leverage perspective? And then a tax rate question as well. As you grow profitability in the international market, should we continue to expect tax rate to come down? Hilton H. Schlosberg: So the acquisition of the Coca-Cola brand will be a concentrated model. So it'll be very different to the finished goods model that the company operates at this time. And the Coca-Cola brand that coming into the company will be shown as a separate segment in our financials. So when you talk about operating leverage, the basis of the structure of the income statement will be very different between the 2 entities, because in one case, we sell the finished goods. And in the other case, Coke sells a concentrate, which we'll continue selling the concentrate. Operator : Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I think John's question was really more my question, which is really related to the international profitability ramp up that you've seen in the last few quarters. Is there way you can give us a little bit color on how much of that is coming from the local production versus some of the selling expense leverage that you're seeing from the investments that you've made and the scale that you're getting in those markets? And then my second question is specific to Asia. I think your sales were up 11.4%. You talked about positive performance in Japan. It is a slowdown from the last quarter, where I think you had 70% plus growth. So a little bit more color just in terms of specifically to Asia was FX a big impact. What are you seeing in terms of the underlying performance in Japan and any other major markets in Asia that you're seeing some traction? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that the improved profitability is coming from both, and I don't think -- we don't have the breakup available to provide to you at this point, Judy. With regard to Asia, the results in Japan continued to do well. We did have some slowdown in some of the other countries. In the last quarter, Australia was lower, and that offset the increase somewhat. Just to add a little bit of color, Judy, on your first question. Remember that in Europe, improvement in operating performance there is -- there has been no change because we have been producing locally for some time. So it's only in Japan that we have recommenced production that has obviously impacted positively the numbers in Japan. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : So 2 quick ones for me. The acceleration in the category that we're seeing in the U.S., can you kind of point to what you think, other than lower oil prices, might be driving some of the balance that we see in the category? And then second unrelated question. Cash investments is building on the balance sheet. You guys haven't bought back stock recently, but I guess, that's sort of the expectation once the Coke deal closes. Can you talk about your decision not to buyback stock and what we should expect? Rodney C. Sacks: I think that the acceleration is really -- there is a slightly improved feeling generally in the U.S. and petrol prices are down, the gas prices are down. But other than that, we've just seen that, that bounce back and as we've indicated, it doesn't seem to be followed through in all categories of beverages. Hilton H. Schlosberg: On the second point, Kevin. We with the inflow of funds from the Coca-Cola transaction, the board is examining or will be examining various ways to return that cash to stockholders. And we've been pretty consistent about that for some time since the deal was announced. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to ask about the disruption in the business from a transition of distribution standpoint. So you sent out the letters earlier this month, so it's been a few weeks since then. So I'm curious what you're -- or what the reaction has been in terms of in-stock out-of-stock that sort of thing? And then broadly before that, obviously, a lot of the distributors knew it was coming. And so could you talk about whether there was any impact in the December, quarter month of January, has it accelerated, as speculation has mounted in sort of not just what the impact has been, but how do you maintain the focus here as you go into end of March on a transition? Rodney C. Sacks: We took steps at the offset to communicate with the AB Distributors, and gave them certain assurances regarding inventory purchases that we would repurchase, they wouldn't get stuck with inventory. Also, you will appreciate that their are severance fee is dependent on their sales in the 12 months, immediately preceding the termination. So it is in their interest, obviously, to continue increasing their sales out in order to maximizing their own severance payments, and we felt that by giving them the assurance that we would pick up all or buyback all several inventories that there was no reason for them to start trying to rationalize their inventory or try and cut down and only focus on the main SKUs and not carry the supporting brands. And we've had -- we think we had a good effect. This correspondence had a good effect. And we've really not experienced any noticeable disruption from the AB Distributors as compared to our other distributors. I think that continued to perform nicely, you can see that from the results and we are not seeing any despair or differences between the AB Distributors on the one side and Coke distributors or some of the independence on the other side. The trend that we had from these distributors before the notice has continued into the fourth quarter and continued even in the first couple of 2 months of this year. So we aren't seeing that, we are being able to manage that reasonably comfortably. Going forward, obviously, we will see how that goes. We're hoping that by giving the AB Distributors quite a lot of notice, being able to manage these inventory issues and pick up issues, will enable us to also make sure inventory is in place at the Coke plants and at the Coke branches so that when the change over occurs, they will be ready to go with the inventory as well. So we obviously are trying to minimize the disruption that will occur at that point in time. And it will occur slightly, at a slightly different dates, it's not -- the lot of principal dates are probably closer to the early April, there are dates that take place at different times. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Hilton, can I just ask one follow-up? You said that the board is going to make a determination, about what to do with the cash at some point in time. Is that going to be before or after you have 2 Coke appointees on the board? Hilton H. Schlosberg: Well, the board can't make a decision, I would believe, until the cash comes into the company. So we have to wait for the close to make a final decision, a final determination. And I imagine that the 2 Coke appointees will be part of that decision. The board's been considering it and continues to do so. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : A couple of questions. The fourth quarter profits in the United States were bigger than the third quarter for the first time I've ever seen. And I'm just wondering if there was any sort of overshipment of anticipation of any other change over that happened at that point? Or, in fact, you had the acceleration in growth rate in the fourth quarter and if you look at 11% in January, that's actually a slight deceleration. So was there anything going on in the fourth quarter that inflated U.S. profits? Hilton H. Schlosberg: Just lower expenses. There were no, there were absolutely -- there's no issue with product in any quarter not been related to that quarter. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And would the -- is the lower profit, there wasn't anything onetime -- I'm sorry, the lower expense, there's nothing onetime about that, that we're going to have to lack next year? Rodney C. Sacks: I'm just looking right now. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And then while you're looking, if I might just ask, when you -- when Coke's deal is finished, and you look at territories where you already have full distribution, like CCE or the U.S. where you are fully distributed, but now you'll be a Coke brand and a Coke system, do you anticipate an acceleration of growth just as a result of the whole system being firmly behind you? Are there opportunities for an acceleration and growth from that? Hilton H. Schlosberg: We've been consistent, we've actually said there would be. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Can you tell us how? Rodney C. Sacks: Well, we think that there is an alignment, there's an alignment with them on their own brands in each country now as we go forward. There is a -- a longer term, I think commitment where we will be -- our brands, and we as a company, I think will be viewed as part of the group and as part of the longer term, the brands are also will be viewed as more. As part of the longer-term plans. I think outside of the system, I think even the bottlers and distributors have a much shorter horizon for -- vision for the brands. And so I think, they restrict some of their capital investments and efforts, because they just have a different attitude to the brand. We think that we will have a for -- mal focus on cooler programs and vending on those are the things and some of the specialty accounts where they go into key accounts, we will be part of that now those were things that we really didn't ever really participate in before. Hilton H. Schlosberg: And I think one of the big things as well, if I may just add one comment to what Rodney said, which is correct, was the fact that we now control their inventory brand. I think will enable us to prevent a certain degree of duplication, a certain degree of possible retaliation from one brand to the other. So we'll be able to manage those brands as a system. And then, Karen, I looked at your -- we quickly did a review, Tom and I, and I can't see anything that particularly hits as a one-off issue in the quarter. There seemed to be numbers that really pretty consistent there. Obviously, the only thing that comes up from time-to-time but there's nothing material that I could even put my finger on. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products comprised of our Monster Energy drink line, together with The Coca-Cola Company's Energy brands, and in particular, NOS, which grew its sales and market share in the United States in 2014. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business, while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 2, 2015, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 7, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster, which, in turn, will transfer its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained. In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date, Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015. Thus far, such transitions were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition, both on Monster's and Coke's respective teams. We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015. We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company Energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return cash to our shareholders. Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted domestically by events relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions. At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 first quarter, as reported, was $626.8 million. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales. After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Excluding distributed termination costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and MAT program costs were lower during the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and distributed termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year. Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration deferred revenue as well as distributed termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014. Results for the 2015 first quarter continue to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year. Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also, additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options. If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014. On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014. The effective regulatory-related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Included in geographic sales reported are our sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%; sales of 5-Hour increased by 0.4%; and AMP decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of Full Throttle increased 4.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 10.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.3% over the same period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.5%. NOS was up 21.8%; Rockstar was up 13.2%; 5-Hour was up 1.3%; and AMP was down 17%. We do want to point out that increased processing as well as the trading-up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increasing revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking up processing of our products later this year. According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's share was up point -- 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%, while NOS' was higher at 3.9%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 17.1% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just want to point out that we are cycling on a lot of innovation that we introduced the first quarter last year. Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26%, and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%. Another note is that it's just timing of promotions. We will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors' promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5%, and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%. Vive 100's market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%. Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.8% to 9.2% in Sweden; from 5% to 5.6% in the Netherlands; and from 21.2% to 21.3% in Spain. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% in Greece. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased 10% to $566 million, and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter. Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- I'm sorry, by $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of 2015. During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from Mega Monster. Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor, sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March increased for Nielsen. In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets but have deferred proposed launches in certain countries in the -- for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transactions. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy. Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to perform well and experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed, and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, however, sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter of last year and, obviously, negatively impacted our sales. During the 2015 first quarter, no share purchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. However, 20 -- I'm sorry, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were at 46.4 days at March 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014. We have now launched Ultra Citron, our fruity SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time. We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by the Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to comment thereon at this time. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve. We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, particularly a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So I guess just first in terms of the 84% of the volume that you've transitioned to the Coke distribution, just give us a little bit of kind of what you're seeing as you've transitioned. I know you called out some of the disruptions, but are you starting to see some changes in terms of what's happening on the shelves? And you've obviously highlighted the opportunity in the vending and specialty channels. Can we see those channels getting more traction more quickly? And then in international market, it sounds like the disruptions related to just the pending transition is perhaps a little bit more pronounced maybe than the U.S. markets. So can you verify if that is the appropriate reads that we should think about at this point? And are there any sort of any big markets? You're seeing a little bit more of the transition disruption in those international markets? Rodney C. Sacks: Judy, with your second question first. I think you are correct in that assumption. I think international markets have just been a little more affected. I think there's just a little more skepticism amongst the distributors and anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to be -- distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales and, in general approach, I think in attitude. With regard to the transition to the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where retailers hadn't -- weren't able in time to make changes or the distributor to make changes, so that, in some cases, products being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors, so there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small -- a few instances, but obviously, we don't hear of everything, certainly not in the first few weeks of it taking place. So I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, is going to take some months to pan out and be -- for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think would not be sensible and not accurate enough. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : The first question, the price increase, should we think about that as sort of in line with the mid-single-digit price increase that Red Bull took? Rodney C. Sacks: I think it's probably going to be similar, yes. I just think that having seen how they've managed this and the effect and the response from the trade and consumers, we think that's probably what we are likely to do. We'll finalize the actual numbers a little later, but we'll do that. We're looking to try and do that early in the fall. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then the tax rates, so should we expect also that to go back to where it was trending over the last year or so following this quarter? And then just one sort of broader question... Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. It's hard for us to determine what the tax rate would be. But we -- there was a -- there was this factor. This was quite a large stock option exercise that might've -- there maybe some that flow through. But then eventually, on a longer-term basis, those will ameliorate quite substantially. That will affect the tax rate. And I think as we continue to settle down and grow international business, both for our own brand as well as the brand, the KO acquired brands, we think that the tax rate will be positively affected. But we -- at this point, we just -- there's too many uncertainties for us to try and point to exactly where that will end up. But we do think we will be able to make some headway in lowering the rate. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then just lastly, how are you envisioning international distribution in terms of percent of volume in the Coke system and away from the Coke system? I know it's early, but just sort of how do you think about that? Rodney C. Sacks: Again, I think that's been really difficult to give you an answer on because it's just taken time to get to meet the international bottlers around the world to assess their appetite, where we will be with them, what their appetite is for the brand. And there are also, obviously, economic issues and factors as to whether we are happy making the change, if -- based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors, and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition in -- to do in mass clearly and was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses, we've been -- to visit them, we've traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And it's -- and each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies. There isn't a one formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time, and we're going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as -- on a positive point of view, we would like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Question on G&A. So OpEx in the quarter was a little bit higher than we had modeled, and I understand there's some noise in there, regulatory professional services, et cetera. Should that normalize? I guess the thinking was you'd get better SG&A leverage, particularly with the top line pretty resilient. Should we be expecting G&A to sort of normalize for the balance of the year? And then with respect to FX, perhaps you could give us a little guidance there. I guess it was about a 2 point headwind in the top line. What are you expecting for the balance of the year? Rodney C. Sacks: Just on the G&A, I think that the regulatory side will eventually go, but it is there. We're going to see that for a little while still until we resolve some of these -- the pending regulatory matters. With regard to the payroll taxes, again, we think that there may be 1 or 2 quarters, but that generally will also I think regulate -- might disappear and become much more normalized. One of the other costs that we -- or a couple of the other costs that I would just mention, that I did mention, the premiums was high this quarter. What happened was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch in when you're going to see the benefit of it, but is this the right -- we needed to account with an accordance with our policies. Also, in the -- in sponsorships, there was a -- there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What -- in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we -- our contracts with the -- particular events. Now we are amortizing those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards -- the annual events start towards the second quarter or earlier than that -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase in -- we signed an agreement, a sort of major sponsorship with UFC this year, which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those -- again, we think those will normalize somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects will -- those will all be effective once we obviously bring in the KO brands with -- because the whole model for the KO brands will be a concentrate model. There'd be different cost criteria, and that may change things up a little bit. Hilton H. Schlosberg: And one thing we didn't actually address is the professional services costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction. And of course, that should wind down when the transaction closes. Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. Absolutely. And then ForEx, perhaps if you'd like to comment on, the floor is yours. Your thoughts on that, Hilton? Hilton H. Schlosberg: Yes. ForEx, in the quarter, we commented that gross sales we believe were affected by about USD 15 million and the net sales by USD 12 million. And depending on what happens in the subsequent quarters, it's difficult to comment on what those numbers will look like going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from EMO Capital Markets (sic) [BMO Capital Markets]. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : Rodney, if we look like 12 to 18 months in the future and then you look at your international business, what are some of the key markets that you're focusing on? And as we look at the time line of getting traction in those markets, should we assume a normalized time line or a little bit accelerated now that you have a partner of large scale in some of those markets? Rodney C. Sacks: Well, the major international markets that we sort of already are in the with large enough, and I'd say, major sort of Energy Drink markets are U.K. and Europe, Germany, where we're in now, Spain, so we are -- we're continuing to focus in those markets. Those markets won't -- obviously GB and Spain are with the same Coca-Cola Bottlers. We -- obviously, Germany isn't at the moment, and that will be a decision on -- if and when we change in Germany, which is likely and imminent. The opportunities also in the other big markets, which are sort of -- as a market but we don't know the size of the Energy category for probably premium. The market is very big for -- in Energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really big -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain and we've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we're doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we're already there. And then obviously, newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but it wouldn't be as much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain when we can get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet with all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system. It's not a matter of getting together with a half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs. And then just important to also get them more aligned with us to be real partners and produce locally and -- as well as sell locally. So -- production has its own issues, and we need to deal with those things. That just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there, and we believe it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way. Thomas J. Kelly: I mean, that was one of the reasons why we did this transaction was to be able to capitalize on the opportunities that Coca-Cola presents to us through international distribution. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, maybe a follow-up on that just with regards to your progress moving to local production in overseas markets. We've talked a lot about it, and you just mentioned it there. I just was wondering if there's any update to your thinking just given the Coke deal is pending. I guess, specifically, are you now holding back on that transition anywhere where you instead anticipate a move to local production via the Coke system instead of your current... Rodney C. Sacks: No. It's -- again, it's a mixed bag, and there are clearly more opportunities to get local production through the Coke bottlers that we have talked to and we anticipate talking to. In some countries, we were very advanced in discussions with independent Coke packers to actually pack our products. And in some cases, we need to and we will continue with those arrangements and implement them because a, it'll help secure local production on a -- at a quicker date because it does take some time to get a Coke-packing plant up to speed and to make certain equipment changes that might be necessary or was usually necessary in order to run our products. And in some case in countries, there may well be a need for backup or 2 production plants. So again, it depends on the country. It depends on the circumstances, but there is a really good appetite from the Coke bottlers who are enthusiastic about wanting to do production and -- which is very beneficial for us. So we are reviewing and running down dual policies in some countries where 2 -- the independent packers that we already started on, plus Coke packers, and then in other countries, just looking -- starting from a fresh with Coke -- with the Coke packers or Coke bottlers. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in our company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we are -- that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of Energy Drink products comprised of our Monster Energy Drink line, together with The Coca-Cola Company's energy brands throughout the world. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core Energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company finally closed on June 12, 2015. Under the agreement, The Coca-Cola Company acquired an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company also transferred ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster and Monster in turn transferred its non-energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. We are excited about our partnership and believe that it will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We are now actively engaged in implementing our strategic alignment and have commenced discussions with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries around the world. Our first international transition to a Coca-Cola bottler was accomplished in Germany in early July. There are a number of hurdles to be overcome, both legal and financial, in finalizing the award of distribution rights to new international bottlers. We intend to continue to manage The Coca-Cola energy business, which we refer to our as our strategic brands, as a Concentrate business as The Coca-Cola Company did prior to the closing of the transactions. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our Monster Energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Under our historical Finished Products model, we sell Finished Products to our distributors. Under the Concentrate model, Concentrate and/or beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. As a result, we have revised our reportable statements to reflect management's view of the business. In this quarter, we report on three operating and reportable segments. First is the Finished Products segment, the principal product of which include the company's Monster Energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Second is Concentrate, the principal product of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. And the third is Other, the principal product of which include the brands disposed-off as a result of The Coca-Cola transactions, including those which were previously comprised the majority of the former warehouse segment and the Peach Tea brand. We are endeavoring to accelerate the pace of our negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers with a view to be able to transition a number of additional international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the future. Sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements. The impact of the transitions of a substantial majority of our Monster distribution rights in the United States earlier this year, the lower inventory levels maintained by Coca-Cola bottlers versus the Anheuser-Busch distributors, and the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of The Coca-Cola network, given the anticipated implementation of the transactions, all negatively affected our sales growth during the second quarter. Both the Nielsen numbers, which reflect retail sales to consumers, as well as distributed depletions, which reflect sales out by distributors and bottlers to their customers, were substantially less affected by the transition. Results during the second quarter were also negatively affected by out-of-stocks, which occurred in certain geographies due to the learning curve associated with the transitions to The Coca-Cola network. Also the transition has progressed relatively smoothly in the United States; there is always some disruption when transitioning distribution. This learning curve is not dissimilar to what we experienced when we transitioned a large part of our distribution in the United States to The Coca-Cola bottlers some six years ago. But it was temporary. They got up to speed relatively quickly and we believe that the same will occur here. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in this quarter. We believe it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. Gross sales for the 2015 second quarter were $789.9 million compared to gross sales of $779 million in the comparable second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 second quarter were $693.7 million as compared to $687.2 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $29.9 million on gross sales and approximately $23.9 million on net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 56.9% as compared to 55.2% for the comparable 2014 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment as well as changes in product sales mix and lower cost of raw materials. Excluding distributor termination costs of $12.2 million and transaction expenses of $11.5 million, operating expenses for the 2015 second quarter were $166.1 million as compared to $161.9 million in the same quarter last year, excluding termination costs of $0.5 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding these items were 23.9% for the 2015 second quarter as compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2015 second quarter compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.4% compared to 10.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Commissions and royalties in the quarter were lower, partly offset by a $1.6 million provision for marketing funds for the new Coca-Cola energy business and an increase of $3.6 million in sponsorships and endorsements. General and administrative costs excluding distributor termination costs and the transaction costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 second quarter were 9.5% as compared to 8.6% for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $8.4 million, due to additional payroll taxes paid by the company following the exercise of certain stock options by senior management, as well as the addition of certain employees to manage and service the new strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. Payroll taxes were $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.6 million last year in the same quarter, an increase of $4.8 million. Total transactional costs related to The Coca-Cola transactions during the second quarter were $11.5 million as compared to $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $187.2 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $180.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $151.3 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $148 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $29.9 million and on net sales of approximately $23.9 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 25, 2015 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased by 10.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 14.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 14.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 13%, sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1% and sales of Amp decreased 5.8%. According to Nielsen for the four-weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased 10.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.1% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 11.5% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 13.5%, Rockstar was up 21.7%, 5-Hour was up 4.8% and Amp was up 0.4%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 25, 2015, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 0.5 points over the same period last year to 34.2%. NOS' share remained the same at 3.8% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull share increased 0.9 points to 36.3%. Rockstar share was up 0.7 points at 7.6%. 5-Hour share was lower at 8.6% and Amp's share decreased 0.2 points to 2.2%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.9% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 9.1% higher. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 27, 2015, the energy drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 6% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.4 points to 27.8% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.8 points to 38.2%. Rockstar sales increased 37% and its market share increased 4.1 points to 19.2%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 20.4% in the month of June 2015. Monster sales increased 1.1%. Our market share decreased 6.2 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Our strategic brands market share represented by Burn increased 0.3 points to 6.2%. Gladiator has been discontinued in Mexico. Red Bull sales increased 4.3% and its market share decreased by 3.2 points to 20.9%. VIVE 100's market share increased 7.8 points to 21.7%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 14.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. In the month prior, which is May 2015, for example, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 28.7% in the month and Monster's sales increased 25.6%. Our market share decreased 0.9 points to 35.3% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 0.8% and its market share decreased by 6.1 points to 20.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 6.5 points to 19.6%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.8 points to 13.9%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 1.1 points to 6.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew some 10.5% to 12.4% in Great Britain, from 15.8% to 18.7% in France, and from 7.6% to 11.5% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.9% to 8.7% in Sweden, from 8.2% to 8.8% in Belgium, and from 5.9% to 6% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ended June 2015, as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.7% to 16.8% in South Africa and from 22.4% to 21.9% in Spain, and from 11.7% to 11.2% in Italy. All three of these markets had independent distributors. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13-weeks to the end of June 2015 from 25.4% to 27.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, for the month of May 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.6% as compared to 11.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of June 2015 declined from 5.3% to 3.9% as compared to the same period last year. We believe that our distributor in Brazil has lost focus on our brand as a result of The Coca-Cola transaction. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of June 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 24.1% to 32.7%. Additionally, within the last few weeks, Monster launched its Monster Energy Ultra energy drink in Japan. Early indications are very positive. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into Finished Products, Concentrate, and Other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment or the DSD segment, but excluding Peach Tea, increased 1.2% to $651.2 million, and operating income for the Finished Products segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts decreased 1.1% to $251.6 million in the 2015 second quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $22.8 million of foreign currency movements, and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of distributed terminations. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, and operating income before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts for the Concentrate segment was $9.1 million. You will appreciate that that covers the period only \u2013 between the closing of the transaction and the end of the quarter, which is not a full quarter. Net sales for the company's third segment, Other, decreased 32.6% to $29.5 million for the three months ended June 2015 from $43.8 million for the same period ending June 30, 2014. The 2015 second quarter's results for the Other segment are through June 12, the date The Coca-Cola transaction closed. Operating income for the Other segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts and excluding the gain on the sale of our non-energy business was $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2015 in dollars were 4.8% higher than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 32% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 10% higher in dollars and 38% higher in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. However, growth in Spain, South Africa, and Italy were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of The Coca-Cola transaction. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we've made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution and traded profitably in the second quarter. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented over the past two years. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of the markets in Europe and South Africa continues to perform well. During the quarter, we launched Mega Monster in additional EMEA markets. Results continue to be positive. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Poland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. In our international markets where our distribution partners anticipated transition occurring, there is a notable difference in our sales levels versus our markets that are already operating in The Coca-Cola system. Net sales in Asia Pacific increased 28.7%, a 49.9% increase in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean decreased 3.5% in dollars but increased 5.8% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014 mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax, and continuing issues with our Colombian distributor. Sales in Brazil for the second quarter were disappointing, as referred to earlier. In Japan, net sales increased by 41.8% in dollars and 66.5% in local currency. In Mexico, net sales were flat both in local currency and dollars. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the division in the second quarter of 2015. India has been impacted by losses in the second quarter following regulatory issues which are currently being addressed. We're actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating many additional local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers which we believe will yield cost reductions. We have experienced a decrease in sales of Muscle Monster that we believe is principally attributable to a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster products. I did mention this on our previous call. We have addressed the issue by reformulating those products and are currently shipping new Muscle Monster products with new graphics to our distributors. Following the confirmation of the transactions with The Coca-Cola Company, the company received substantial cash funds. The Board of Directors is considering options with regard to the return of capital, including share repurchases. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.7 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.2 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments increased to $52.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.2 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 42.6 days at June 30, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.5 days at June 30, 2014. Inventories increased to $180.9 million from $174.6 million December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 54.4 days at June 30, 2015, which was lower than the 37.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 60.8 days at June 30, 2014. In the fall, we are planning to launch a new Juice Monster called Pipeline Punch and a new banana-flavored Muscle Monster as well as Monster Ultra Black as a permanent SKU. We have also reformulated our Rojo Tea + Energy Rehab product as a Raspberry Tea + Energy product, which is currently in the process of being introduced. We have additional new product launches planned for the beginning of 2016. Our repositioned Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to show healthy gains. Gross sales in July 2015 in dollars were approximately 14.1% higher than in July 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in July were 19.2% higher than in July 2014. July 2014 included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. Specifically, the Finished Product segment, which comprises our Monster Energy brand products, grew 10.2% in July in dollars and 14.5% without a foreign exchange impact. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We are pleased that The Coca-Cola transaction closed on June 12 and are excited with the opportunity this presents to the company. North American and international gross margins are healthy and, in fact, have continued to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category continues to grow. We believe that the majority of the increases in dollar values achieved by Red Bull are attributable to their price increase which they implemented in January. In units, sales of Red Bull in the United States increased by 5.5%, which is lower than the 9.1% increase in units achieved by Monster. We think that the resilience shown by consumers to Red Bull's increased pricing augurs well for our planned price increase in September. Importantly, on a unit basis, Monster continues to outperform Red Bull this year, which we believe is significant. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced last year continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. We believe that our Monster Ultra lines and additions and changes to our Rehab and Juice Monster lines will continue to add to sales. Turning to international markets, we are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, Greece, and Chile. We are pleased with the improvement in July in our sales growth. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Hello, Judy. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So if I look at your second quarter international trends, and I think you talked about local currency growth in some of the markets like EMEA and Japan, it actually looks very healthy despite some of the transition issues that you called out in a few of the markets. So, number one, can you just talk about what's driving some of that underlying improvement? Maybe it's the Coke System doing better or it's some of the new markets you're entering? And then even the improvement that you saw in July, what's driving that? And then the markets that you're having some challenges, like Brazil and Italy and maybe even other markets that were having discussions about the transition, can you elaborate on how much progress you're making? What are some of the early learnings as you're talking to these bottlers and thinking about the pace in which you can transition some of the bottlers to the Coke System? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Let me take the last question first. In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is, you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that their territories will ultimately be transitioned to Coke. So what they've generally have really pulled back on their investments in their markets, in investing in putting extra effort. And although we've tried to obviously work with them and assure them and it effects their buyout to some extent, they really mentally are not in the same place as they were when they were fully engaged as our full-time distributors. So the challenge we've got is in basically being able to conclude arrangements with the Coke bottlers as soon as possible to transition those markets. And we've referred to that there is a learning curve with the international Coke bottlers, not only from a point of view of learning about our products, but the way we go to the market, the way we operate, the terms of our agreements using a Finished Product model, all of these things are not usual generally to the Coke bottlers. They have very different business models and existing contractual relationships with The Coca-Cola Company. So there are some complex issues both with regard to the legal terms of the agreements and the economics and working out the value chains. And these are being done and attended to and we are having these discussions, but it is taking some time. And unfortunately, we've just got to be patient. But what we do clearly see is there is a very big difference in both our sales in and sales out from distributors to please their depletions in markets where they are what we call non-transition markets where the distributors know that they are going to stay with the brand, for example, the Coke, the CCR markets in Europe. Those markets are generally performing well and performing at a much higher level than the markets where there is a likelihood of a transition. There are some markets, on the other hand, where we've not made a decision to transition, and we've communicated that and been able to assure our distributor. Those markets are performing well, particularly you call out a market like Japan where our partner has \u2013 we've talked with them and we're focused on continuing to operate with them and there, the market has done very well and they are continuing to perform fully. That is in international. I mean that is not a dissimilar situation in the U.S. If you take our markets in the U.S. with it in some cases, in most cases, our existing Coke bottlers, but in some cases we have some independent bottlers here, distributors or bottlers. And, again, you're seeing a clear difference between the results of both our sales in and the sales in were obviously also affected by the lower stock holding levels held by Coke bottlers versus the AB, the new ones we've gone to here. That was an additional factor. But even if you take that into account or put it to the side for the moment, when you look at the depletions by the Coke bottlers in the transition territories, the depletions are lower than in the same company's non-transition territories. And it's clear that what's going on is that there is a learning curve. There were some out of stocks both from our side and in retail, but it's also a learning curve because the new sales teams have basically got to learn the Monster business, the velocities, those accounts that are higher in velocity don't necessarily replicate the accounts that are higher in velocity for traditional beverages. And so we think that that's a transitory thing and this is the quarter where they've gone through it. It's the first 90 days of the transition to the Coke System in the U.S. And so we think these are things that are just going to have to work their way out of it. And we believe we're starting to see improvements and some of that is now being reflected in the numbers that we're showing in our sales numbers for July. But obviously what you also can see is, if you look at the Nielsen over this whole period, the Nielsen numbers in the U.S. have been pretty consistent on our sales out in units, et cetera, which shows that from the consumer point of view, there is still similar retail pull in all these markets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess just two questions. One is sort of a follow up on the last one. If you could talk maybe about directionally, did the July number benefit from restock? Or did you see more of that in, call it, months of May and June, and so the July number is more of a representation of demand? I guess you could see that from the scanner data, but maybe if you could give us a bit of commentary on that, that'd be helpful. And then secondly on cash, I appreciate your commentary from a board standpoint, but $3 billion in cash is obviously an awful lot. So what prevents you from going into the market, call it, Monday, Tuesday, whenever the window opens up next week, to buy back a lot of stock? Or how should we sort of think about the share repurchases? Is it going to be in open market for some period of time? Will there be an ASR tender? If you could just sort of help us directionally on that, that'd be great too. Thank you. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, Mark, if I could answer that question on cash there, there will be a return of cash to shareholders. The board is meeting tomorrow and it's one of the issues that will be tabled on the board meeting. And I can't say what route the board will take, but there are certainly a number of options open to the board and they will make their decision in due course. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. It's obviously clear that we have the excess cash, and we will address it, but we need to address it in due course. There are a number of reasons as to what we need to do or how to do it and we will look at that, Mark. It's just premature at the moment. I know everybody is keen to get us to deal with it and address it, but it just has to be dealt with in due course. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And then your first question was about the July sales and I think there's a general view here that the stock reductions are past us and that the July sales really are a factor of demand. And that's a view, it's not something that one can take to the bank but it's certainly the view that we hold here. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. And we also think that that's being influenced by the fact that, again, some of that learning curve is now improving and some of the out of stocks that initially occurred because of unknown order patterns for different products in our line which has quite a lot of products. Those things have \u2013 we think those are normalizing and we think that that is more indicative of our regular business. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And we have been having regular meetings with The Coca-Cola bottlers in the U.S. and these issues are being addressed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Only two questions. One, could you talk about what portion of your non-U.S. sales are going through non-Coca-Cola distributors at this time? And what's the level of decline with those? Any sort of help that would be great. And the second one is in non-U.S. markets where Coca-Cola does not have a contractual obligation to partner with you, unlike the U.S. market, are you seeing greater difficulty? Or it's just going through the process of finding out terms and conditions that are acceptable to both the parties? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: I think there is a general excitement amongst all of the Coke bottlers to take on Monster and to partner with us. And I think it's right through the Coke. I think there's a very good attitude throughout the Coke System. I think the issue is \u2013 as I indicated earlier, it's getting to be able to get them comfortable with the basis on which we do business which is different to the traditional Concentrate sort of model business that Coke has followed for centuries. And to get them to understand us and work through the legal issues such that we're getting through value chain issues. And generally to the extent that we've worked with them, they're all comfortable with the value chain issues that there are satisfactory ways in which we can work to share the issue and they're excited by that. It's a positive for them. But we obviously have to negotiate and get through everybody, trying to muscle each other at the moment to take a position which will obviously be (38:30) going forward. So we're just having to work through those issues. But we are hopeful that we'll get through in most of them. And if to the extent that we don't in any particular territory, we have options that we can go to. We have existing distributors, and a lot of the issues we are having with existing distributors if we were to not transition a territory and go back to those distributors and basically assure them that or give them a longer term contract and give them the assurance that they will have a longer term, that they have a number of years secured, we've got no doubt they will start to reinvest and re-engage in the brand. It's just that we've not been able to do that because we haven't wanted to mislead them or give them any false hopes. And so that's been the delicate tightrope we've been walking at the moment. So again, it doesn't mean that in every territory we will go to a Coke bottler. But I don't think that that is an issue. The issue at the moment is just getting everybody and it's time to deal in all these different countries and get everybody on the same page and get them comfortable with us. We are making progress. And we obviously are going to try and step up the pace of those negotiations. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. I think I just wanted to add that the decisions that will be made for international distribution will be decisions that will be the best for Monster, for our company, and that will be assessed following the negotiations, the value chains, legal issues and other opportunities which we may have. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Now, on the percentages, I would say that probably got the \u2013 probably pretty much the majority of our sales are with existing Coke bottlers internationally, pretty close to half, and if you look at the numbers in many places other than Japan which is an exception, in other places you've got sales very much down and Chile is also a good market as well in that sense. These bottlers are working well with the distributor, but in Brazil particularly it's been very disappointing. They're just really not engaged and some of the wholesalers they work with seem to have disengaged as well. And then in some of the markets which are non-Coke bottlers, when I say we're up, it's marginal, it's almost flat versus really nice healthy gains across the Coke bottler markets. So there is a very big distinction between those markets. But as to the percentage, I'm just guessing. I just don't have a number in my head or available at this point in time. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: More than 50 billion is probably a good... (41:24) Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. And then the one distributor that did perform pretty well, which was a distributor in Germany, they also did perform reasonably well until we changed over, but that was quite a large volume market which have now changed to Coke. And in the first month there, we've been very satisfied with the result. It's been very positive. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And in Mexico, the July sales were actually very good. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: And I should put Mexico into the same category as Japan and Chile. The distributor still continues to perform well. Some of the major problems markets are the ones I did allude to earlier. Thanks. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan Stanley (sic) [Securities] (42:10). Your line is now open. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Two quick questions here. The first is, and I apologize if you gave this in the numbers. Did you talk about the underlying growth of the acquired Coke brands in terms of how you think they're doing? And will the bottlers view them as reinvigorated as you take over responsibility for or ownership for them? And then secondly, I had a question on the gross margin. Given the regional mix with weaker U.S. and stronger international, the gross margin was still up a lot. Any thoughts in terms of what's driving the gross margin expansion? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Gross margin generally has probably been affected a little bit by the Concentrate division, which is the strategic brands which have higher gross margins. And we've just been able to achieve some lower costs, which we indicated, in our brands even though there is a balance between international and domestic. But what had happened is I think our international margins have also improved on this quarter versus previous quarters. So while they are perhaps a little bit lower than our domestic margins, the improvement in those margins have had an effect and have helped push up our overall margins. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And what we said earlier on the call, John, was that there were higher gross margins because in the Finished Products segment, which is largely a function of product sales mix and lower cost of certain raw materials. So we did refer to that earlier on in the call. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: So could you repeat your first question, John? Hello? John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you hear me? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, no. Can you repeat your first question? John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. So the first question was about the Coke energy brands that you acquired and what the underlying trends were for those businesses in July and whether the bottlers feel more reinvigorated given the fact that you are going to be probably providing a greater level of focus on those brands. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: I just want to remind everyone that the Concentrate business was only in for two weeks in the quarter. We closed the transaction on the 12th, which is a Friday. From the 15th to the end of the month, the Concentrate sales were incorporated in the financial results for this quarter. So turning to July, I don't have those numbers for July. I think we had them earlier for the Concentrate division. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: I think the sales for the Concentrate division or the brands have been a little choppy but it's been very early. We only got the brands recently. We then didn't have access to a lot of the underlying marketing information about the brands until we closed. We're still getting information and trying to understand the brands. We have marketing guys working with us. Some of the people we took on from Coke but some of our own guys are having to travel to different markets to try and understand the brands. And we're still trying to put together our strategy on these brands. Obviously, we've talked with the Coke guys and we've reassured them that we're going to obviously focus on these brands and give these brands attention. And at the moment, I think they're doing fine, but I can't give you an indication of direction because it really just is too premature. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I'm just looking at the numbers we have. We don't have them with us as to what happened in July with the Concentrate business last year. We know obviously what it was this year but we don't have it here. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: I think we're just going to have to just spend some time before we start giving more direction. I mean, they are continuing to upgrade pretty decently in most markets. There are a couple of individual markets where the bottlers were sort of not happy and we've seen them want to discontinue some of the brands in some small markets and small brands. Like I mentioned earlier that they decided to discontinue Gladiator in Mexico and then Samurai was discontinued in the Philippines, which was a low-priced brand there. But by and large, the markets are fine. And the most important markets are actually the U.S. with NOS. And we feel the brand is good. It has slowed a little bit. We think there may have been a little bit of a pulling back on some of the marketing spend behind the brand. But we believe in the brand and the bottlers in the U.S. also believe in the brand and I think we can obviously make that brand grow. So we are positive about the NOS brand going forward. And we think that there is a role for Full Throttle in the portfolio as well. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: NOS has increased actually in the 12 weeks that we mentioned earlier as well in all outlets combined by 14.9%. So sales of Full Throttle were down 0.2% and the overall market was up by 10.3%. So NOS grew in excess of the market. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. So that continues to perform and we're excited about that \u2013 the NOS brand. And there are a number of the brands that we really see as very good opportunities around the world in the portfolio. Thank you very much. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy drink line together with the newly acquired strategic brands. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect.",

As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company closed on June 12, 2015. We are continuing to implement our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. Our transition in Germany in July was successfully implemented and we are starting to see an improvement in the quality of our distribution with and execution by that bottler. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group that will be applied across 28 countries serviced by them for Coca-Cola. Monster is currently being distributed through the Hellenic Group in approximately 14 countries. We are currently in the process of signing agreements and planning for the transitions and or launches of Monster in the remaining 14 countries within the Hellenic Group's distribution network. Of particular note are our plans to transition our brand from our existing distributors in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia to Hellenic as well as to launch Monster in Russia through Hellenic before the end of this year. Another substantial opportunity for us with Hellenic is the planned launch of Monster in Nigeria in 2016. We have commenced discussions regarding the production of Monster locally with Hellenic in Nigeria, which is one of the two largest energy drink markets in Africa, the other being South Africa. Besides the agreement with Hellenic we have also reached definitive agreements with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Spain and Portugal, which are large markets for Monster. We are planning to transition monster in Spain and Portugal from our existing distributors to Coca-Cola Iberia partners early in the first quarter of 2016. We have had positive discussions with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Southern Africa and are in the process of commencing the distribution of Monster in a number of countries in Southern and Central Africa through Coca-Cola bottlers. We are planning to commence local production of Monster in South Africa in the next few months. We are also planning to launch Monster in China. We have filed applications for approval of our product and have commenced negotiations with the Coca-Cola bottlers for production and distribution of Monster in China. Although the approval process could take longer, we are still planning to launch Monster in China in the first half of 2016. We are also pleased to report that we entered into a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Beverage Company owned by Ladies and gentlemen Household & Health Care Limited in Korea to distribute Monster in South Korea and are in the process of making transitioned arrangements with them. We are continuing negotiations regarding the prospective transitioning of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South and Central America as well as in Australia. While we have made good progress, many legal and financial issues still need to be resolved. We are hopeful that we will be able to make further progress over the next few months. We are also engage in ongoing negotiations to transition monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of smaller countries worldwide. We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola energy brands, which we acquired and refer to as our strategic brands, as a Concentrate business similar to the manner in which the Coca-Cola company operated such business prior to the closing of the transaction. Under the Concentrate model, concentrate and our beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients in containers to produce the finished product. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our own Monster energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Such arrangements will form part of our Finished Products segment. As previously indicated our reportable segments will reflect our view of the business going forward. In this quarter we reported on three operating and reportable segments : one, Finished Products, the principle product of which include the company's Monster energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment; two, Concentrate, the principle of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola; three, Other, the principle products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions including those which previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peach tea brand. Sales in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements as well as the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network given the anticipated implementation of the transitions in their territories. Additionally our bottle in Great Britain experienced production issues causing production to be suspended for a number of weeks towards the end of the quarter and most of October resulting in loss sales to us both for the quarter and in October. Although substantial progress was made during the third quarter, results were still affected by out of stock retail, although at a lower level than in the previous quarter. Gross sales for the 2015 third quarter were $862.4 million compared to gross sales of $738.1 million in the comparable third quarter of 2014, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales in the 2015 third quarter were $756.6 million as compared to $636 million in the same period last year, an increase of 19%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $34.1 million on gross sales and approximately $28.6 million on net sales. Gross and net sales were impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the quarter due to a price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain of our Monster 16 ounce energy drinks. We estimate that approximately $12 million of gross sales and $11 million of net sales in the quarter were attributable to such advance purchases. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 61.5% as compared to 53.8% for the comparable 2014 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment as well as the sale of the non-energy brands, the price increase referred to earlier, lower cost of certain raw materials and changes in product sales mix. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.5% for the 2015 third quarter compared to 4.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% compared to 10.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Advertising costs, sponsorships and endorsements as well as commissions and royalties were all higher in the third quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 third quarter were 8.8% as compared to 9.2% for that corresponding quarter last year. Parallel expenses were up $7 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with the Coca-Cola transaction. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $207.8 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $173.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 20%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $170.6 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $136.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 25.2%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $34.1 million and our net sales of approximately $28.6 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transfer to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen Reports for the 13 weeks through October 24, 2015 for all outlets combined, that'd be convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased by 10.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 6.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 11.2%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 28.5%. Sales of 5-hour increased 2.8% and sales of AMP decreased 3.9%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 4.3% over the same period last year while NOS is up 3.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 11.2%. Rockstar was up 32.1%. 5-Hour was up 3.5% and AMP was down 6.6%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars decreased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 34.9%. NOS' share decreased by 0.2 of a point to 3.9%. Full Throttle's share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.8 points to 34.8%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar's share was up 1.5 points at 8.2%, which is similar to the market share Rockstar had two years ago. 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.2% and AMP's share decreased 0.3 points to 2%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 5.9% higher than in the same period last year while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.6% higher. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 19, 2015 the energy drink category increased 8%. Monster sales were up 32% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 5.7 points to 30.4% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 2.5 points to 39.1%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share decreased 0.4 points to 16%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico the energy drink category grew 31% in the month of August 2015. Monster sales increased 24%. Our market share decreased 1.8 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired brands, increased 8% although Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 5.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 17.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 5.1 points to 26.9% while Boost's market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 13.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ended September, 2015 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12% in Great Britain, from 16.6% to 19.4% in France and from 8.9% to 12% in Germany. In the same period Monster's value share grew from 8% to 9% in Sweden, from 7.9% to 8.7% in Belgium and from 5.6% to 6.1% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended in the August, 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 17.6% to 15.7% in South Africa, although in local currency sales were higher. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending September, 2015 in Spain decreased from 22.75 to 22.1% and in Italy decreased from 12.6% to 10.3%. These latter three markets all have independent distributors. According to IRI Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks to the end of September, 2015 from 28.2% to 29.4%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and the IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September, 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 18.3% as compared to 11.8% last year and in Brazil Monster's market share for the month of September declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE for the month of September, 2015 the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 30% to 39.2%. The launch on Monster Energy Ultra in Japan has been positive and sales continued to be solid. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into Finished Products, Concentrate and Other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment, formerly the DSD segment but excluding Peach tea increased 15.5% to $686.7 million and operating income for the Finished Products segment increased 25.3% to $289.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $23.1 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $2.5 million of distributor termination costs. Net sales for the new Concentrate segment were $69.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and operating income for the Concentrate segment was $45.3 million. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $5.5 million of foreign currency movements. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $41.6 million of net sales in the third quarter of 2014. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa net sales in the third quarter in local currencies increased 45.4% and 19.9% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 38% in the same period last year to 51.5% during the quarter. While Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, throughout the third quarter growth in Spain and Italy in particular were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty following the Coca-Cola transaction. We believe that this situation will be reversed once Monster is transitioned in these countries to the Coca-Cola bottlers. Overall EMEA is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. EMEA traded profitability during the third quarter. We are continuing with the launch of Mega Monster in 553 ML cans in limited additional markets in Europe. Response from consumers has been positive and we believe sales from Mega Monster are largely incremental to sales of our original Monster 500 ML size products. In particular in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. It is noteworthy that in many of our international markets where our distribution partners anticipate the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels as compared to the same level last year were markedly lower than the sales levels in those markets which are being managed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. In Asia Pacific net sales in the third quarter increased 64% in local currencies and 42.6% in dollars over the comparable quarter last year. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean in the third quarter increased 65.8% in local currencies and 45.7% in dollars over the comparable period in 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions in Brazil along with the uncertainty for the distributor there associated with the Coca-Cola transaction. In Japan net sales increased by 11% in dollars and 34.1% in local currency during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico net sales increased by 48.8% in dollars and 72.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the region in the third quarter of 2015. India continues to be impacted by regulatory issues and we continued to incur losses in the first quarter. We are addressing these issues and hope to achieve a resolution in the near future. We continue to be actively involved in discussion with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating a large number of local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers but in the U.S. and internationally which we believe will yield cost reductions. As previously reported, we have reformulated and repositioned our Muscle Monster line. In September a new Juice Monster drink named Pipeline Punch was launched exclusively with 7-Eleven. During the 2015 third quarter the company purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of the common stock and every purchase price of $134.43 per share. Purchases were made under a prior repurchase program authorized by the Board which has been exhausted as well as under the new 500 million share repurchase program announced in September 2015. Subsequent to the close of the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.6 million shares. Hilton Schlosberg : 0.06. Rodney Sacks : 0.06 million shares at an average purchase price of $134.12 per share. The company has approximately $250 million available under its current board authorize repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.5 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $34.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Including short and long-term investments our auction rate security is $1.5 million, which are now being redeemed in full. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43 days at September 30, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 38.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventory decreased to $159.7 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 49.4 days at September 30, 2015 which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. In November we will be launching Pipeline Punch as well as Ultra Black nationally. Our reposition of Monster Energy Rehab, Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines all continue to make good progress. We are planning to launch additional new products early in 2016. Gross sales in October 2015 in dollars adjusted for the advance purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 6.8% higher than October 2014. In local currencies gross sales in October adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 10.6% higher than in October 2014. October 2014 included the old warehouse division and Peach Tea. October 2014 comes to a high. October also had one less selling days in October 2014 and was also negatively impacted by the production issues experienced in Great Britain. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we continue to be pleased with the Coca-Cola transaction and the opportunity that this presents to the company. Two, North American and international gross margins are healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category is continuing to grow. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. Ultra continues to perform well, we believe that the changes made to and the repositioning of our Rehab, Juice and Punch Monsters lines have been positive. With regard to international markets, we are particularly pleased with the performance of a number of our international markets, particularly Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Chile, Ireland and Greece. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys. Rodney Sacks : Good evening. Kevin Grundy : So first a broader question and then just a couple brief modeling questions. First, can you talk about the investment that you think is going to be necessary specifically in Russia and China with your big opportunities, but relatively going to be new markets for you? Talk about what sort of lift you're expecting there, how you're defining success and then if you could touch on the investment piece? And then a modeling question for you, Hilton. Just margins were particularly strong in the quarter. What we should expect there for the balance of the year going forward? And then some guidance on the long-term tax rate. Thank you very much. Rodney Sacks : I think that much of what you're asking is really forward-looking, which we have historically not given and we're not going to give. So the large part of your question will remain unanswered. We don't believe there is - at this point, our intention in launching in Russia is not going to be different to the way we have historically launched. And there may be some changes in China but it's too premature for us to even make that decision. We've not made it. We are at the moment evaluating the market and how we're going to go to market in Russia. Again, we do not believe that those would be extraordinarily high or different in any way to how we've gone in the past but it really is premature for us to give you any real indication on that. With regards to the tax rate, Hilton will give you some response on that going forward and I'll hand over to him. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Kevin, there were two questions you asked. One was about margins and, as you know, we do not give guidance. However, what I can tell you is that we took a price increase on certain of our Monster 16-ounce line effective August 31. So we had one month of sales with increased prices and there were buy-ins in that period as well, which we referred to, and there were some buy-ins in September. So you can factor that into your analysis. The second thing is we have looked at the tax rate and we believe here and obviously we stand corrected but we think our tax rate should be more normalized at about 37.5%. Kevin Grundy : Very good. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yeah, hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Sacks : Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan : Just a couple of logistics modeling type questions. Could you give the split of your legacy business sales in the U.S. and international so we can get a sense of the comparisons there? And then separately, just curious how you think the price increase has impacted your market share and volumes just broadly? And then sort of market dynamics, I know there's been a lot made of a strange weeks' worth of data in the scanner services. So curious if you could comment on that. And obviously in the context of the weaker results in October, sort of hearing what you're saying, how much of that is the pieces that you were talking about, the moving parts versus underlying weakening and in demand for you or just the category broadly? Rodney Sacks : Yeah, just to start with the Nielsen in October, the months particularly of October was sort of a choppy month. And we just think that it's the timing of promotions, the timing of launches. Things are sort of - with all these other factors, we think they did have some influence over it. We don't believe that it will be ongoing but we believe that the rest of the quarter will improve. But we still see strength in the category. We have a number of new products launches planned for the beginning, early next year and running through a number of quarters next year. So we believe that you just should not have that high regard or influence on the single month's numbers. With regard to the split between the legacy, we've given you that split throughout the company. We haven't divided it into the U.S. versus the rest of the world. And I don't have that debt number about what we've done it. We look at it in country by country and regions. So I don't have that really but I'm not sure that we should be providing that information at this point we know because then that starts creating other issues and segments. And so at this point we'd like to just leave it at the Finished Products and Concentrates segments as a group going forward. Mark Astrachan : Okay. Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is now open. Caroline Levy : Could you just clarify, when you said October's up 7%, was that including international? That was a worldwide number? Rodney Sacks : Yes. Caroline Levy : Okay. And 10 if you exclude the advanced purchases? Rodney Sacks : Forex. Caroline Levy : Oh, that was forex? Rodney Sacks : Yeah. Caroline Levy : Okay. Sorry, sorry. Would you be able to give us the breakup - I mean your case sales seem to include Concentrate, which then distorts what your Finished Product, we can't get at what Finished Product grew or what net revenue per Finished Product case looks like. Would you be willing to share that? Rodney Sacks : So you're looking for a break out again of the Finished Product cases and we, again, this is... Hilton Schlosberg : We haven't - you'll see the statement information. You'll see Finished Goods and you'll see Concentrates in the Q, which we're hoping to release tomorrow or Monday. So you'll have that then. And we're looking forward as whether it will make sense to give case numbers. Caroline Levy : Because I think it's very hard to model something if we don't have an idea of what volume pricing - and you give us contact I think by division, but we need that volume in pricing by division, if at all possible. So anyway just lastly, could you talk - getting back to share loss, which is what we're seeing in the measured data and we actually haven't seen that for several years. And then a few months ago Red Bull started growing significantly faster than you guys. And I thought maybe with the price increase you would catch up but it doesn't appear to be happening. So are there any other dynamics over the past couple of months that would have affected that other than launch timing? Rodney Sacks : Well, again it depends on how you, you've got to look at the two-year step numbers and where we were. So those have quite a big impact on share, or if you take share loss. Red Bull's numbers are basically been a percent or two above ours generally. And but again, they had - they took a price increase in January at a slightly higher level which seems to have stuck. We are really just starting to try and get the - our price level solidified. But if you look at cases and units, then our market share in fact increased and ahead of Red Bull's. Operator : Thank you. And our next question... Hilton Schlosberg : So and that's what I'm a little confused about, Caroline, because we mentioned on the call today that in convenience, which is a major sector, our share's actually higher than Red Bull's. So what you're looking at is year-on-year historical 2014 versus 2015. But if you look at the actual share, our share in convenience according to Nielsen is bigger than that of Red Bull. Rodney Sacks : And it's been trending that way for the last three months. We've been increasing share. So these figures are sometimes - you've got to read, depends how you read them. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is - good afternoon. This is actually Atisha on behalf of Pablo. I have more of a strategic level question. For the markets where you're planning to keep your distributors, what kind of emphasis will be played on the energy drink brands acquired? And can we expect any kind of attrition cannibalization of those brands? And on the flip side, where you will be moving to the new Coke system in the countries, should we expect some attrition for those brands? And if not, how will those brands be segmented in those countries. Rodney Sacks : I think that we don't believe there will be any attrition in our business. The whole strategy is that in those countries that we stay with our existing distributors like Japan, then they will stay with whatever portfolio they have and if we have portfolio that we've acquired, in Japan there just isn't one but in other countries where there is one then that will be managed through the Coke bottler. We've taken assignment of the Coke distribution arrangement or contract and that will simply be managed. In the cases where we are going to transition Monster, we are going to transition them and the outputs are managed separately. You've got Monster going into that bottler and we obviously have bought and paid for the strategic brand and we are going to manage those brands. It is our job basically to try which is different to how Coke obviously looks at their competitors, but now that we have both brands in our country, we're going to look to try and segment them and position them differently. But they both are important brands they both are, in each country good contributors to our bottom line and to our growth as a company and to giving us a stronger position, overall in the energy category in that country if you aggregate the two brands, in many countries it gives us a very strong and leading position, which I think also helps us. And obviously from a management point of view, where we can use the same stop we will try to rationalize it. But in some cases we feel you do need additional stops to take in focus on their own brand in a country. So I don't' think there will be attrition. The attrition will come from if the brand is not strong enough in a particular country to sustain its distribution or shelf space then there will be attrition but obviously we're going to try and put focus on this and try to avoid that. So at the moment, obviously we are going through a learning curve with some of then we brands. We are repositioning the new brands, we are looking to redesign them and reevaluate their size, containers, and whether we need a different size or a single size. Some of them there are too many size containers and different flavors in different countries for the same brand. We are trying to rationalize some of these and improve some of the flavors. We have plans to introduce some innovation and some new flavors for these brands, these strategic brands in 2016. So we are positive about them and that they will be managed differently and they will be managed separately, but we obviously are looking to put support behind and to do our best with all of the brands that we have in our portfolio with the energy focus. That remains our focus in that category. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi, everyone. Rodney Sacks : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : I have two questions. One is, Rodney, just a little bit more color on China as you think about 2016. One, just in terms of the clarification on where you are on the approval process. I think you said you're still expecting to launch in the first half. Any risk that it gets delayed into the back half? And then just in terms of distribution opportunity, just given the strengths of the Coca-Cola system in that country, do you expect to see distribution ramp up pretty quickly in China versus some of the other countries that you've entered? And then the second question is really on return of capital that you, in prior calls, you have commented on the Board actively looking at ways to return more cash to shareholders. Obviously, you still have a pretty sizeable cash balance on your balance sheet. But any sort of update in terms of the Board's willingness to actually take on some leverage and return even more cash to shareholders? Rodney Sacks : I'll let Hilton answer the second one. I'll address the first one, which divides the questions up. On distribution in China, we are looking at going into China not very differently to how we've addressed most of the markets where we believe we have the best prospect of success. And again, without having taken a final decision, it is unlikely that we're going to have some sort of massive national launch with big TV campaigns behind it. We like to go into a country, we'll take a number of areas or types of chains or class of business and focus on that and roll it out. And it may mean that it takes some time. It doesn't - it may not go through all of the provinces. China is very, very big. It's like saying in America, how would we launch? Well we launched in America in one county, in San Diego. And we launched in one county in Northern California. And then you sit down and grow from there and develop it. We think that that type of launch, and not necessarily one county, I mean one city, but that type of launch is far better. If it's a smaller country, it's a lot easier to get your distribution up. But China is a massive country, it's like a continent. And we're still working through the strategy as to how do we launch, where do we launch, what cities do we launch in, do we launch a little slower in two different or three different types of cities, more modern or a little more traditional, get the responses and see how we position the brand. We're going into a new market with new culture and new consumers. And it is very, very, we believe, a great opportunity for the company and enormous growth. But we need to do it correctly and we need to do it right. And we're right in the middle of this process, so it's premature for us to give you any further direction. As to the process, there are a number of alternative categories in which we believe our drinks can conform. We've made applications in two places for our products in two or three different categories. Those are currently being processed. I don't know how long it'll take. We don't think that they will take that long. We think - we are hoping in the next few months to start getting some positive response and maybe get some approvals but we really don't know how long it is. We've not done it before so we don't know. And we do have different ingredients and therefore a different time line. We can't just simply look back and compare a soda and say, how long does it take for a soda to get approved? It's a different product with different ingredients. But we still believe that we have a good prospect of launching the first half, perhaps a little later than we thought maybe a few months ago but we still think that we have a good shot of going in the first half of launching in China. And perhaps, Hilton will then take your other question. Hilton Schlosberg : Judy, the Board is still reviewing options with regard to return of capital to shareholders and we will update shareholders once this decision has been finalized. At this time, no final decision has been taken how best to accommodate a buyback. You also asked a question about leverage and I think my answer is the same answer I've given in the past. Some of us may have a - personally have an aversion to that but it's a Board decision and the Board will determine what's in the best interests of shareholders and the company. So just watch this space. That's all I can say. Judy Hong : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our newly-acquired strategic brands. We believe that our agreements with the Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. We are continuing to make good progress with the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries, and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. We have substantially completed the transition of Monster in most of the 28 countries serviced by the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group, and are currently in the process of transitioning the remaining countries. We have successfully launched Monster in Russia, and are moving forward with plans to commence production and distribution of Monster in Nigeria, through Coca-Cola Hellenic. We've also recently successfully transitioned our Monster brand in both Spain and Portugal to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners. We are continuing to transition a number of countries in Africa to Coca-Cola bottlers. This process will continue through the remainder of 2016. We've also reached agreement with Coca-Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek for distribution of Monster within the countries which fall within their Coca-Cola territory, which includes Turkey and 10 other countries. We've reached agreement with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes the Coca-Cola product in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Fiji. Finally, we having reached agreement with Big (3:42), the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in the majority of their markets. We've also made good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, Arca, and other bottlers operating in South America. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola bottlers there. We received preliminary approval from the Chinese authorities for our Monster Energy formula, and are currently awaiting formal approval. We had a successful trial run in China, and are currently engaged in additional trial runs. We are still planning to launch Monster in China late in the second quarter of 2016, but the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals. We've also made good progress in the repositioning, repackaging, and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As announced earlier in the week, we are pleased with our pending acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors, in California for $690 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The acquisition agreement was entered into on February 22, 2016 and we expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016. AFF is our principal supplier of concentrated flavors for our Monster Energy drink line. Our purchases from AFF represent approximately 87% of their sales. In 2015, AFF's total net revenues were approximately $168 million, and its adjusted operating income was approximately \u2013 sorry AFF \u2013 was approximately $87 million. It is our intention that AFF will continue to operate from its existing premises in Southern California, and will continue to carry on its business of supplying concentrates and flavors to third-party customers as it has in the past. Following the transaction, we will own the vast majority of the proprietary flavors that we use in our Monster Energy drinks including, in particular, the flavors used for our original green Monster Energy drink, Lo-Carb Monster Energy, and Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, the majority of the flavors that are used in our Java Monster and Ultra lines, as well as flavors used in many other Monster Energy drinks. We intend to continue to purchase concentrates and flavors from other flavor suppliers for both our existing products and new products we develop. Put simply, we intend to operate in the same way as we have in the past to ensure that we are able to develop and secure the best flavors in the future and to continue to excel at innovation. The acquisition of AFF will be immediately accretive to the company from the transaction's closing. The location of AFF's facilities in Southern California will facilitate our management of the business and the integration of AFF's business into the Monster organization. We are extremely excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. Our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.75 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which combined with the current outstanding authorization of $250 million remaining from the September 2015 repurchase program, totals $2 billion. We are planning to move forward with the return of capital in 2016 to our shareholders, pursuant to repurchases which could be effective pursuant to open market transactions, a modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations, and approvals. The timing of share repurchases, or a modified Dutch auction tender offer, will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Obviously, the company is expected to continue to generate cash from operations. In the fourth quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, the sales of Monster Energy products accelerated in January. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $743.2 million, up 6.7% from $696.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were $645.4 million, up 6.6% from $605.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $19.7 million. Net sales were also adversely affected by the buy-in before the price increase effective August 31, 2015, which had an estimated impact of approximately $11 million by destocking in Spain and South Africa, by existing international distributors in anticipation of our transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in these countries and also, by reduction in inventory in Germany during the fourth quarter, all of which had an estimated impact of $11.8 million. In total, such amounts had a negative impact on net sales of approximately $42.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales after adjusting for these items would have been approximately 13.6% as compared to the reported increase of 6.6%. Our original green Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter, as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as percentage of net sales was 62.5%, as compared to 54.8% for the comparable 2014 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands, and the price increase on our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2%, as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as percentage of net sales were 12.9% compared to 9.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising expenses, principally for strategic brands, merchandise display costs, social media expenses, and commissions were all higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrative costs including distributor terminations as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were 11% as compared to 9.5% for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Payroll expenses were up $6.1 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $3 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. Distributor termination costs were $3.3 million higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing and promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $3.1 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to 2014 fourth quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $1.8 million higher for the 2015 fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, giving effect to the items above, operating income for the quarter would have been approximately 31% higher than the reported operating income for the same quarter in 2014. Our effective tax rate increased from 34.7% to 39.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the reduction in the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36.5%. Net income was $138.7 million, compared to net income of $125.3 million during the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 10.7%. However, due to the substantial increase in share capital, diluted shares increased from 174.9 million to 205.8 million following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.67 for the fourth quarter from $0.72 in the 2014 comparable quarter. Turning to the full year results, the company achieved record gross sales of $3.1 billion for the full year, up 9.9% from $2.8 billion in 2014. Net sales were up 10.5% from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, totaling $84.3 million for the year. The acceleration of deferred revenue added $39.8 million to net sales in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was up 19.6% to $893.7 million from $747.5 million in 2014. Pro forma operating income is adjusted for acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million. Distributor termination costs of $224 million, the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $15.5 million as well as $161.5 million from the gain on the sale of the non-energy business was $931.9 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million over 2014. Operations from outside of North America delivered operating income of $51.5 million for the 2015 full year as compared to operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.7% in 2015 from 35.2% in 2014. Net income was $546.7 million, up 13.2% over net income of $483.2 million in 2014. And diluted earnings per share increased 2.4% to $2.84 from $2.77 in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $177.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $160 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 10.6%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $145.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $133.8 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $23.1 million, and our net sales were approximately $19.7 million. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $713.2 million in 2015, compared to $657.9 million in 2014, an increase of 8.4%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $580.3 million in 2015 compared to $534.2 million in 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $102.4 million and on net sales of approximately $84.3 million. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.7% in the 13 week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 10.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 21.7%, sales of 5-hour increased 1.6%, and sales of AMP decreased 7.4%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended January 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 7.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 9.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 7.4%, Rockstar was up 19%, 5-hour was up 2.7%, and AMP was down 10.3%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended January 23, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 0.3 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share decreased 0.2 of a point to 4.1%, and Full Throttle share decreased 0.2 points to 1.1%. Red Bull share decreased 0.2 points to 34.6%, slightly below Monster share. Rockstar share was up 0.8 points at 8.4%. 5-hour share was lower by 0.4 points at 8.4%. And AMP share decreased 0.4 points to 1.8%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended January 16, 2016, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 16.4% higher than the same period last year while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 39.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 9, 2016, the energy drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 5% versus a year ago, in line with the category. Our markets share decreased 0.2 share points to 28.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8%, and its market share increased 1.6 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales increased 10%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 18.7%. According for Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 40.7% during the month of December 2015. Monster sales increased 16.4%. Our market share decreased 5.5 points to 26.4%against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 19.5%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 6%. Red Bull sales increased 13.6%, and its market share decreased by 4 points to 16.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 11 points to 31.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 13.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ended December 2015, the OXXO 13 week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.7% to 13.5% in Great Britain, from 17.8% to 20.3% in France, from 10.6% to 13.6% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 8.6% to 10.7% in Sweden, from 8.1% to 8.6% in Belgium, and from 5.9% to 6.7% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending December 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.1% to 15.7% in South Africa, although value sales were higher according to Nielsen. Monster's retail market in value for the 13 weeks ending September 2015 in Spain increased from 21.7% to 23.7%, and in Italy decreased from 11.8% to 11%. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 from 29.7% to 30.5%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers and the IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.3% as compared to 14.2% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of November declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 15.8% in Spain, 11.4% in South Africa, and 41.8% in Germany. For the top 20 EMEA markets which account for approximately 92% of EMEA Monster volume, Nielsen reports that in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 Monster's retail value sales grew 19.3%. According to INTAGE for the month of December 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 32.6% to 38.6%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan continues to be a positive driver for the brand. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter, formerly the DSD segment, but excluding Peace Tea, were negatively impacted by approximately $16 million of foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter, and by approximately $74.1 million for the year. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter were also adversely affected by the buy-in of approximately $11 million before the price increase on August 31, 2015, and by destocking in the amount of approximately $11.8 million in Spain and South Africa, and a reduction in inventory in Germany as described above. On a pro forma basis, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the fourth quarter, after adjustments for these items, would have increased 8.5% from $574.8 million to $623.9 million in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting for foreign currency movements of $74.1 million and $39.8 million of acceleration of deferred revenues, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the year would have increased 10.3% from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $3.7 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter, and by approximately $10.2 million for the year. On a pro forma basis, after adjustment for foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $64.1 million for the quarter, ended December 31, 2015, and $153.5 million for the year. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $30.8 million of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. And for the full year 2015, net sales for the Other segment were $60.8 million as compared to $150.4 million in 2014. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in euros increased 26.3%, and in dollars increased 10.2% over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 44.2% in the same period last year to 53.4% during the quarter. For 2015, net sales in euros increased 30.5%, and in dollars increased 8.8% over 2014. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.2% in 2014 to 48.4% during 2015. Despite the destocking issues described earlier, EMEA overall is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased sales distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. The launch of MEGA Monster in 553 ML cans with the resealable lid in limited additional markets in Europe has been successful and is largely incremental to our original Monster 500 ML size products. Additionally, we have continued the launch of a limited number of SKUs in the Ultra line, in a number of countries in Europe with positive initial response. Ultra will be launched in a further 15 markets in Europe in the first half of 2016. Monster sales depletions from our distribution partners to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 18.9% in EMEA. And in particular, sale depletions experienced double-digit growth in Spain, Germany, and South Africa. In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains at retail as well as increased market share. In many international markets, where our independent distribution partners anticipated the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels were markedly lower compared to last year than sales levels in markets which were already being distributed \u2013 we were already being distributed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. We are pleased with the initial sales and distribution gains following the December launch of Monster in Russia. The rollout of Monster in Russia is currently taking place. In Asia-Pacific, net sales for the quarter increased 52.6% in local currencies, and 37.2% in dollars. For the year, net sales increased 45.1% in local currencies and 27% in dollars. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean for the quarter increased 28.8% in local currencies, and 10.7% in dollars. And for the year, increased 29.8% in local currencies and 15.7% in dollars compared to 2014. Monster's sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions there, together with the uncertainties for distributors relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Chile, sales of Monster continue to show good growth. Net sales in the quarter increased 114% over the fourth quarter of last year, and for 2015 increased 29.1% over 2014. In Mexico, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.4% in local currency and 5.4% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Mexico increased 14.2% in local currency and 10.2% in dollars as compared to 2014. In Japan, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 15.3% in local currency and 4.1% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Japan increased 32.4% in local currency and 13.4% in dollars as compared to 2014. We are moving ahead with production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We're also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $744.6 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased $15.3 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. All auction rate securities have now been redeemed in full and are no longer included in either short- or long-term investments. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014. Inventories decreased to $156.1 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 58 days at December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014. During the 2015 fourth quarter, we launched Ultra Black, which was previously sold last year on a limited time basis to a single convenience and gas chain, but it's now being made available to the general public. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Pipeline Punch nationally. In the first quarter of 2016, we launched Salted Caramel Java Monster, and are in the process of launching our new Gronk energy drink. We are planning to launch additional new products in 2016. Gross sales in January 2016 in dollars were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2015. In local currencies, gross sales in January 2016 were approximately 12.2% higher than in January 2015. January 2015 gross sales included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. This transaction will immediately be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, the board has authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion of its equity securities, in addition to the $250 million available under the previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. Once implemented, the effect of this repurchase program will be to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding, and thereby enhance earnings on a per-share basis. Three, North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continued to improve. Four, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is invariably growing ahead of the category. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We believe that the repositioning of our Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to be positive. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. Seven, we have successfully transitioned a number of countries to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : And our first question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is now open. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. I have just one point of clarification. Hi. The $42.5 million impact, was that the global number or was that just international? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : $42.5 million I believe is (34:00) it relates to international. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Yes, it does. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Relates to international. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's just international. Perfect. Thank you for that. And so my bigger picture question, clearly, the underlying health of the business is just fine, and there's a lot of moving pieces in terms of this transition, but can you help give us a sense of the timeline of when we might expect some of this destocking and distributor transition disruption to abate, please? Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I just want to clarify, that $42.5 million does include the impact of destocking. Yeah, which is then global. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Not the destocking, the buy-in. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The buy-in. Sorry. It does include the buy-in. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: It does include the $11 million from that buy-in. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yep, so I want to just clarify that. Sorry, could you repeat your follow on question? Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Certainly. So lots of moving pieces, underlying business remains healthy, but the disruption is clearly a little bit painful, so can you give us a sense for how you see that progressing, and then we might be through that? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. We are clearly having a choppy time just getting everything implemented and in line. There are a lot of moving pieces all over the world. And we believe that pretty much we should be done with a lot of the transitions by \u2013 we hope, by the end of the second quarter or at a position where we've at least negotiated the transitions, and are starting to implement them. That's been part of the uncertainty. Now that uncertainty will start being removed. We believe that the actual results will start flowing through once we've transitioned markets, and that does take some time. But we think that will be \u2013 we'll start seeing the impact of that through the second half of the year. But \u2013 so we really just believe it's been pretty much a year of transition for us from when we originally closed the transaction, and we are, as we've indicated throughout the call, at an advanced stage of our discussions with really the principal Coca-Cola bottlers around the world. So we do anticipate we will start seeing some really rapid advances in that regard. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Quickly, two things. One, can you give us a little more behind the thought process on the size of the share repurchase? Why not more? Why this? And then, also on the AFF acquisition yesterday, can you give us a little idea, I'm just trying to understand, should we just bake in that whole $90 million of operating income that you'll receive or is there some since they were a supplier, do you not get all of that? I mean, how do we model that going forward? Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Bill, maybe I can answer that. Hi. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: On your first question, I think you know that we are conservative folk when it comes to borrowing, and we took a decision, and the board took a decision that we would rather maintain a cash-positive situation, hence the amount of the buyback. So the results of the buyback will mean that we will not have to go into borrowings. So that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is the $87 million operating income that we discussed is the operating income in 2015. Some of the customers may, in fact, choose not to continue with the company. But we account for 87% of the company's business. And the business that we place with AFF is indeed profitable to them. So as you model, I think a good chunk of that $87 million could be taken into enhancing operating income for the consolidated organization. But as results of the other 13%, it's really too premature to say. But the number will be determined in due course. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So the 9.5% gross sales in January, just want to clarify. So that includes the new Coke Concentrate acquired business, but also laps the old business, which includes the Warehouse business. Is that correct? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is correct. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then secondly, just trying to understand again the supply-demand reported versus, and demand metrics here, I don't get it. I mean, I understand there's moving parts here, but last quarter you killed numbers versus expectations. The June quarter was almost flat. This quarter, again, a miss relative to people's expectations. I get you don't give guidance. But, I guess, is there anything that you can help us sort of understand that makes us believe that the end demand per what we see in the scanner data in the U.S., what we hear from distributors outside of the U.S., is still consistent with how you believe your end demand is actually looking? And, obviously, then reconcile that with what you reported from a top line standpoint in the quarter. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that you've got to look at the \u2013 and that's a very good indicator, that's why we spent time on the call dealing with the Nielsen numbers, and we've actually also referred to some of the sales-out numbers from our distributors because that is more indicative of your ongoing and sort of more stable demand for our product. So Nielsen are just \u2013 as you know is pure scanned data, and therefore, that's the demand that's happening. And then your demand from retailers, unless there is a big promotion, that is also less choppy than our demand. Our demands are really \u2013 clearly, our demand for our products from our customers is choppy and that choppiness has been exacerbated during the last probably 12 months or so. But because of all these announcements, because of the changes, different bottlers or distributors have different policies in holding inventory. Some bolt up extra inventory because they would just \u2013 I think anticipate it being canceled, and having their own minds, that somehow that would give them a longer period to sell, or different opportunities to sell, and then you've got to deal with that inventory situation. And there were a lot of independent \u2013 there were independent bottlers, and that's part of the issues, and there was no consistent pattern. And that really is what has happened. And so, obviously, we can only report our revenues as they are and as they come into us, and we try and match them as well. And so, we believe that the \u2013 literally if you're looking to the trends, the more important trends are not our reports over the last three quarters or four quarters, but it is the Nielsen numbers which are showing consistent numbers, and showing good growth both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's what keeps us excited and makes us comfortable that as to the direction of our brand, and our brand is continuing to grow. And so as soon as we are able to actually get through all these transitions, get rid of the uncertainties, we will see long term growth that we think a healthy growth for the brand and for the company. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I want to talk a little bit about the Concentrate revenues, and Hilton, you talked about this before that the numbers that we got in the filings were pro forma numbers, but it seems as though the Concentrate numbers continue to come in a little bit lower than \u2013 well, not a little bit this quarter, a lot lower than what I would have anticipated there. Is there \u2013 is that FX? Is that volume? Is that inventory adjustments at the bottlers as you look to transition to this new model? Is there something going on in terms of the Concentrate revenues versus the pro forma numbers that we got in the filings? Thank you. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Well, some of it was indeed forex, as we highlighted that number on the call. Some of it was that some of the international distributors \u2013 international bottlers were, in fact, overstocked as we went into the transaction really to ensure that they would not miss a beat with regard to production. So, some of it is that. Some of it is indeed the fact that some of the KO brands have been falling off in market share, and that is something that we are addressing. We spoke earlier that we're repositioning a number of their brands \u2013 or a number of our brands. We're repackaging them, and we have a number of marketing initiatives going with regard to those brands. So a lot of it is a lot of all of that. But, in essence, I think we remain satisfied with the acquisition of the strategic brands, and we remain satisfied with the profitability that those strategic brands are generating to us relative to the purchase consideration that we paid. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And we are starting to see positively \u2013 also I think there was a little bit of a drop-off in morale from the bottlers for some of those brands in some of the areas. And they hadn't seen sort of the levels of investment or a clear direction or positioning for those brands. We are taking steps to deal with that now and to address those issues. We've changed some of the marketing and the focus and the positioning of the brands and these things does take time to turn this around in different regions of the world. But we are doing that, and we've got into it now. We're introducing some new flavors. And as Hilton indicated, our packaging has changed on some of them and we're continuing to make changes. But most important, we've actually decided on some strategic positioning for the brands. And again, those are being changed. I mean in many cases, one of the higher costs we had was, for example, advertising. There was an advertising campaign that we committed in order to, in the best interest of the brands, we continue to be responsible for it. It was committed before we took over. But ultimately, we don't believe that that was really beneficial for the brand, and it's not a direction we're going on, so we've changed those directions. So these are the changes that we are making, and long-term, we believe we will stabilize and continue to grow these brands, but in slightly different ways. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: I think I also may have mentioned it, and if I didn't, I should say that some of those brands also did not benefit from the same level of marketing contribution that they had in the past. So they definitely, as we moved through the transition, there was a reduction in marketing expenditure on those brands. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, thanks. Just two questions from me. On the acquisition, does this flavor supplier, are they dealing with some of these new breakthrough products that you've been discussing, the three to four new products? Just wanted to get some clarity on that. And then the bigger picture question is when you think philosophically about how you launch into a market, should we think about it in a similar template on how you handle the U.S. in terms of kind of SKU by SKU, flavor by flavor, or do you think you'll go with a much broader SKU set as you enter some of these global markets? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Just perhaps dealing with the SKU set, there isn't a one-formula-fits-all. In some countries, we'll launch with two or three flavors, but not a massive array of 10 flavors. In other countries, we'll do one or two flavors. And then obviously try and seed up our principal Green Monster, that's the flagship, that's where all our marketing around the world goes to, and get that on the shelf. And then basically expand from there as quickly or as slowly as we need in order to make sure that we're able to get our products on the shelf and they're able to sustain a satisfactory sell rate. And so that is (47:24) and that's what we've done throughout Europe and everywhere else. We started with two flavors, I think it was Green and then Lo-Carb, and then we introduced a juice, and then we introduced another. And that is how we've continued to go. In some of the Ultra flavors in Europe, we took the decision to actually introduce two or three at the same time as a line. So again, it's flexible, and it depends on where we see the demand and where we see the ability to secure shelf space for the products. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: And then the second question \u2013 or the first question I think was is this flavor company involved in developing new flavors for us for new products? And the answer is yes. The other point I wanted to make earlier to Bill Chappell, and I'm just going to make it on the call, is that we spoke about the total net revenues of $168 million approximately from AFF. Please remember that as we go forward, a significant part of that will flow through in cost of sales and gross margin rather than in additional revenues, because on a consolidated basis, we will not reporting those sales as sales. They'll come into our financials as a reduction in cost. Operator : This concludes Q&A for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much. One of the things I would like to perhaps just stress on the call is I think there've been one or two questions that were just posed to us as to why we did the transaction now and timing and we have other things. But I just wanted to say that this was an acquisition and the strategy behind buying and getting ownership of our own flavors was something we considered very important and valuable as far back as a decade ago. And we have made approaches repeatedly, we have spent time trying to negotiate. And really it came about last year that I think the owner was approaching getting I think close to his 80th birthday, and for the first time after an approach, they decided that they were receptive, the family, to an approach. And obviously, we took the opportunity when we could. It wasn't just spur-of-the-moment. This was something we've been wanting to do for a very long time. And then, there has been some other suggestion asked whether this is \u2013 people if we could expect more acquisitions along this line. We don't think so. We're not going to say, give you an emphatic no on anything. But certainly that is not our intention to get into the flavor business or concentrate business. We're not intending to expand it. This clearly was a very strategic acquisition for a supplier of almost all of our products. And for us, we're able to lock up pretty much most of these revenues, or our revenues, as we sell. As we go forward, every additional case of Monster we sell, that will be additional margin that we will able to basically drop to our bottom line. So we see this as a very low risk and a very strategic acquisition. It's based in California, it's easy to manage. It's not a massive staff. It's not a very capital intensive business. It has a very low capital base, a very low working capital requirement. It was also strategic we felt to enable our flavor supplier to grow internationally with us. As a private company, they had faced some challenges in many countries and actually having the resources and the expertise to have their flavors get through the regulatory process in these countries and be able to import ingredients, and particularly ingredients and supply them in country. And not being an international base, but yet their flavors were obviously very, very important and key for us. So we believe that by aligning ourselves with them, we will be able to facilitate and help them through, on the regulatory side. We have quite a deep bench of staff here who understand regulatory issues and legal issues, or in the regulatory area. We also obviously, as it's important for us, as we expand into many more countries and many more distant places, we want to really have the opportunity to put our best foot forward and have these key flavors come from this supplier and not have to resort to alternative suppliers. But that being said, obviously we do also still intend to continue to work with our existing suppliers, because we want everybody to \u2013 we want to obviously ensure that we're still able to get cutting edge technology, cutting edge flavors, have everybody stay competitive whether it's on the AFF side or our independent suppliers side. And so for all those reasons we do believe this transaction to be very, very important for us going forward. Thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in the company. We continue to obviously believe in the company and our growth strategy and are committed to continuing to develop and to differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad and in particular, to expand distribution of our products, including the strategic brands, through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with our robust portfolio, together with our newly acquired strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Schlosberg - VC, President, COO, CFO and Secretary Analysts : Kevin Grundy - Jefferies Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel William B. Chappell - SunTrust John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Caroline Levy - CLSA Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2016 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. You may begin. Rodney Cyril Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this call. I\u2019m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management, with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016 including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. At the outset I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola Global System Meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries, and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally as previously reported we have concluded agreements with BTIG the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operate in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola System. In Shanghai we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are full planning to launch monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed the launch could be delayed by various factors including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year following discussions with their regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, Arca and other bottler operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler with Lindley, which is controlled by Arca for distribution of Monster in Peru and are planning to launch the Monster in Peru on June 2nd. We are also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the insuring quarters. We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were required as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. Consistent with the company\u2019s previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intend to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. In the first quarter sales in the beverage industry in general and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, sales of Monster product accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015 in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola System. With an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently the results of the comfortable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination cost of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction cost to $3.6 million. Our ensuring discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination process and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to about. In the first quarter the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 12.3 million. Our original green energy drink Monster Energy Drink continues to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2%, as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands, and the price increase on our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4%, as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs, and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. General and administrative costs excluding distributor terminations costs and Coca-Cola transaction cost as a percentage of net sales for the 2016 first quarter were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of $5 million increase in payroll due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a non-cash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. Also including general and administrative costs is amortization of trademarks a non-cash item of $1.8 million attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands.  Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company\u2019s products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $166.1 million, compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from $173.8 million to $206.9 million following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million respectively, including geographic sales reported are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through March 2016 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.8% in the 13 week period, while sales of NOS increased 2.5%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 14.2%, sales of 5-hour decreased 0.1%, and sales of AMP decreased 8.1%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-hour was up 1.9%, and AMP was down 4.5%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended March 2016, Monster\u2019s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS' share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster share. Rockstar share was up 0.5 points at 7.9%. 5-hour share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3% and AMP share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 25.2% higher. We\u2019d like to mention there have been some changes in the dollar base we use to report on this category.  According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 05, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago, our market share increased 0.3 share point to 27.8%, Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. According to Nielsen for all our outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%, our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 4.9%, although Burn\u2019s market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7 of a percent, and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100\u2019s market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost\u2019s market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.  According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ended March 2016, the actual 13 week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain, from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden, from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium, from 6.5% to 9% in Norway, from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13 week period ended February 2016, according to Nielson Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.1% to 13.6% in Germany and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa although value sales were 19.3% higher according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster\u2019s retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7% and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According IRI Monster\u2019s market share in Greece decreased in the 13 weeks at the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%.  I would like to point that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increase to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year. And in Brazil Monster\u2019s market share for the month of March 2016 declined from 4.7% to 3.1% as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea for the month of March 2016 Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience and store channel in Japan, Monster\u2019s market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from a comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company\u2019s Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements net sales for the concentrated segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015 there were sales for the other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain Monster\u2019s largest market in the EMEA during the quarter following the implementation of new software. Monster continue to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall EMEA is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional eight markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. In Asia-Pacific net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during the 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico net sales decreased impart due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. In Chile net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.  As previously mentioned we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities for Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016 prior to the close of the AAF conception compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015.  During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as the refreshment energize in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. As previously disclosed we also have additional new products plan for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual we can only provide the estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016 we estimated April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrate segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AAF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company\u2019s earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company\u2019s previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016 the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at price range to be specified.  The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand, while Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company\u2019s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. I\u2019d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, good morning, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks : Good morning. Kevin Grundy : I want to start with China given the importance of your launch in that market, can you talk a little bit about building upon the timing of that around the brand positioning, the investment that\u2019s going to be required for trial there to raise brand awareness that would be helpful. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks : To give most of the information that you are asking would be giving future estimates and indications and even more difficulty in a market that we are just going into. We are -- all I would like to say about China is that we are planning to enter China in a similar way to which we have entered other markets. We look at building distribution on a store-by-store basis, we are going into the market with one SKU which is Monster green primarily our main product. As I indicated in the call, we are still looking to finalize negotiations with our distribution partners on the distributions agreements and those negotiations have been taking -- have taken some time. We are progressing with registrations. So we are in a new country it\u2019s -- we are looking at -- obviously we don\u2019t have a lot of experience there because we\u2019ve not been there. And so to say more than that I don\u2019t know we are looking to continue later this year, but there could be some delays in getting the registrations, but we are continuing to focus on China and I just don\u2019t believe that there is more at this point that we will be able to say. Obviously, we will need to make investments in the market, which we will do as appropriate to establish the brand, but it\u2019s a slow traditional build for us going into China. Kevin Grundy : Can I ask a follow-up? Rodney Cyril Sacks : Yes. Kevin Grundy : Thank you. Just switching gears to the U.S. some of the Nielson data has slowed a bit broadly for the category and some of this may have been that we\u2019ve cycled the pricing that Red Bull has taken and you want to cycle that into the fall, but can you talk a little bit about some of the slowing that we are seeing broadly in the category in the U.S. whether that\u2019s concerning at all or whether you think it\u2019s a bit of blip and then what is our expectations broadly for the category for the balance of the year? Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks : The category, might be seeing a slowing slightly, but obviously it\u2019s still growing at a good positive rate, you have got to look at the category in the context of beverages generally, I think the point you made is one of the important points is that part of that category\u2019s growth is that we are cycling on price increases now and if you look at the growth and it\u2019s largely is influenced -- the category growth largely gets influenced by the growth that obviously Red Bull enough contribute to the category as the major participants in the country. And you have seen a slowing in the Red Bull numbers and that really has probably a large influence on that category. So we don\u2019t see much difference, we are positive about the category, but obviously we can\u2019t tell where the category will grow, what sort of innovation will come from our competitors, we have innovations as I have indicated coming. It is going to come later in the year, but we do have quite a robust innovation pipeline. Operator : And our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Judy Hong : Thank you, good morning. Rodney Cyril Sacks : Good morning, Judy. Hilton H. Schlosberg: Good morning, Judy. Judy Hong : So broadly speaking it seems like your international sales growth has accelerated in Q1 versus Q4 and I was just hoping to get a little bit more color just in terms of how much is this really lapping some of the inventory issues that you have had and are we now mostly behind some of that issues? How much are you getting growth in some of the transition market and as you look over the next six months markets like Australia where you are transitioning to Amatil and then you got Nigeria and some of the newer markets you are entering just your expectation in terms of how quickly you can see growth accelerating just broadly from an international perspective? Rodney Cyril Sacks : Again, like everything in life everybody would like things to happen instantaneously, but it takes time and as we transition we are starting to see once you have had an opportunity to settle down with the particular bottler in that market we all starting to see good progress. But again is also depends on the commitment of a bottler and each bottler has his own priorities, his own commitments and it is varied, but if you look at the trend Judy, which is clearly from what we have given the indication on each of the countries on our market share. The trend generally is continuing to be positive and we are continuing to take market share. Hilton H. Schlosberg: I would say look at the German numbers Judy that we spoke about on the call and also South Korea. Those are two markets that have been transitioned to the Coca-Cola System. Those may give some indications but the other markets that we have not seen that amount of growth and those are some of the Hellenic markets. So as Rodney said it does differ from country to country. So those are two good indications here. Rodney Cyril Sacks : So we just think generally it\u2019s positive and as we go forward obviously we do look work our way through the choppiness and the transition issues that we had in the past. Operator : Thank you. And our next question come from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open. Mark S. Astrachan: Hey, good morning, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks : Hi, Mark. Good morning. Hilton H. Schlosberg: Good morning. Mark S. Astrachan: I wanted to ask about the Concentrate business. So it still seems to be a little bit weaker I think than it was originally trending going into the deal close. I guess I\u2019m curious if you were to try to parse it out sort of differently maybe there is some questions have been asked about it in the past. How much of the under performance has been driven by some of the larger brands like Relentless in particular, but also like Burn in terms of what has happened from relaunches, repositionings, potential reductions in shelf space in favorable Monster and the like. In other words is there a way to sort of think about it split up by the bigger brands and maybe even comment on some of those smaller brands that could be getting discontinued? Hilton H. Schlosberg: I think it\u2019s a mix bag. I actually have done full analysis of these strategic brand. Like you we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brand. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brand themselves that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that of course is a foreign currency and there is another factor in that in certain countries we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually self concentrate and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from the Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sell the Concentrate. The struction is sitting up various countries to accommodate the Concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the Concentrate business. But largely there is some weakness, but you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the Concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place. Rodney Cyril Sacks : I think that one other thing we did mentioned previously that we did find that in some of the cases the investment in the strategic brands prior to and during the transition had been trimmed and cut back and that did affect sale. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result we believe of that. So what we\u2019ve had to do is not only just go in and blindly obviously reinvest in marketing, but we\u2019ve had to relook at how we repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done both in repackaging, in designs, in flavors and then obviously then recreate marketing plans to fit those the new positioning that we have looked at four of these brands particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are two of the large brands that did have some weakness. We\u2019ve also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S. although we haven\u2019t changed packaging, we all are going to modernize that packaging and that\u2019s still coming through now. So this is a long process because there were many brands in many countries and laid on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster it takes a long-term to get a lot of these reposition done. So we think that\u2019s partially the reason for it and yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated but we are -- we have been doing the repositioning, we have doing some focusing, we are starting to see some strong signs and we do believe that that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands although smaller again it\u2019s a mix big you can\u2019t put it into one category because in some cases the brands are smaller and may go away, but in other cases some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands and we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands, but again it\u2019s going to be a positioning and a build. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. But there are some really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward. Hilton H. Schlosberg: Does that answer your question? So it\u2019s a kind of mixture of volume decreases in certain brands that are being addressed and other factors that... Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is open. William B. Chappell: Thanks, good morning. Rodney can you talk a little bit about Mexico from kind of the numbers you were reeling off I couldn\u2019t tell if they were just some short-term turbulence or can you give a little more color, what\u2019s going on there? Rodney Cyril Sacks : There were obviously some challenges in March as we indicated, that is a market that has not transitioned so there is obviously some uncertainty relating to the market. The market we have still grown just short of 10% and so the brand has continually grown quarter-to-quarter, but there is the emergence of a low cost brand Vive 100 in the market that have been very aggressive and they have really expanded the market and that\u2019s why when we look at the market we say our market share has decreased, but is it of a very much increased market and may be a little bit different. And then we had a debate earlier as to does Vive 100 really put into category or do well we really in the premium category and Vive 100 is in a lower price category are they really different and should we be splitting them. And as we think we have traditionally put them into the one category, but that really what\u2019s happens. So if you look at the underlying market bearing the uncertainties et cetera it is still growing and obviously one of the issues is ForEx and affordability, but we are still growing. So we are comfortable with end market, we think it\u2019s a good market and we think that in the future we will continue to see pretty good growth from there. Hilton H. Schlosberg: So since you like numbers, let me quote the number enough for Vive 100, there 340 ml PET which is their leading product in pesos sells for 10 pesos. Our product, a 473ml U.S. product that sold in Mexico sells for 30 pesos to 32 pesos. So that\u2019s the comparison in pricing. It\u2019s a very, very aggressive competitor and we don\u2019t want to go down and we will not go down to that type of pricing for Monster. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan. Your line is open. John A. Faucher: Thank you. Just want to follow-up on the last couple of questions. You\u2019ve talked about sort of preaching patients in terms of getting these bottler deals done totally understand that. Can you tell us what goes into the negotiations, it sounds like some of these sort of brand shifts what the underlying support levels are the transition may be out of some of the Coke Concentrate brands into the Monster brand and how you manage that transition? It sounds like that\u2019s part of the negotiations and so is that why this is taking longer? And so I guess sort of a little bit of color in terms of kind of what you need to nail down with the bottlers as you do these deals? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks :  I think you put into two different buckets, the one bucket is although we are trying to get us have ourselves the hope further that we will become more integrated into the Coca-Cola System. We are still nevertheless an independent publicly traded company and as a result it\u2019s been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe will put us in a position where we can take protect ourselves and our brand if things -- the relationships didn\u2019t go as planned. And so the contract that we have agreed to with the company as a principle and obviously now you take that to the individual bottlers they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of license, very respectfully many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as oppose to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things.  The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don\u2019t get into a situation, we have a large line of products for example and we don\u2019t want to be in a position that if the bottler decide he wants to take one skew or three skews and not the rest that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements and we\u2019re getting through them, but it\u2019s in many case that it\u2019s really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that why we need the protections? Then the other obviously is -- the other bucket is just goes back to the old life money, how do you share the value chain that\u2019s available in the country and it\u2019s just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share and in some cases we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share and we\u2019re not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done. Because you want to move quickly I mean what we going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or whatever long the agreement are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than it\u2019s normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship when they split whatever the split is when they split their value chain the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligations. In our case we do and we don\u2019t want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren\u2019t fairly shared. So it\u2019s been in the negotiation and we just -- we\u2019re getting through them one-by-one and I think that\u2019s really the color I have got I don\u2019t know Hilton if you would like to add to it? Hilton H. Schlosberg: No, I think that\u2019s absolutely right. One of the big issues the legal stuff can be negotiated and it is but it\u2019s got to be a fair agreement in terms -- on commercial terms for us and a fair agreement for the bottler and often the bottler feels he is entitled to more and we as a brand owner have substantial expenses, have substantial marketing expenses and we have to ensure that after those marketing expenses we do a good deal for our shareholders. So it is a bit of a hedging, but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized we\u2019re moving forward and we\u2019ll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won\u2019t. And if it\u2019s not there are other distribution partners that we\u2019ll be working with. Rodney Cyril Sacks : Yes I agree. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Caroline levy from CLSA. Your line is open. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much, good morning. My question relates to margins which were just outstanding in the quarter 840 basis points improvement I believe and as you move into the next four quarters I believe you\u2019ll get about a 250 basis points left from the benefit of the acquisition. So I just want to\u2026 Hilton H. Schlosberg: So it\u2019s your estimate. Caroline Levy : Yeah I just want to be sure that within the margin expansion we did see there were no unusual items in the first quarter and obviously there is the benefit of the acquisition which will continue I think through most of the second quarter. But if there are any moving parts you can elaborate on little bit more on margins or is this the new status quo the\u2026 Rodney Cyril Sacks : We spoke about the price increase number one; number two, we\u2019ve got the Concentrate business has now kicked in it wasn\u2019t in the first quarter of last year. So those are two factors that influenced margin in this quarter. There is product mix, which has also influenced margin so apart from those I\u2019m not aware of anything unusual apart from those that influenced margin in the quarter. Caroline Levy : And I'm wondering if you could\u2026 Rodney Cyril Sacks : And in going forward yes we will have the benefit of the AFF transaction. Caroline Levy : Yeah just because I think the strategic is the million dollar question on the company is do you think overtime international margins get pretty close to domestic and I mean we could talk in 5 or 10 year increments I guess is there a reason why international structurally would always be below the U.S.? Hilton H. Schlosberg: Well pricing differs from country to country obviously and we have very good pricing in the U.S. and in some countries internationally we don\u2019t benefit from the same pricing structures. So what we\u2019ve done we don\u2019t give projections as you know, we don\u2019t give guidance, but what we\u2019ve done in this quarter is we\u2019ve actually given you the margins in the international territories in aggregate so you can see the trends in margin in EMEA and the trends in Asia Pacific and Central and South America. Rodney Cyril Sacks : I think I\u2019d like to just add is that if you look at international margins I think we should expect them to be lower than U.S. because of pricing and in many of those cases our cost of goods seems to be higher, we\u2019re producing out of the U.S. particularly for the -- in the immediate future when volumes really get to the levels of the U.S. we\u2019ll see some reduction but even then I think we should expect cost of goods to be higher internationally. The other thing is that we go through the -- in looking at the mix it\u2019s a mix bag Caroline because even internationally we\u2019ve obviously got Concentrate business, which has got traditionally the higher margins, but as Monster and we think that ultimately the growth in the long-term for the company is that the Monster brand will grow while again we think we will get growth from the new brand there is some nice brands in the strategic group that will continue to grow as well. If you looked -- if we looked at it we think that ultimately the larger growth will come from Monster and then as Monster there will be a -- because they\u2019re international there will be some slight reduction in overall margin, but you want to take the mix\u2026 Hilton H. Schlosberg: Because it\u2019s a finished goods margin. Rodney Cyril Sacks : Correct. And that\u2019s [indiscernible]. So again I just want to bear that in mind so there I am conscious like a I think just a straight line and then take the incremental margin we should get from AAF and should be applied going forward. So while we do expect there to be an improvement in some immediate factors that one should take into account. Hilton H. Schlosberg: And we don\u2019t give predictions. Operator : Thank you and I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks : On behalf of Monster I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.  We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink product throughout the world comprised of our Monster energy brand together with the strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect, everyone have a great day.",

Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Monster Beverage Corporation's Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session with instructions following at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please begin. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed April 29, 2016, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 4, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. As you are, no doubt aware, sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving the effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified Dutch tender stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF transaction expenses of $3.6 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million. Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster's non-energy business for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million. Fourth, we accounted for the AFF transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805 for business combinations. The effect on contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the three months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF transaction, were recorded at fair value and were not recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter. As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. Had these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF's sales to third-party customers, after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter. Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016 and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter. Let me turn to the results for the six months ended June 2016. The results for the six months ended June 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchase expenses of $1.6 million, AFF transaction expenses of $4.5 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $28.7 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million. B, net sales in the first six months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million. C, the results of the comparable six months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million, but the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's non-energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: There was a gain on the sale of the Monster non-energy business. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Yes. Our discussion earlier regarding the AFF raw material cost savings during the quarter is applicable in the same manner and to the same extent to the first half of 2016. Consequently, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with many Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter and are planning to commence distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commence distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Caribbean. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia and Macedonia in the second quarter and anticipate commencing distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully transitioned Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter. Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in eight additional African countries, with a number of additional countries in Africa, mainly in North Africa, to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria. We've also completed the registration of our products in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and a number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters, as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our plans to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch. Although we have reached an advanced stage of negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China, commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and/or early in the fourth quarter. We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activities of AFF have been in accordance with expectations, we did not account for the full benefits of the transaction during the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by approximately $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors. The company commenced a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender offer resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at a price of $156 per share. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016 and as a result, was unable to obtain the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. On August 2, 2016 the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. There are limited sales of finished products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustments for certain items in both quarters previously described, namely acceleration of deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to, one, the TCCC (12:40) transaction, two, the AFF transaction and three, the share repurchase, as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's non-energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to. I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any effects relating to, A, the manner of accounting pursuant to the AFF transaction in the quarter as opposed to future quarters, and B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer. In the second quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Strategic Brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy Drinks segment; two, no sales in the three months ended June 30, 2016 of the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC (14:14) transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of the majority of the former warehouse segment in the Peace Tea brand, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy Drinks segment; three, lower costs of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16-ounce Monster product which was implemented at the end of August 2015. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2%, as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the two principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola, and stock-based compensation on a non-cash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by a reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million. Distributor termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter, as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter, as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter, after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $200.2 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2016, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 7.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 0.4%, sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.8%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.3%, sales of Rockstar increased 10.5%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.4% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 2.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 5.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was down 5.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.3%, Rockstar was up 7%, 5-Hour was down 2.7% and AMP was down 34.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 Monster market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.1 points over the same period last year to 35.3%. NOS' share decreased 0.3 points to 3.5% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.8 points to 35.5%. Rockstar share was up 0.3 of a point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to at 8.2% and AMP share decreased 0.8 of a point to 1.4%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 14.2% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 28.9% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 25, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%. Monster sales decreased 2% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 4 share points to 28.2%, Red Bull sales decreased 3% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 38.6%, Rockstar sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 18.6%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.4% during the month of June, Monster sales increased 4.2%, our market share decreased 7.6 points to 24.5% against the comparable period last year, sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 1.8%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 14.9% and its market share decreased by 7.9 points to 13.1%. Vive 100's market share increased 20.2 points to 41.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4 points to 10%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain, from 18.7% to 22.7% in France, from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany, from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain, from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium, from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden, from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway, from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic and from 6% to 7.4% in the Netherlands. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended June 2016 from 27.2% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended May 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.2% to 9.6%. Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016 compared to 15.6% last year and Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.8% to 22.3% in June, compared to the same period last year, and according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 32.7% to 39.2% in June of 2016. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movement in the quarter. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $77.4 million for the second quarter, as compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region were 30% higher than the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter. EMEA sales continued to be negatively impacted during the quarter by supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in EMEA, during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster's continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the EMEA region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 20.1% or 10.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 170% or 188.8% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 339.7% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory destocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster's sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015. Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015. As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year, and are working on additional new products that we are planning to introduce early in 2017. We estimate July 2016 gross sales on a foreign-exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S. and several countries, we had two less selling days this year compared to last year, a reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August. Two, according to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago. Three, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming Call of Duty promotion, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. And four, for the reasons and factors just discussed, we reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. We believe that we'll be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commencing with the third quarter, and that this transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch late in the third quarter. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. And seven, finally, we have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our first question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Hi, Judy. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So first question is just looking at the U.S. trend. I guess the gross sales number in July, I know you called out the less shipping day issue, but just broadly, it seems like maybe trends are a little bit softer in the measured channel data. So first, what do you think is driving that? Secondly, how much is the non-measured, the non-traditional channel, really adding to the growth, because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy. And then my second question is just on Latin America. It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil, and just trying to get a sense of, is this more of a staged transition, where you're going into certain regions within that country with one bottle and then you roll out to other bottlers? Or how much of this could really have an impact in the more near-term? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We got to get you to start asking single questions, because our memory is not good enough to have all six of them all answered. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It's really two. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Two, but the two gets subdivided into categories. I'm not quite sure how many they are. But okay. Just going back to what, I think, everybody has noticed that there's been a slight decline in the monthly or 4-week or 13-week numbers coming out of Nielsen for the category. And you saw that in the numbers, as we indicated earlier now, and I think, Judy, you published numbers over the past couple of months as well, and it showed there has been a decline. Monster has grown ahead \u2013 is growing ahead of the category, which I think is the important news, and we're continuing to take share, and that's in all the major channels. What has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other major channels, traditionally or historically, we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we're now starting to grow \u2013 we were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channels. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at all measured, we're actually growing more in all measured than the convenience. We still believe that the trends are healthy for Monster. If we look at the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green, is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally, as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting growth again in lines that had sort of leveled off a little bit like Rehab and the juice lines, they're both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is the Java line; in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line generally is up at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter. So that's where we see the numbers. Obviously, the non-measured channels are also growing. Wal-Mart has been \u2013 is a big \u2013 an important customer for us, and those channels are growing. And that's why even in relation to July, I did want to mention that we looked at the all measured channels for the 4 weeks because that continues to grow at 7.5%. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Judy, there's two points I would like to make. Firstly, the benefit of the Coca-Cola transaction is, in fact, in the drug and retail channels, as well as in the non-measured channels, and we are making significant progress with the Coca-Cola organization in the non-measured channel. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Then, Judy, just going to your second question. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Which one of the two questions \u2013 the two remaining questions do you want answered first, Judy? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : (38:07) Operator : Pardon me, Judy. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hello? Operator : Yes. Your line is open. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Sorry. Can you hear me now? I think I was cut off from the queue. I think I'm still mute. Oh, am I on? Okay, because I can't hear. Anyway, I was trying to just get a better sense of your Latin America transition and whether you're transitioning to one bottler at different stages or is this just more of a broader rollout into Mexico and Brazil from a transition standpoint? I can't hear anything. Can you hear? Operator : Pardon me. I'm still on. I think we're having technical difficulties. Wait one second, ladies and gentlemen. Please stand by. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hello? Rodney? Hilton? Can you hear me? I don't understand. All right. We can't hear you, Rodney and Hilton. I think people could hear me. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by, your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please stand by, your conference will resume momentarily. Speakers have rejoined and you still have Judy Hong is still on. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Judy, can you hear us? Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I can hear you now. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : (41:28) Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, and I apologize for my two questions and then... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sorry, we just get focused on one, and then we just lose track of the other one. What was the other question we were still \u2013 you wanted to ask me? Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It was related to Latin America. You talked about transitioning in Mexico and Brazil and I just wanted to get some color on whether this is one bottler you're transitioned or is this the broader country in both...? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, that's fine. What was happening was you have FEMSA that has a lot of areas in which they have operations. And even though they're in different countries, they don't necessarily fill up (42:04) the whole country. So ultimately, we spent a lot of time ultimately in negotiating and getting to a deal with FEMSA. Once we're done there, it didn't facilitated moving quite quickly with other bottlers in each of these different countries. So as we indicated in the call, we have transitioned the whole of Mexico to all of the bottlers that comprised the Coca-Cola group in Mexico, and that has already started as of last week. In the case of the planned transition in Brazil, it will be to all of the bottlers at the same time. The whole group of bottlers have signed agreements with us. We're waiting until that all has happened at one time, and we will transition the whole country on November 1. In the case of Chile, there are two bottlers, we are going to the whole country. In the case of Brazil \u2013 sorry, Colombia, there may be some small areas, but really it pretty much is FEMSA. We've already transitioned Peru, and we will be transitioning the other countries. So it will be pretty much the whole area. We will also be starting Central America and going to countries at a time in the Caribbean. We will be making that quite extensively, and that's not the same, for example, in which I indicated in China, where we are looking at \u2013 at the three main bottlers, but we are looking at that as such a big country, we're looking at selected areas and selected operating units first to go into then to launch in the second area with the second bottler, then in the third area, which are large towns, for example, we are looking at focusing in Beijing, in Shanghai and in Guangzhou, those areas, and then launching and then going to rolling it out to the different BU, operating units as we go forward. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: And let's not forget about OXXO and how important OXXO is in Latin America as well. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, and so we have come to \u2013 that was part of the arrangements that we know you spent time negotiating with those two \u2013 with FEMSA and all of the two principal bottlers. That is correct, and so that is a more extensive rollout over the next \u2013 coming months in Latin America. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Morris of Bank of America. Your line is open. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good evening, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good evening. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just on the Mutant launch, you talked about being in advanced stages. If you could just talk a little bit about the sort of the planned size of the rollout, just the channels. Is it just going to be focused on C-stores initially or other channels as well? And then just \u2013 it would be helpful is just if you've launched other kind of new platforms, not necessarily flavor extensions, but new platforms like this, how additive has it been to your sales growth in let's say the first 12 months to 18 months? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that each country is unique. Where we've been in countries, and we've transitioned, you obviously are going into all channels. Where you run into smaller countries, particularly where you got a bottler with good connections with some of the measured channels of the modern trade, you are going to the independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time. Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the down the street and the independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't \u2013 there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These are being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers, when we're able to properly terminate on due notice to our existing bottlers if there are bottlers in those markets and \u2013 we will then go into markets. I mean, you take Argentina, there we haven't gone into the market \u2013 in that market, we are at the moment engaged in planning production and looking at the changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully, we will come to an agreement with them and then plan a launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning process than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D in the third quarter and C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers are \u2013 get more instant distribution and our sales are at a higher rate. Some markets, it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity. It has a different velocity to traditional beverages; it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high-volume accounts. It needs to be bought in the smaller stores where it's served cold and sold cold, one can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers and it takes time. So there is no magical ramp-up the day you start that you have a magical set of things. It just takes time and builds and continues to build. So we're at the stage where we really are transitioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and these are going to continue to build over the rest of this year and in 2017. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Yes. And what I would say is, while we don't give guidance, I think, you can look at some markets that have been transitioned. We spoke, for example, on the call about Germany, which was transitioned last year. We spoke about South Korea, and you can look at some of those markets. I'm not saying that's indicative of all markets going forward, but certainly there's been a lot of progress with some of the Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. And we do expect good \u2013 that's why the transaction was done, we expect good performance from those bottlers as we go forward. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I agree. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, two questions. One, quickly, just why was concentrate or the strategic brands, Coke brands, whatever you're calling it these days, why was that better? And is that sort of a good run rate to use on a go-forward basis? And then second question, not to confuse you, but I think it's fairly straightforward. So on China, beyond negotiations with Coke bottlers, is there anything else that prevents you from commencing distribution? Like is there any formula or manufacturing approvals that are still needed? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Let me deal with the China first. In the case of China, we already have product approvals, and we have manufacturing approvals, with two of the three bottlers. With the third bottler, we have product approval and we're pretty much, I think, we're almost through with the product, I don't think we've actually seen it, but I think it should be imminent, and then we'll go through the manufacturing approval process. We don't see any problem with that. It's already been approved by two independent Chinese authorities or provinces and that should be fine. And even if there were some technical hiccups, we could supply product from the Shanghai area, for example, to one of the other areas, and produce it there. So those shouldn't be issues. We just \u2013 obviously, we are in the planning stages. We're just trying to get to the finish line on a couple of issues, on the value chains and the sharing and basically just some contractual terms. We think we should be, be there. It started off with a very big laundry list and we're down to a very few items now. So, we're quite comfortable that we will get there. On the strategic brands, on the run rate, you didn't have a full quarter last year, whereas you did have the full quarter this year. The full quarter... Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: (50:35) only completed on June 15, 2015, so you're comparing that to a full quarter in 2016. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. And so basically, I think, if you take the \u2013 what you will get in the 10-Q, you'll get the breakout in the sectors, and you will get \u2013 which will now be called the strategic brand sector, you will get the numbers in that sector, which will give you, we think, to be \u2013 which will be indicative of future quarters and the run rate. But again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of finished product in sales in that sector, which it doesn't \u2013 it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, it obviously may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we are saying that, and pulling it out, and that's why we're putting it into the different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S., we converted the 22-ounce plastic bottle, sort of that unique NOS bottle, but wasn't really practical to have produced and shipped and on shelves, and we converted that and changed it into our 24-ounce resealable can. So we re-launched the 24-ounce resealable can. It is a good product and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who are manufacturing NOS off a concentrate model do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cap-can. So we are having it manufactured and supplied on a finished product basis. So again, there are some anomalies like this, there is a little bit of finished products in Germany on strategic products, because we changed Relentless into a 355-ml slim can. And again, the Coke production plant that was producing Relentless in a 500-ml can before we made the change to the design to the packaging and the pack size, didn't have either the capacity or the ability, I'm not sure which, but \u2013 to do so, so we are producing it at one of our co-packers and selling finished product. So that might have an effect on your sale proceeds and slightly smaller margins, because of just the nature of selling concentrate at a higher margin. But we think at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Good evening. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Evening. Hi, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. So a quick clarification on the July sales update. That was selling-day adjusted, correct \u2013 or was not selling day adjusted for two days, so... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's wasn't. That's our actual estimate, and we are saying that, we actually had 10% less selling days. I mean, that's why we made that point, yes. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : So it's something closer to like high-single digits. Is that fair? On a selling day adjusted basis? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're not going to extrapolate, but we think that, obviously, that does happen, I mean, if you're selling, you're selling, and you just don't have those deliveries. So, it's a delivery up and that's why we again pointed to the fact that the retail sale numbers going out of the store is up substantially higher than, for example, our sales are showing. And that's why we really are cautious because this single month is a very, very difficult month to start trying to look at and look at trends and this happens to be one of those months where we looked \u2013 we can all see the number and say, okay, but you look at these other factors, and we just don't feel there's any significance to it. But that's how we read, and we run the business more on a trend basis than a single period of time. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Understood. Thanks for the clarification there. And Hilton, another point of clarity; on the gross margin, if I understood you correctly, you had an unfavorable impact of $24 million on cost of goods, so the top line was very strong in the quarter, I guess, relative to expectations. The margins came in a bit lower than consensus expectations, but is it fair to say that the gross margin would have been closer to about 66% on a pro forma basis, adjusting for that? And number one, is that fair? And number two, is that sort of a reasonable expectation going forward here? Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Okay, firstly, we don't give guidance. So, I'm not going to comment on gross margins going forward. What I can tell you is that, in the quarter, because of the accounting and for the consolidation of AFF, we did not get the benefit of the lower cost of goods in this quarter because we had the inventory, and they had the inventory and everything was related to fair value adjustment. So we did not get the benefit of the, A, lower cost of sales in this quarter. We will get it in subsequent quarters. If you look at what that number should have been had we not had to account for \u2013 on these fair value adjustment methods, we would've added $24 million to our gross profit. And whatever that percentage is, that's what the percentage is. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Very good. All right, that's helpful. Just one more for me, if I could come back to Mutant and Hydro. Hilton, can you talk a little bit about the receptivity from retailers, particularly in the convenience channel, which is what you're targeting at this point? And a little bit on your level of confidence that you're going to get the type of merchandising and shelving that you want. And that is sort of at a different point in the cooler from the existing portfolio. Just sort of minimize cannibalization there. And then also maybe if you could just give us a little bit of clarity on the Hydro launch and when you anticipate that hitting. Thank you very much for your time. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: So sales teams have been not making calls on Mutant, and many of the retailers, many of the major retailers, and in general, the reception has been good. I'm not sure that of any negatives that have been portrayed so far. We have very specific merchandising objectives for this product. It's not going to compromise our space or the Coca-Cola space. So we've very specific merchandising objectives, and all I can say, and I don't want to say too much, but the launch is proceeding in accordance with plan, and the communication with the retailers is also proceeding in accordance with plan. We have not had any negatives to speak of. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right, then of the Hydro side, we are dealing with the planning on that product, but we really focusing on getting Mutant down into the market and doing that and we have our sales team and obviously the Coke bottlers have theirs, so you want to focus on one thing at a time. We do propose to follow with Hydro launch. We think that may still be \u2013 we're anticipating in the fourth quarter. Again, it may be subject to getting the cooperation and the ability of the bottlers to focus when they get to that holiday season that does become a bit tight. But subject to that, we should be able to get Hydro after, again, later in the fourth quarter. And then we do have one or two additional product \u2013 innovation product lines, one particular one planned for launch towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. But again, depending on simply timing, we may get the products done and shipped at the end of year, but probably will be fully launched in January or late January. So there is the sort of the innovation pipeline going forward. There are a number of individual items that we are still also looking at introducing in this period in the next couple of months \u2013 next six months. Operator : Thank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our product through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a robust portfolio of energy drink product throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as for our new Mutant product line. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales were $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The Company achieved record gross sales of $913.3 million up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million respectively for the 2015 third quarter was positively impacted by advance purchases made by the Company\u2019s customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the Company\u2019s Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The Company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and the $11 million respectively as a result of such advance purchases. Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster\u2019s net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix.  Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1%, compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses including marketing, research and social media were the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. In-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola, and stock-based compensation and non-cash item was 3.3 million higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter, as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety. and sale of the Company\u2019s product were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter, as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters particularly in China were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a one-time benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In United States, we\u2019re continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and we\u2019ll transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time, as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. After a slow start, we\u2019re seeing better execution in South Africa. During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and transitioned Swaziland, R\u00e9union and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. As we previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2016, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago.

Rockstar share was down 0.1 of 1 point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.5 points and 7.6%, and AMP share decreased 0.6 points to 1.5%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 19.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 18.2% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 21.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended August 20, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%. Monster sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.6 share points to 31.3%, Red Bull sales decreased 4% and its market share increased 0.2 points to 39.2%, Rockstar sales decreased 11% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 15.6%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.3% during the month of September 2016. Monster sales increased 12.6%, our market share in value decreased 4.7 points to 22.3% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 28.4%, although Burn\u2019s market share decreased 0.3 points of 1 point to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100\u2019s market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost\u2019s market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain, from 19.4% to 22.6% in France, from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany, from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain, from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium, from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden, from 6% to 11% in Norway, from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic and from 6.1% to 6.4% in the Netherlands. According to IRI, Monster\u2019s market share in Greece decreased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended September 2016 from 28.4% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended August 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster\u2019s retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.6% to 11.2%. And for the 13-week period September 2016 Monster\u2019s retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, a new low-priced energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year and Monster\u2019s market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.6% in September 2016, as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased from 10.7% to 23.7% in September, compared to the same period last year, and according to INTAGE, Monster\u2019s market share value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 41.7% in September of 2016. According to IRI, in Australia Monster\u2019s market share in value grew from 3.5% to 6% in September 2016 and in New Zealand Monster\u2019s market share in value grew from 2.2% to 6% for the last four weeks ending October 2, 2016 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Company\u2019s Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were now sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S. including our Java Monster line bodes well for the future. However, their exists limited production in the U.S. for such products which requires a rethought process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. Due to production capacity constraints, resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages have been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of month before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. Net sales for customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to a $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the Company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies, over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016. However, although Nielsen reported Monster\u2019s market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 59.4 days at September 30, 2015. In late September, we launch Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we\u2019re planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we previously announced. On October 14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016 each stockholder of record will receive two additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock owned at the close of business Eastern Time on October 26, 2016. We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign-exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the Company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commenced with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the Company\u2019s earnings. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was on balance not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the UK, our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our Latin American results. On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. The new additions to the monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the Company\u2019s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I would like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi, everyone. So, Rodney, I guess just maybe you can help us quantify how much the production shortages in Java perhaps hurt the Q3 reported sales and then the October number? Because it looks like in Q3, I know the advance purchases last year was a tough comp but even beyond that it looks like, there was a pretty sizeable gap between reported and the takeaway data. And then just secondly on China, maybe, you can just help us what you\u2019ve seen so far in terms of the launches you\u2019ve done in Beijing and Shanghai, and what\u2019s been the response to the launches? I know it\u2019s early, but just any color there would be great. Rodney Sacks : Hilton will speak about the coffee Java issue, if you\u2019re able to. It\u2019s been difficult for us, because we\u2019re just trying to get a handle on what impact it\u2019s had with different bottlers, because again, it\u2019s affected different bottlers in a different way, and we were not certain of how much inventory they\u2019ve had. What we have seen is that in stores there have been signs put up by our major competitor who we also had shortages. So it\u2019s really been difficult to determine. I think it affected our October number probably more than our September number, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re trying to get handle on that at the moment. If you\u2019re able to give any more color? Hilton Schlosberg : Judy, we are really trying to get and exercise together because there was some inventory that we had obviously in the system that we were able to get out in the quarter. But we\u2019re still reviewing those numbers and we\u2019ll be in a better position to talk about that sometime later. But I think there will be a more pronounced impact in Q4. Rodney Sacks : Judy with regard to your second question on China, basically the way we launch generally is through a soft launch and to go into the smaller stores, independent convenience stores first and start to get the product established and sampled cold. Today, we probably secured probably of the order, and it\u2019s a very rough guess from what we\u2019ve discussed with our bottlers, about 50,000 accounts in the areas where we\u2019ve already launched. We will be going into Guangzhou, Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So, we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so, we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us, it\u2019s a very big country. Probably by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in probably areas that would be covered by about 18% of the population or and those areas represent our estimate at the moment is about 30-33% of the current energy market, once we\u2019ll have got through December. So, it\u2019s a big market and we\u2019re obviously planning to do -- there is little bit of -- there will be a bit of a hiatus between beginning of January and until off the Chinese New Year. But once we\u2019re through that, then we\u2019re going to start focusing on launching pre-summer in China. Obviously that will be the thrust of our focus. Hilton Schlosberg : But we can also say Judy that the teams are satisfied with the results and the bottlers are excited about the results, we\u2019ve seen so far. So, it will help us well for the future. Rodney Sacks : One thing I just wanted to clarify, I talked about the October gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis 12.3; this was actually 12.6; the unadjusted basis was 12.3, just to give that clarification. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : The October number, wanted to come back that again, are there any differences in selling days from a year ago? And also if you could quantify roughly what the impact is from Mutant sell in or even China I guess would be helpful. And then just to go back to sort of the quarter itself. So, by my math, your U.S. legacy sales were down something like 1% in the third quarter; the scanner data shows up something, I don\u2019t know, mid to high single-digits roughly. We know you talk about benefits from on track channel in the past. So, could you help just sort of quantify what is going on there, was there some selling ahead of third quarter; is there pent-up demand out there from an inventory standpoint, just sort of helping to reconcile that would be good? Hilton Schlosberg : There is a whole bunch of questions. [Multiple speakers] Can you just start and then we can answer them one at a time? Mark Astrachan : Okay, October. So, selling days, this year versus last year and then incremental benefits from Mutant in China? Rodney Sacks : Okay. We\u2019ll get to you that because we just don\u2019t have it handy. Mark Astrachan : Okay. And then, the other is, I calculated down one for your legacy U.S. business sales in the third quarter, obviously the scanner data has been better than that. So what gives? Rodney Sacks : I think on the legacy sales, it\u2019s just the timing issue. Mark Astrachan : Okay. [Multiple speakers]. Rodney Sacks : Not there is any destocking or restocking or anything of that nature. Hilton Schlosberg : Whenever we sell a concentrate with the legacy brands. And so what we -- what we see in Nielsen and what we are selling in concentrate is quite a significant disconnect, it\u2019s not even as if we\u2019re selling a finished product. We do sell finished products but in main, you talk about concentrate and there is a huge lag between where the concentrate is manufactured by the bottlers and then sold in the market and sold to consumers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes the Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Laurent Grandet : I would like to understand a bit more about Mutant. I know, I mean it\u2019s very early stage right now. And it\u2019s kind of a double effort [ph] for you in terms of profitability. So, any kind of calculation -- cannibalization between Mutant and your energy core brands would be helpful for us to understand. If it\u2019s a good start and is there some legs in the future, could you give us some more color on this? Rodney Sacks : Again, it\u2019s been very early days on Mutant, but we\u2019ve had some insight from three or four of the what we\u2019d call representative or convenience chains. And the Mutant sales as a percentage of Mountain Dew, which is the main competitor, they are obviously going after, has been quite good. It varies quite a bit between the stores but whichever way you look at the percentages, it\u2019s quite respectable. And everybody, including the retailers, have been quite surprised and quite happy with the sell-in. The actual level of Mutant that was sold in the quarter, I think that is Mark\u2019s question -- one of Mark\u2019s questions earlier was about 4.5 million in our numbers on a gross basis. And so, it really started late and it\u2019s really just starting to ramp up now. And the whole strategy that we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant generally, is we never intended at any time, it\u2019s how we\u2019ve launched all of our products, we didn\u2019t intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day one. It\u2019s a bubbling up, we put it into convenience stores, we are being very specific about way we want to see it placed in the store and we feel that\u2019s important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we\u2019ve got is that there is very, very minimal, if any cannibalization. So, we are achieving we believe our strategic objective to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster Energy Drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across the board getting retailers buy in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that. And in some cases, for that reason, we have not sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very board acceptance and buying from retailers. And so far we are actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand. Tom Kelly : Also Mark, to answer your question, it was one extra day, selling day in October 2016 versus 2015. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Vivien Azer : So, I was hoping, please, if you could just comment on the broader health of the energy drinks category. Given the torrid rates of growth that we\u2019ve seen historically, I think it\u2019s not unexpected to see the growth rate moderate. Do you feel like kind of this new run rate is sustainable or is there any kind of exogenous headwinds that you think may be weighing on category sales? Rodney Sacks : Yes. That\u2019s $1 million or $64 question -- $64,000 question. We have seen some sort of settling in the energy category. However, we\u2019ve also got to bear in remind that I think over this period, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of innovation. Our innovation, we\u2019ve been dealing with new packaging, different packaging, it\u2019s taken some time for us to get our hands around it. And so, if you take for example high growth coming out, we\u2019re looking at the beginning of next year, Mutant really has just hit the shelves, just pretty days before the quarter-end. And our Cafe Monster product, which we\u2019re looking at launching next year also it will come through next year sometime. We will have to obviously deal with the production issues, it\u2019s one of the things -- one of the challenges we\u2019ll face with Cafe Monster. But we think that if you\u2019re looking at innovation, it really was probably pretty limited this year and that we think has been one of the reasons. But again, the category is more positive, it\u2019s gone up and down over in the past, and we do believe that we will continue to see some increase in growth rates next year. But again, this is -- we don\u2019t have any crystal ball to be able to do so. Hilton Schlosberg : One of the other growth opportunities for us is in the non-traditional channels which are not measured by Nielsen? And we make a lot of headway with the Coca-Cola system in some of these non-traditional channels. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Two detail-oriented questions from you. First on the getting back to the October sales update. Do you have the split between U.S. and international? That would be helpful just to kind of gauge how the U.S. may look versus what we\u2019re currently seen in the Nielsen data, and any potential benefit there with shipments with respect to Mutant. That\u2019s question number one if you have that handy. And question number two, the selling and distribution expense was elevated; you spoke to some of this in your prepared remarks. I know you don\u2019t guide specifically. But given the push here internationally, particularly in China and a number of other markets, should that remain elevated -- should we expect that to remain elevated in the near to intermediate term? Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. If we could talk about the numbers for October. The U.S. grew by just under 10%, 9.8%. And you can work out regarding international. So that\u2019s the number for the U.S. Your second question on selling and operating expenses, obviously what we spoke about in the quarter was an increase -- a significant increase in endorsement and sponsorship costs and that\u2019s something that maybe grow as we go forward, depending on when it takes the brand from a marketing perspective. So, we don\u2019t give guidance and I broadly not give any guidance on selling expenses because a lot of that will determine on a number of initiatives that we\u2019re considering at this time. Regarding operating expenses, I think there is -- the operating expenses other than selling expenses i.e. the admin expenses are probably largely in line where they will be in the foreseeable future of course depending on a lot of these legal costs and relating to the regulatory aspects and some of the -- the case is that we are still involved in, which are in fact reducing in number. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Thank you. Rodney Sacks : So, one of the things that -- the bumps that came in the series was the -- take on staff to really support the sales and marketing, put some marketing behind the strategic brands as we continue to -- we\u2019re getting our hands around them, we may be able to look at some sort of rationalization on some of those costs going forward as we get to know the brands better and we get more focused on how we want to position these strategic brands going forward. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On the half of Monster, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated March 1, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. On October 14, 2016, we announced a three-for-one stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading at the split adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly all per share amounts; common stock outstanding, and common stock repurchase, presented on this call have been adjusted retroactively where applicable to reflect the stock split. Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales was $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million respectively for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advanced purchases made by the companies customers due to a pre-announced price increase, effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million respectively, as a result of such advanced purchases. Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advanced purchase increased by 14.8% and 12.4% respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, they increased in absolute dollars. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premiums. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter. Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, commercial ingredients, used safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased to 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor terminations expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expense for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters respectively. Turning to the full-year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full-year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, totaling $31 million and $22.3 million respectively for the year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015. Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years respectively. We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. Domestically we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola Bottlers early in January 2017 and are making good progress in the United States in non-traditional channels including Foodservice accounts. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Bahrain, Mauritius, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Nigeria and Oman with additional launches planned in the second quarter of 2017 for Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, and Pakistan. In LATAM, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we transitioned distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, and Panama. In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean and transitioned distribution to Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain other smaller markets in that geographic region. In China, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in selected markets that includes Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan in China. We also commenced distribution in the Maldives in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have received approval for our products in India and are planning to re-launch Monster in India later this year. As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $22 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13-weeks through February 18, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.6 of a percent versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 0.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 7.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.3%. Sales of Red Bull increased 0.8 of a percent, sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.9 of a percent, sales of 5-Hour decreased 5.7% and sales of AMP decreased 24.6%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 0.1 of a percent over the same period last year. Sales of Monster decreased by 0.9 of a percent over the same period last year while NOS was up 6.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 6.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.7 of a percent, Rockstar was down 4.5%, 5-Hour was down 8.5%, and AMP was down 25.5%. We pointed out that the energy shots category has been declining for some time and if we exclude the energy shots category, Energy Plus Coffee and Protein Drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages. For the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars in fact increased by 1.4% over the same period last year. And on this basis, sales of Monster increased by 1.6%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars decreased by 0.4 of a point over the same period last year to 35%. NOS share increased 0.2 of a point to 4.3% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.1 of a point to 1%. Red Bull share increased 0.2 of a point to 34.7%, Rockstar share was down 0.4 of a point to 8%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.7 of a point to 7.6% and AMP decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.3%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales of Energy Plus Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.7% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 12.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12-weeks ended January 7, 2017, the energy drink category decreased 5% in dollars, due largely to lower pricing of private label brands. Monster sales increased 1% versus year ago. Our market share increased 1.8 share points to 30%, Red Bull sales decreased 2% and its market share increased 0.9 of a point to 38.2%, Rockstar sales decreased 6% and its market share decreased 0.2 of a point to 18.7%. According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 23.9% during the month of January 2017. Monster sales increased 22.3%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 of a point to 26.8% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 22.7%. Burn's market share decreased two points to 3.4%. Red Bull sales decreased 8.9% and its market share decreased by 4.1 points to 11.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 9.6 points to 37.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4.8 points to 13.6%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016, while initially slow has since improved and we are now seeing wider availability of Monster in the traditional freight channel in Mexico. According to Nielsen, Monster's new medical distribution in the traditional freight channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month which was a short period that may offer be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the offshore convenience chain which dominate the market. Sales in the offshore convenience chain turn to be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drinks brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in a 13-week period ended December 2016, the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.5% to 15.4% in Great Britain, from 20.3% to 22.9% in France, from 13.4% to 15.2% in Germany, from 8.7% to 9.5% in Italy, from 8.9% to 12.4% in Ireland, from 7.1% to 10.9% in Norway, and from 8.8% to 12% in the Czech Republic. In the same period, Monster's market share grew from 10.9% to 11.1% in Sweden, from 8.7% to 10.5% in Belgium, and from 23.8% to 27.2% in Spain. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ending December 2016 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 6.7% to 5% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ending December 2016 grew from 15.8% to 16% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased in the 13-weeks ended December 2016 from 28.2% to 28.5%. I would like to point out that Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels raised by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 26.9% in January 2017 as compared to 19.9% last year and also just two months since the KO bottler system, Monster's market share in value in Brazil grew to 5% in December 2016 as compared 3.7% in the same period last year. In South Korea Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.3% to 23.7% in December 2016 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 38.6% to 43.3% in December 2016. According to IRI in Australia Monster's market share in value grew from 3.1% to 6.3% in December. Going to IRI in New Zealand Monster's market share in value grew from 2.3% to 5.7% for the last four weeks ending December 4, 2016, versus the same period last year.

Gross sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 14.3% from $677.7 million to $774.8 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million of foreign currency movements. The comparative gross and net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment of $677.7 million and $585.1 million respectively for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advanced purchases made by the companies customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy Brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter for the Monster Energy Drinks segment were reduced by approximately $12 million and $11 million respectively as a result of such advanced purchases. Gross and net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2016 fourth quarter after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparisons for advanced purchases increased by 12.4% and 14.8% respectively. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $64.5 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately 0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales of the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retooled products Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We are taking steps to address the issues including securing products from Europe, but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that sales in the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $22 million as a result of such production capacity shortages. Net sales to customers outside of the United States were $193.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $145.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately $3.3 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in local currencies increased 40% and 33% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 53.4% in the same period last year to 52.8% during the quarter. For the full-year of 2016, net sales increased 36% in local currencies and 30% in dollars over 2015. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.4% in 2015 to 51.1% in 2016. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share throughout Europe in the fourth quarter, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland, and Norway. Monster achieved increased sales guidance as well as increased market share. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 53.1% in dollars and 41.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.6% in the same period last year to 44.1% during the 2016 fourth quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 45.1% or 25.1% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 135.9% or 130.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Guam, net sales increased 3.6%, modest 3.4% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead of plans for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 20.7% in dollars and 23.6% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 19.7% and 21.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.9% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 fourth quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 115.3% in dollars or 117.2% in local currency largely due to the transition of Monster's Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 148.6% in dollars and 137.7% in local currencies. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $377.6 million compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $220.6 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $2.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $448.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.2 days compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015. Inventories increased to $162 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 57 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 58 days at December 31, 2015. In September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting Super Soda in limited convenience store in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. For the 13-weeks ended January 21, 2017, for Nielsen total U.S. convenience, Mutant had the highest dollar share gain of any single served bottling soft drinks brand. For single served packages sold in convenience stores during the same dollars, Mutant outsold a number of well established single served brands such as 7 Up. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We are planning to launch of our new Hydro line which is a non-carbonated largely treated energy drink, is packaged in a unique 16.9 ounce PET can, the size which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro for the retail trade towards the end of March or early April. Monster Energy Ultra Violet was launched exclusively with Sam's Club and will be expanded to all channels at the end of March 2017. We are also planning to launch Full Throttle Orange at the end of March. We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches are planned for the remainder of 2017. We estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.4% higher than in January 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our boxes are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates of which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. With regard to litigation between the Company and the San Francisco City Attorney, we advice that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's Unfair Competition Law, any funding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy Drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold. In consideration of release of clients and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain the various current marketing and labeling practices for its energy drink products through December 31, 2018. On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remains under the previously authorized share repurchase programs. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, as previously reported our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership of our proprietary formulas for our principal products. We recognize the reduction in operating costs of $22 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition. Two, North American and international gross margins remained healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics showed that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter equivalent getting of the first quarter -- equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world showed that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum, and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Bill Chappell : Just a little more color around the fourth quarter on both tenants. You said, lower promotional allowances and then also on the top-line. On the promotional allowances, is that something that that was more year-over-year comparison or is that something that we should expect in general going forward in 2017? And then on the top-line was there, you may be could you break out was there much benefit from kind of the Mutant sell-in, from the China sell-in or was that negligible to kind of the top-line growth? Rodney Sacks : I think most of the answers comparatively based on a quarter by -- comparable quarter for last year. Bill Chappell : Okay. You said it was a benefit to gross profit that's why I was wondering. Rodney Sacks : I think we made the point, Bill, when we spoke about gross profit that the additional promotional allowances in the quarter and other items had the impact of increasing gross profit margin by approximately 2%. So in that I think what we try to suggest that these promotional allowances, the reduction in promotional allowances may not necessarily endure over the quarters in 2017. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Hey guys, just one housekeeping. I think you still need to answer Bill's other question on I think Mutant sell-in. Also my question is just on general sell-in and sell through trends, so you touched on this at the Investor Meeting in January about untracked channels contributing more than you'd seen historically, obviously that disconnect had widened pretty substantially here. So may be if you could sort of touch on what you think is contributing to that and I'm talking specifically about the U.S. may be sort of methodology gathering what you're doing in universities, foodservice, vending et cetera, just sort of much specificity there if you could give would be helpful? Please. Rodney Sacks : We're just dealing with Mutant. Mutant we went through this a few times. We repositioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at the average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant is at average pricing in all the different periods depending which period you look at it's still above 196. If you compare that, that's quite a substantial premium to the other soft drinks and its main competitive soft drink that we're looking at competing, with which is Mountain Dew. And so we have strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer. So when we look at the numbers and we look at the sales per point, we think the sales per point are pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well established brands in the area. If you look at the last four weeks that has dropped off a little bit again because of the -- we believe the lack of promotional spend and behind the brand that that was intentional in this period of time. It is a soda and we are looking to as I expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion that's driving us starts going into spring now. So we are still positive about the brand and its prospects and sell to particularly where we have seen at the substantial price premium, we've seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well established brands that are being around for a long time. Hilton Schlosberg : I think there is one other point that we need to focus on and that is that the permanent shift will be done and the placements will be done in March. So we launched Mutant off-cycle, which means that in many cases the product is on space where the bottlers could find space for the product. And in March, the sets, the new sets will become available in the convenience and gas channel where the product is sold. Rodney Sacks : There are another, couple of other key channels where we have secured listings and we will be. Those are things will start coming through in April and May. So we do have ongoing plans to basically ramp up for put effort and focus behind the brand. Hilton Schlosberg : I think it's also anticipated that the -- this is not a full blowing launch; it is also called a bubble up launch. There is only launch in convenience retail in chains in convenience retail that was rolled out to Mom and Pop to a limited degree and that's where we're at this time. As Rodney said, there will be further listing that have been secured that will take place starting in April. Rodney Sacks : Then just talking about the Mark's question, there is a bigger divergence but that is the fact of matter is that the non-major channel are continuing to expand for us. We are dealing in the non-major area. We also have some concerns about the accuracy and the represented nature of the convenience data which does seem to us to be a little more inaccurate in relation to as compared for example to grocery where we think there is a closer correlation and a better read. And that's just a fact of life. But we are where we are on our sales and we continue to see increases, although clearly there is some softening in the convenience channel. Hilton Schlosberg : And also don't forget that the Java's shortages that we experienced, they also affect. Rodney Sacks : Yes, affect the whole channel and whole category. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma : Hi, just a quick navigation going back to the question there is no case to sort of like the inventory build-up in the channels because of divergent Euro [ph] sales? Rodney Sacks : Sorry. Just say that again? Amit Sharma : So we shouldn't view there is inventory build-up in the channel as suggested by the divergent Euro sales and slowdown in channel, you're not seeing inventory build-up there? Rodney Sacks : No, not that we've seen. And I think that the bottlers would be -- will be building up inventory of Monster in their system either. Amit Sharma : Got it. And then as we think about Hydro launching later this year, would you expect Hydro also to be a bubble up launch or would you expect that to be a little bigger launch more in line with your traditional products? Rodney Sacks : I think it would be -- it will be more in line with our traditional launches. But again we generally do launch through a bubble up process, somewhat more or less extensive but that's generally how we've always launched our products, it's regarding to selective chains and into launch but it will be a more extensive launch than we had for Mutant. Mutant was very exceptional launch and it was very limited by design and by strategy and being off cycle Hydro will be a more broader based launch going out. But clearly initial focus will be on the convenience and gas and independent channels, et cetera. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good evening guys. First one, housekeeping question just point of clarification on the January gross sales update, if I'm not mistaken, there is an extra selling day in the month of January and then I think that there is one less in the first quarter. So Hilton perhaps if you could just clarify that that would be helpful. And then the broader question on Brazil, which looks like it's starting to bounce back now with the distributor change behind you. How high can that share go, how quickly can you guys ramp in that market. Can you give us any sort of parameters for which you think you can grow market share it's like the 27% that you have in Chile is that, is that reasonable and over what period of time. Thanks. Rodney Sacks : I think there is an extra selling day in January. Hilton Schlosberg : Extra selling day in January, that is correct. Rodney Sacks : Yes. And I'm not sure about the quarter but in my review one less in the quarter. We know there is one less in February but we haven't done the exercise. So I think just mathematically that is right. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes, exactly. We're -- just to be clear, I mean, we run our business quarter-by-quarter and while selling days obviously are important because sales have generated on each day. We've never looked at our business and never tried to explain our business based on one or less selling day and I just want to be clear on that. Rodney Sacks : On Brazil, Brazil a very unique market. The country at the moment is struggling obviously talk of it being almost in the depression and so there are challenges. We also have a group of 10 bottlers; it's a little bit different to Chile. Chile there were two main bottlers they really, we started to have some pretty -- we really had some pretty good momentum for the brand. It was well established, it doesn't have a deep distribution but where it was, it was already selling into the high-teens and doing pretty nicely. So when the two Coke bottlers in Chile took it over, they really didn't price the brand and obviously we're able to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market, rather up probably more quickly and more I think efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good. And we've been very encouraged by the results. In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more non-traditional market you have literally well over a million of these little traditional stores all over the place and they are audit get you, audit of service and grow invariably, there is a very, very large and interpret wholesale system that helps get to these stores and it's just you're just not comparing apples-and-apples. So we've got to manage a group of 10 odd bottlers in a very different environment, countries and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that will take some time, but as it has in many of the current markets where you do deal with these very big bottlers or basically groups of bottlers it takes time for them to get coordinated and get their system going. But when it does start going, it does really work, it does improve and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen. We are at a point now where we are selling at a rate which is higher than we've ever sold even when we were with our previous distributor at the peak before we announced the KO transaction and they tended to lose interest in the brand and stop putting the effort behind this because they were also a good distributor. And so we're encouraged by where we're going but it will take time to build up. The good news is that it's a big energy market. We do quite nicely with Burn there and really these by far the largest player is Red Bull. That is really our main competitor and we are at sort of a similar price point, which for us means that we would -- gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull share which is at a premium price and is not at the low-end. They do have low end brands but at least we know there is a lot of good business to be gone off at this but it's going to take time to develop. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Laurent Grandet : Hi Rod, hi Hilton. A quick follow-up on Mutant and you mentioned earlier this year the share that you would be launching in Mutant in Wal-Mart in Q2 this year. Could you please give us a bit more color my understanding was it, it would be about 1,000 stores from April, with its first shipment in March. Should we think now differently or --? Rodney Sacks : I'm not sure, not sure where you got that from. Laurent Grandet : Okay. Well that's I mean a question I ask at some point and to some retailers and so are you; are you confirming or not confirming? Rodney Sacks : Not confirming anything. Laurent Grandet : Okay. So I've got a chance then for a second question. Regarding the on-premise, I mean you mentioned, I mean you're making lots of progress there. Two quarters ago, you mentioned, I mean you are testing in McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts my understanding here is that you would be launching in Dunkin Donuts. So could you abate us on those two tests and either any other big customers we should think off from that you are making progress? Rodney Sacks : Well McDonalds the test is continuing, they don't make mutinous decision, so that test is continuing. And with Dunkin Donuts, we are distributed in a number of their outlets, so that's not. I mean we alluded earlier to the fact that we were launching Mutant in a number of -- number of chains later this year and you can read into that, but certainly one of them is a major retailer. Hilton Schlosberg : I think it's premature at this time to give more detail on that launch. We'll start going through, as we said in spring and then I think that would be in a much better position to give you much more color on Mutant's and the activities that we have then behind it when we report our first quarter results in the first week of May. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : On the half of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, he's with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 4, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales were $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8%, as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings, as a result of the AFF transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter, as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7%, compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4%, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination expenses, as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter. Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we acquired from Coca-Cola, as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally, and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S., as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions. Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017, in parts of Minnesota including Minneapolis and St. Paul in March 2017, and in a part of North Dakota including Fargo in April 2017. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts. In EMEA in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017 we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East. In the first quarter of 2017 we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017 we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region. In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%, sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%, sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4%, and sales of AMP decreased 29.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-hour was down 7.2%, and AMP was down 29.9%. We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%. We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS's share increased 0.4 points to 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4%, and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago, and market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%, and market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull's sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%. Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly-wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico. According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the actual 13-week periods differ, varied by few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13% to 15.5% in Great Britain, from 9.5% to 10.6% in Belgium, from 9.1% to 11.6% in Norway, from 21.5% to 23.7% in France, from 24.4% to 26.5% in Spain, and from 13% to 16.3% in Germany. According to Nielsen, for the period ending March 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year decline from 6.8% to 5.2% in the Netherlands and from 11.1% to 10.8% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 22.1% in Sweden in the comparable period. For the 13-week period, ending March 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.3% to 11.6% in the Czech Republic, from 15.8% to 17.7% in South Africa and from 6.9% to 9.7% in Italy. For the 13-week period, ending February 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.3% to 9.9% in Ireland. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece grew in the 13 weeks ended February 2017 from 27.7% last year to 29.1%. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value in Chile increased to 28.4% in March 2017 as compared to 20.5% last year, and after transitioning to the KO bottler system in November 2016, Monster's market share and value in Brazil grew to 7.4% in March 2017 as compared to 2.9% in the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share and value increased from 17.9% to 24.5% in February 2017 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share and value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.9% to 44.2% in March 2017. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share and value grew from 3.1% to 7.1% in March 2017, and in New Zealand, Monster's market share and value grew from 2.3% to 5.5% for the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our re-torqued (18:03) products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream early in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars, and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars, and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.2% in the same period last year to 47.7% during the 2017 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 18.8% or 22.3% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 15% or 18.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7%, or 50% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico, the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 396.4% in dollars, or 481.7% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars, and 59.1% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 54.9 days, compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. As previously reported, in September 2016 we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers initially, followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 oz PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle Orange during the first quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017 we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July. We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches, such as Mango Loco, a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch, and a new espresso Monster Energy drink in 8 oz slim cans in two flavors planned for launch before year end. April 2017 had one fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy Drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. The equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, good afternoon, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Rodney, can you give us more detailed thoughts on your trends so far in the cities and where you've launched in China early on. And you've been, for a few months, any update on consumer demand in those markets? And then also, separately, some of the new cities launched more recently and what level is retailer reception you're getting? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that it really is still very early to tell. We're getting sales that we are comfortable with. It's all right, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically, pricing and points of sale. So, we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff \u2013 a brand like Monster which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are where you'd like it to be. There is a buildup and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really, it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and teammates to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution, and we are seeing good execution from a point of view of our point of sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that. But it really is just premature to talk. We are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We're right in the middle of the rollouts, as we've indicated. There were a whole new number of regions we introduced. It's probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We're planning launches. We've planned launches, and we have launched throughout April. And we continue in May, and then pretty much most of it will be done. So there will be a few more areas to do in June and July, but we think it'll be pretty much done by then. There may be one or two hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point. But it will take time, and it's just a very big market and you've got to be patient with and just build slowly. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think one of the other points about China is that a number of the websites and social media that our consumers are used to elsewhere in the world don't appear in China. So in a sense while we have extremely good exposure for the brand in many, many markets in the world, we don't have that same exposure to the Internet in China. So the build will be a lot harder. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I just wanted to follow up with more like thinking of all the outlets, if you can think about like how your growth was? I mean if you're putting the $12 million back, most likely your sales grew close to 7%? I wanted to just clarify that in the U.S. And if that is a number that we should use? And how is the cadence of the improvement during the quarter? I'm assuming, as most companies, like things have improved for the cadence of the quarter? And if you can tell us roughly how the sellout has been? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, let's just deal with the first question. One at a time. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: You've got to do your own numbers. We don't report the numbers for the U.S. and break them out. You've seen the Nielsen numbers. If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had and they've really been sort of more identified by \u2013 we try to keep the two main SKUs in production and on the shelf. But really what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off-the-shelf, and that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year, sort of the reserve for Red Bull. But again, we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing. So we really think that you guys have got make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth either to U.S. or on a broader basis, but we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth if you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referred to earlier. It was down to almost a negative inconvenience in December, and then it's grown just under 1% in January. It was 1.5% or so, roughly, in February. It was 2.5% or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly there is a nice trend, but you can see the numbers as well as we can. And we think that that is positive going forward. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But do you see it tracks well at this point? Nielsen is tracking well your actual volumes? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I'm not sure I heard the question. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No. I'm just saying if... Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: There's a difference between our sales and \u2013 the increase in our sales and what we are seeing in Nielsen. So we went through the Nielsen numbers on the call. You saw what our quarterly sales levels were, and then you must make your own assumptions as to what you think the performance was. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We obviously sell in a lot of the non-major channels and that really accounts for the difference and if you've noticed over the years there always has been some timing differences between Nielsen and our numbers. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thanks Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So maybe just to go back to that last question, something that clearly comes up repeatedly in conversations from investors in terms of trying to reconcile the scanner data with your reported results, maybe if you could give us a bit of specifics about change in points of distribution in the untracked channels, just so sort of where they come from, where are they now, and how large as a percent of the business \u2013 if you don't want to say specifically, but just sort of broader strokes about how important they're becoming to the business today versus where they've been. I think that might help folks a bit. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Without going into the level of them, we are starting to do more business and have more sales in the non-major channels, for example, food service, specialty accounts, non-food accounts. And those continue to increase. Internet, Amazon, although small, some of them are small, they are increasing at quite a strong rate. And we think that one of the reasons there is possibly some slowdown in the convenience channel is it may be attributable to the broader availability, not only of Monster but in fact of energy drinks, through a number of these non-traditional channels. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So, Mark, maybe I can give you a little bit more color. In the on-premise segment, we continue to see double-digit growth in this channel. So maybe that'll be helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Good afternoon. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, two questions. One on China. You talked about the buildup as we go through the next few months, or three months, and expect to be fully done by, latest, summer. When you say that, are you thinking about the ACV build or just the penetration? How are we thinking about it when we say fully implemented there? And then international again... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, let's just start \u2013 let's just do it one at a time, guys, please. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. When we say July, we will have launched through all of the business units in the \u2013 on the two Coke bottlers, there were three Coke bottlers and, as you are aware, the Coca-Cola owned bottler, they've sold their and refranchised their system. It's been divided effectively between COFCO and Swire. And then there was some interchange of territories between COFCO and Swire so that their own territories are more aligned and more adjacent to each other. So we will have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China, there is a modern trade, which is easier and obviously you pick up listings on that much more quickly. But the very, very bulk \u2013 large bulk of the business is still traditional trade. And that means it's got to be built up store-by-store slowly, slowly, one-by-one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up. And that is going to be a slow build. As we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system. So that's still going to take some time. There is a distinction between those two. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. That's really helpful. And then I just had a question on the international contribution margins, right? And you talked about gross margins increasing in many markets. How should we think about it? You're getting more and more contribution from international markets. At the operating level also are you seeing margins improve from these markets? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We are seeing some benefit. We are seeing benefits of scale and also improving our local production. We're continuing to get a number of additional plants online, which is helping us reduce our costs in many markets. And that will continue, because as we continue to build out the international market, we are continuing to go through this process of getting production lower and nearer to these markets. We do have \u2013 we'll have that same build in marketing and at G&A spend. But initially in some of the newer markets, we obviously are overspending in our G&A side, particularly payroll, in order to support the launches of brands. And so that will take some time, but as we continue, it will have less and less impact as we get maturer in these markets. But we still do have some large markets. I mean, going through the market in China at the moment, we're continuing to increase our head count quite substantially as we're go into each of these launches in each of these Bus, we have to have representation. When we go into India, we will need more people. So there is a disconnect but it is becoming less impactful, because of that we're seeing we think some better gross margins and better bottom-line margins as we go forward. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'd like to understand, I mean, to have a bit more clarification on two buckets of growth for you. So first is international launches. Could you give us an update on the three of the major country launches this year? So India, Pakistan, and Argentina. I understand Nigeria has been down. And the second bucket, of course, is Mutant in the U.S. So would like to understand, I mean, what are the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth, that seems to be soft for now So if you can give me, I mean, or give us, I mean, a bit on those two things and two buckets of growth that would be great. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. Just looking at those three markets, they're very large markets, but they're smaller markets from a point of view of the energy category, the premium energy category. So, in India, we are \u2013 as we've indicated planning to launch. We're also evaluating the possibility of launching Mutant as a sort of an affordable energy drink in that market. Argentina, we are moving forward. We are very close. We've still not finalized packing arrangements, but we're right in the middle of negotiations on that, and hope to be able to finalize that reasonably soon. We are, at the same time, going down the track of actually having our product registered and approved, so that's all happening, so that is again will also be a later launch later this year. With regard to Pakistan, we just \u2013 pretty much, I think we're about or we're in the throes of just starting to sell now, but it's a smaller market from a premium energy drink product brand. We think there is a much larger market that we can look at, and again, we're also looking at the possibility of launching Mutant there, also still later this year. So they're sort of slightly different. They're slightly different markets, and we are in the planning stages with them, and in the process, so they're all hopefully going to come through before the end of the year. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And on Mutant in the U.S., give us some color on to the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth that would be great. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, we have some planning activities. We have switched certain of our existing Monster properties, which we've had for many years and have done \u2013 worked very nicely for Monster, such as the Vans Warped Tour. We've made the Vans Warped Tour pretty much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S. We've also switched, not completely, but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam Series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We are going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant, and that's all starting to kick in now starting in May and June, the promotions and, as I've said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically our new zero-calorie White Lightning Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf, and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and zero, and that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those two things together we believe with a much broader rollout now. We've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels. We are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. So again, by the time we get to summer midyear, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you all may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please begin. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Sales continued to be challenging in the beverage industry in the second quarter and remained weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributor terminations. Excluding such accelerated recognition of deferred revenue from a comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S., which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales was 3% for the 2017 second quarter, as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase is primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1%, as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 second quarter were AFF transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million and modified Dutch auction tender offer expenses of $1.5 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations, AFF transaction expenses, and stock repurchase expenses, were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter, compared to 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs. Payroll expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to head count growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries as stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $1.3 million higher. Legal expenses relating to regulatory methods and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter, as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions. Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer, which was completed in June 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a part of North Dakota, including Florida in April 2017. So, we're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain additional countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean. In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in 14 new operating units. The two remaining operating units in China were launched during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are planning to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam and Taiwan in the third quarter. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $28.6 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared with $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were minimally realized in the comparable 2016 second quarter as the company's inventory on hand prior to the AFF transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF transaction which were recorded at fair value, were not fully recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the second quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2017 for all outlets combined, that will be convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 0.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 2.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 11.8% and sales for Full Throttle increased 1.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.7% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots, in dollars increased 1.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 6% over the same period last year while NOS was up 9.5% and Full Throttle sales increased 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 2%. Rockstar was down 2.6%. 5-Hour was down 11.3%, and AMP was down 23.4%. We point out that the energy shot category has been slow for some time and if we exclude the energy shots, as well as the energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the four-weeks ended July, 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars in fact increased by 4.3% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 10%. According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 36.7%. NOS' share increased 0.3 points to 4% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.1 point to 35.5%. Rockstar share was down 0.3 points to 7.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.2 points at 7.1% and AMP's share decreased 0.4 points to 1.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 11% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 21.2% lower than in the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 0.4% lower. We continued to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended June 24, 2017, the energy drink category remained flat in dollars. Monster sales increased 11% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 3.1 share points to 31.3%. Red Bull sales decreased 1% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 14% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 16.8%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 7.6% during the month of June 2017. Monster sales increased 22.6%. Our market share in value increased 3.3 points to 27.1%, against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 37.8%. Burn's market share decreased 2.1 points to 2.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 6.8% and its market share decreased by 1.7 points to 11.1%. Vive 100's market share decreased 0.7 points to 42.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.7 points to 8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2017 \u2013 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets \u2013 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 17.3% in Great Britain and from 22.3% to 23.1% in France. According to Nielsen, for the period-ending June 2017 \u2013 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets \u2013 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 14.7% in Germany, from 10.5% to 13.7% in Norway, from 24.9% to 26.5% in Spain, from 10.3% to 11.4% in Belgium, from 11.7% to 12.4% in Czech Republic, from 7.6% to 11.1% in Italy, from 7.9% to 10.3% in Ireland and from 13% to 16.2% in South Africa. According to Nielsen, in the latest 13-week period ended June 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year declined from 10.7% to 9.6% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 18.1% in the same comparative period, and declined from 7.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, which is being addressed. According to IRI, Monster has increased its market share from 27.4% to 34.5% in Greece in the 13 weeks ended June 2017. According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 21% to 29.8% compared to the same period last year, and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of June 2017 increased from 2.5% to 11.5% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 18.6% to 28.9% in May 2017 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 43.8% in June 2017. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 3.4% to 7.8% in June 2017 as compared to the same period last year. And according to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended June 11, 2017, grew from 4.2% to 6.7% as compared to the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2017 increased 9.7% from $743.5 million to $815.3 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $8.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $85.6 million for the second quarter as compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, was $6.2 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter last year. We continued to experience production capacity shortages for our retooled products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a few months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales were negatively impacted as a result of such production capacity shortages by approximately $13 million in the second quarter and year-to-date by approximately $25 million. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $247.9 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to $200.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately $8.2 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 18.6% in dollars, and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8% in the same period last year, to 49% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we have added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA, with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic and South Africa. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 64.6% in dollars, and 66.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.1% in the same period last year to 50.7% during the 2017 second quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 53% or 55% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continued to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 84.7% or 78.7% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales decreased 3.1%, or minus 4.3% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to re-entering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the second quarter increased 28.6% in dollars and 28.8% in local currencies. Net sales in the second quarter increased 25% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50% in the same period last year to 46.7% during the 2017 second quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 849.6% in dollars, or 728.8% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 35.4% in dollars and 33.4% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $777.7 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $323.9 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $48.6 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $537.1 million at June 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 47 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $190.6 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 53 days at June 30, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched our Monster Hydro energy drinks during the quarter in three flavors. Monster Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter after limited sales with a club store customer the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and we'll launch to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550 mL PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which was followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July. We have a robust innovation pipeline including a new espresso Monster Energy drink in eight-ounce slim cans in two flavors and Nitrous Mango planned for launch before the year-end in the United States. We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S., Nielsen and market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year, as well as in July. Equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continued to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches. Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top ten beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis. Eight, we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets in the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Afternoon. Hi, Bill. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hey Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 we've been hearing as the transition of Coke in the U.S. goes from Coke corporate to the bottlers, there have been some benefit in terms of sales. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing any kind of change in where they go to market with your products? And is that a net benefit? I remember I guess a year ago there was \u2013 as you had the transition from ABI to Coke, it was a actually a slowdown, but I didn't know if you were seeing some net benefit as you move to market this year. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We think that it is \u2013 there's not a general rule across the board. In certain markets, the transition has been less noticeable. In some markets, it has taken some of the newer bottlers, has taken them some time to get up to speed and we are seeing some sort of disruption in delivery schedules and et cetera. But overall, we are seeing improvements and benefits. So we are positive about the transition. It's a question of just, there is some sort of noise during the transitional periods as they've had to get up to speed. I think Hilton's got some... Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think the only thing I wanted to make was that anecdotally, as we looked at the independent bottlers over the years, their performance relative to the company bottlers has actually been better. So I think we're looking for better performance from these bottlers as refranchising takes place. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. I agree. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC: And thank you for the question. So my one question just has to do with the supply constraints on coffee that you're going to remedy by exporting out of Europe. Can you please give us a sense of the potential implications to your gross margin as you work through those supply issues? Thank you. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: We had a price increase in Java Monster effective January 1. And what we have seen is that the increase in finding the price increase has actually been kind of equivalent to the increased costs that we're sustaining by bringing product from Europe. So it's basically been a wash. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. And I think that as we continue to secure increased production in the U.S., which is what we're now doing, those costs will come down. So really, it's been a temporary increase just to the extent that we have been importing, obviously, to supplement our products, yeah, we're still at all times have been getting the vast majority of our production in the U.S. And so, we obviously do have a shipping charge, but as Hilton has indicated, that's been negated by the increase, and going forward, we think that will become less relevant and we will increase those margins again. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Mark, what happened to you? Operator : Pardon me, Mark. Your phone is on mute. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Perhaps we can come back to Mark. Operator : We'll move to the next person. Our next person is from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital. Your line is open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: At least you're there, Amit. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, a quick question on the trends in the CMD (32:19) channel, definite acceleration versus where we were last quarter. Can you talk about that; what's happening? In the past you've talked about innovation, maybe a reason for the category slowdown. Are we getting past that hump at this point? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We still haven't got a really accurate handle on the reason for the slowdown in convenience. We've all been puzzled in the beverage industry, generally. There are a number of speculative reasons that have come out over the period of time. We were talking to the Coke bottlers, and everybody's got theories. But it has been a slowdown which has been sort of unusual for us in these times. It is starting to pick up. We are seeing some positive signs, both in the CMD (33:13) category and sector and generally. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think one of the other things is that our convenience store customers have also been concerned about foot traffic. And while no one could put their hands on it, there's lots of speculation, as Rodney said. One of the points that was raised by the bottlers at the recent meeting that we attended was that the SNAP program and the reduction in benefits under the SNAP program could have an impact on lower convenience store traffic. So I just put that out as an additional possibility. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I agree. And then the other one that has been, again, more anecdotal is the Trump effect just on Hispanic foot traffic into the convenience stores seems to have also dropped off a little bit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy. Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Rodney, I had one clarification on Java and then a Hydro question. So on Java, when you said getting to the normal supply is going to take a few months. Are you commenting that maybe in third quarter we still see a drag of something like a $10 million to $15 million that we saw in the first and the second quarter, or basically that drag dissipates as you're kind of lapping the decline that you started to see last year? And then on Hydro, can you just update us on maybe what you're seeing from a distribution ramp perspective? Because if you look at the ACV, I think it's still below 40%, even though it's come up pretty nicely, and that's still below the number that you're seeing for the Green and the Ultra. Do you think that you can get to that level pretty quickly from a Hydro perspective? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Just going back to the coffee question. We think that there still will be a drag from July, but we're seeing every month, we are seeing improved deliveries, and we think that we will be fully up to speed towards the end of the quarter. So we think that there will be \u2013 still be some drag, some reduction, shortages going forward, but we think it will be reduced, but to the extent we're not sure. And obviously, we're right in the phase now of getting production, and that means getting back our shelf space and that will take a bit of time. With regard to Hydro, your point is noted, and that is correct that the ACV at the moment is at about 40%. So we've obviously still got some work to do to get Hydro out and get it \u2013 again, it was sort of launched a little bit off cycle. And so we are getting it into the chains and into the stores, but it is taking some time. But again, there are all sort of supplier constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously is of concern to us, but unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues, and literally, we're selling all we can supply. So we will continue to, I think, improve the supply situation and as that goes, so we will continue to supply \u2013 to increase and improve our distribution. But that's really a positive side of the brand, that it is pulling and it has received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't have the same supply constraints, a slightly larger-sized bottle. And we believe we'll be able to launch that and get that on the shelves at the same time as the can. And that will supplement we believe the can and consumer demand. The consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar-sized bottle. This will be a larger bottle where at the moment we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750 mL size, resealable. So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle. So there will be a choice of additional flavors and hopefully we'll be able to get to that and solidify our shelf space and therefore satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be a supply of Hydro on the shelves, even though there may at times be some shortages in the can size, until we get those supply issues rectified. Operator : Thank you. Now we have a question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Let's try that again. Can you hear me? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes, this time we can. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Hilton muted my line. That was the problem. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. We thought we got off lightly this quarter. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I was curious if you could comment on the number of SKUs you're selling in international markets, just sort of broadly. I mean I know there are more in EMEA versus some other markets. But you see, call it 10, 15 SKUs in a typical shelf placement in the U.S. Where are you in other international markets? And sort of how do you think about that as an opportunity longer term? And how do you ultimately get incremental shelf space? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, if you look at mass markets, it really is very varied. It depends on the maturity of the market. As you say, you've got most of the European markets with a lot more SKUs, but even within the European markets there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the UK and Germany and Spain versus other markets. And it varies pretty dramatically. You also have a lot of the, what I call the sub lines, the strategic lines that we've got, the families that haven't yet even been launched. We've launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little Rehab in Europe. And we've just sort of going up with Punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly not everywhere but in a number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa. We think there is a good potential for the brand. So out of that you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential. Even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there, there still is a pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential. But if you looked at it sort of on average, I would say you're looking at probably 30% to 40% of the SKUs on average in overseas markets versus the U.S., just as a very, very broad thumb suck (40:55) across a number of \u2013 but that's not on a weighted or on any sort of statistical analysis. That's just pretty much anecdotally our gut feel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : First question is on the U.S. market. So strong July growth sales update, 14.7%, FX neutral. Doesn't look like there's any adjustment needed for trading days, so that's great. Hilton, do you have the breakdown between U.S. and international? I guess as we're looking at the Nielsen data, the most recent data that we got for the last couple of weeks in July was up 8%, and you had spoken to some of the acceleration you're seeing. Is that sort of representative of the acceleration you're seeing? That's question number one. And then, Rodney, for you, question number two. With respect to Java and Muscle Monster, as that supply comes back on, how are you ensuring that's all incremental? You called out the $13 million and $25 million year-to-date drag for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, if I'm not mistaken, so that's a couple points to U.S. sales growth. So any comments there with respect to how incremental that could potentially be for the U.S. would be helpful. Thank you for both of those. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. So as we look at our increase in July, and we always give a lot of caveats because it's very early in the month, that 14.7% that we spoke about that was internationally, that wasn't in the U.S. So I'm not sure, your reference to that being in the U.S., that's a group consolidated number. Also, we don't traditionally break down our increase in gross sales by market area, and I don't think we want to start that because I don't think we've done that in the past. So I'm not going to give that number, but the 14.7% is a consolidated number. As we said, it's 13.8% and 14.7% on a foreign exchange adjusted basis. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: All we can really say is that if you look at the Nielsen numbers, as you said, you are seeing that increase. We're seeing it as well. So we seem to be ahead of the Nielsen, generally, continuing to get share both internationally and in the U.S. So there's nothing that's inconsistent with our previous growth in the quarter that we're seeing in the month of July. It just is doing better generally across the board. With regard to Java and Muscle Monster, where we sat incremental, I mean, we've lost shelf space, but even if you look at Java, I was looking at the numbers on all major channels. Even for our two main Java products which we've basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71%, whereas in our other top brands we're in the high 80%s and low 90%s. So they've clearly lost some distribution even for the two main SKUs. The others, if we look at salted caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that's at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We've just got to get supplies back and that is one of the reasons that we hesitated a bit earlier. Because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we have those supplies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get back shelf space because we obviously don't want another hiccup with retailers. So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, (44:50) and salted caramel and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loca Moca. So we look at that as being, positive and it is going to start basically taking place during this quarter. But it's going to be on an increased rolling basis and we think that by the fourth quarter, we will very much be back into where we were and we look at the coffee category growing pretty well. And that's been slowed down, I think even with the issues we've had and with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth. With regard to Muscle Monster, it's the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking and evaluating and going to relaunch and reposition the Muscle Monster in an aseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going move into a plastic bottle, we think hopefully still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling and hopefully that's going to be a position to start in the next few months. And so that transition we think will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are positive about that sector, which we think we are under-represented in at the moment. So that's another source of, we think, some potential upside. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, just to be clear, we utilized the production capacity that was available to us with Java Monster for our top-selling SKUs. So we decided we were not going to bring those SKUs from Europe because we didn't want to disturb the flavor profile. We wanted to maintain the flavor profile. So those two products, the main two products in the Java Monster line, we kept with production here. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy Brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 8, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, net sales were $909.5 million, up 15.4% from $788 million in the third quarter of 2016. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 14.1% from $913.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix as well as the increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively. General and administrative expenses excluding distributor terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales for the comparable 2016 third quarter. Payroll expenses were up $6.5 million, primarily due to head count growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation and non-cash item was $1.1 million higher. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter, primarily due to profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter of 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Georgia and Kuwait in the third quarter of 2017, and in Ghana and Morocco in October 2017. Additional launches are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nicaragua, and in October, we transitioned Monster Energy in the Bahamas, Grenada and Jamaica, the latter not to a Coca-Cola bottler. We also are planning to launch in and or transition to additional countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2018. In China, during the third quarter of 2017, we launched the final two operating units and are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster in the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Vietnam and have begun distribution in Taiwan. We are also planning to re-launch Monster in India. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 6.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.3% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%, sales of Rockstar increased by 0.2%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.4% and sales of Amp decreased 32.2%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 3.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.8% and Full Throttle sales decreased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.1%, Rockstar was up 1%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 39.4%. We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. If we exclude energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars in fact increased by 5.8% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 11%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 37.2%, NOS's share increased 0.1 points to 4.1% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 points to 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.5 points to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.2 points to 7.8%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.7 points at 6.9%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.6 points to 0.9%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 12.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 4.8% lower. We have worked through our production capacity shortages for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We've secured additional production of Java Monster and Muscle Monster in the United States which came online in the third quarter of 2017. Those products came off allocation at the end of the quarter. Such production to give (10:27) additional production available to us in Europe, has eliminated our shortages for Java Monster and Muscle Monster. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended August 19, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 5% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.8 share points to 32.1%, Red Bull sales remained the same, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 37.8%. Rockstar sales remained the same and its market share increased by 0.3 point to 15.9%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 6% during the month of September 2017. Monster sales increased 34.8%. Our market share in value increased 6.1 points to 28.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 46.4%, Burn's market share decreased 2.4 points to 2.5%, Red Bull sales decreased 1.6% and its market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.8%. Vive 100 market share decreased 4 points to 40.2% while Boost market share decreased 0.5 point to 8.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain, by one or more energy drink brands, during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen's statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 14.3% to 18.5% in Great Britain, from 8.7% to 13.2% in Italy, and in France from 22.7% to 24%. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased from 10.4% to 10.1% in Sweden, although the retail sales value in sales grew 25.7% in the same comparative period.

According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending August 2017, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 9.1% to 13.3%. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 21.7% to 30.8%, compared to the same period last year and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of September 2017, increased from 2.5% to 13.7% as compared to the same period last year.

According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended September 3, 2017, grew from 4% to 6.2% as compared to the same period last year.

Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2017 increased 16.6% from $710.1 million to $827.7 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $0.4 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $76.6 million for the third quarter as compared to $72.1 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.2 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $5.7 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $260.1 million, in the 2017 third quarter compared to $190.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $0.7 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the third quarter increased 42.5% in dollars and 40.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.5% in the same period last year to 50.9% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and South Africa. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 22% in dollars and 26.6% in local currencies over the same period last year.

In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 27.9% or 36.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continued to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 16.7%, or 16.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 2.5% or minus 5.1% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards re-entering that market.

Net sales in the third quarter increased 34.3% in dollars and 31.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales remained the same at 47.6% during the 2017 third quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 497.2% in dollars or 482.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 160.8% in dollars and 159.1% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $465.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $630.3 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $7 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $535.3 million at September 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.7 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $213.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 56.5 days at September 30, 2017 compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to the general market in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with the convenience store customer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria. We are in the process of launching Espresso Monster in two flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro, which was launched in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017, have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets including South Africa. We are planning to launch the Lewis Hamilton drinks in Australia in early 2018. We remain confident about the potential for this product. We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We note that in October 2017 there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million, excluding broker commissions. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $27.7 million in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017 reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.3% market share and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets, and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets this year, and anticipate further transitions and launches. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Question please? Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, I guess, I wanted to just start off with the gross margin question. Rodney, you called out a few factors that negatively impacted the quarter. I just wanted to get a little bit better sense of some of the callouts, specifically product mix, and then I think you said other costs. So hoping you can elaborate a little bit more? And then how much of those are really more transitory and one-time if it's something about getting the Java back online. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, Judy, we've always said that the international margins are lower than domestic margins. So the quarter was more pronounced because there was a larger growth in sales internationally. So that accounted for a significant portion of the reduction in overall gross margin. We had some other issues relating to input costs, some cost increases \u2013 I shouldn't say issues \u2013 cost increases in relation to input costs. And there was some impact as well of product mix where we have different products that we sell that have different \u2013 every SKU has a different margin. So on balance, this quarter there was \u2013 and with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items. So those are the three major factors that contributed to the reduction in gross margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Question please? William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Just to follow up on the U.S. markets. I understand the issues with Java Monster and what have you, but the overall energy drink category has kind of had the whole year low at low-single digits. Are you seeing from the competition, Red Bull in particular, just lack of innovation? Are you seeing an overall slowdown? And are you just gaining share? Or \u2013 and maybe with that, what are you seeing out of the c-store channel? We had heard earlier in the year that that had slowed down, but it seems to maybe be picking back up. So kind of any comments on kind of the state of the U.S. energy market overall, not just you gaining share and getting products back? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that as we have said on previously calls, there had been a slowing of the convenience category, which traditionally had grown at a higher rate than the other categories, and we were sort of \u2013 everybody was sort of scratching their heads a little to try and find out why. And we didn't really \u2013 weren't able to really put our finger on it. We are seeing a pickup back in the convenience category sales, and they do seem to be starting to turn around and come back, as I indicated earlier on, on the numbers. So we are positive about the category and about the convenience traffic as well. That does seem to be doing better. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Question please? Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I know you guys aren't in the habit of offering guidance, but given the volatility that we've seen around Java Monster, which has historically been such a good growth driver, can you give us a sense of how we should think about distribution coming back online? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. I'm not sure we can give you very much a guidance. Obviously the energy and coffee category has continued to grow through our difficulties. We, obviously, lost sales and we lost some market share. And as we indicated at the end of the quarter, everybody is \u2013 we are back with products in inventory, we're shipping orders in full to our bottlers, and they are now \u2013 and we are together now getting product back on the shelf. So we've got to, obviously, fight back and get back the shelf space that contracted during that period, but we are \u2013 we're quite encouraged that we'll get back shelf space quite quickly. We are positive for the coffee category, and that is why we're right in the throes literally this week of starting to sell and launch Espresso Monster, and we will be coming \u2013 launching, early in the new year, we'll be launching Caf\u00e9 Monster in glass bottles. So we think there is good growth potential for the coffee category and the coffee plus energy category. We still think those are good \u2013 it's a good growth category beverages, generally and for us. And with getting back into our inventory position and eliminating our shortages, we think that from the fourth quarter we will start to see the benefits come through. So we are positive about it. But to what extent and how quickly, obviously, we're not going to give guidance on that because it is uncertain anyway to us even at this time. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. All we can say is that our bottler partners are committed to getting the shelf space back and committed to the product. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Question please. Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on Hydro, how it's doing in the marketplace, and whether you've gotten by the supply issues at this point, and maybe perhaps compare Hydro's reception in the market with Mutant. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think they're two very different products. Let's just focus on Hydro for the moment. Hydro we've had a really good response, both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have risen rather (31:08) well, which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory. We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or give the full story because we're out of stock a lot of the time. If you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the results have actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales purported to (31: 35) in the Nielsen, and that is consistent with our feedback from the market and the field and from retailers. So we are very positive about that. The way we've \u2013 addressing that is we will be launching a line of four SKUs; one \u2013 we're probably going to take one of the existing three SKUs and convert that into a 750-ml bottle, and we're going to have three other 750-ml PET bottles, one of which will be a zero calorie, zero-sugar product. So with those four products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can, because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is, I think important for the brand. So, ultimately, once we get that rectified, we'll obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. So going out probably early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750-ml, a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply, because you'll have one or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Question please. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, gentlemen \u2013 and ladies and gentlemen there. Just on the \u2013 if you can comment a little bit on China and what are the impressions now that you've probably reached where you wanted to be. And I know you can't compare with last year, but if you can tell us how it's tracking against plan. And if you \u2013 I think building with the last question, if you can talk a little bit about Mutant. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: China is a great opportunity for us. It's a logistically very, very big and complex country, and we are continuing to make progress. We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We had some challenges in basically securing space for us. Basically there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on the energy category and say you've got an energy product. They just put your new product in the energy category. And so there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where their focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing an adequate job is to \u2013 if they're struggling to find a position for the product, they find a position in the Coke cooler and your product goes into the Coke cooler. Now that seems to sound fine, but ultimately, if the other products like the Red Bull Gold, which is the leader in the category and are being sold in an independent cold door, even on the warm shelf, the consumer is not expecting to go into the Coke cooler and find an energy drink. And we're really going through a learning curve with our bottlers to try and explain to them that the first prize is not actually being in the Coke cooler. The first prize is actually being \u2013 and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution which is obviously always positive, then you're going to the Coke cooler with that secondary distribution point. So that is just an educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the one hand, you've got this really big sales force available to us, which is a very big positive. On the other hand, they're used to selling and putting their product into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler where they have many of them. We're really having to refine that and tweak that slightly, and that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive, and we believe that it's going to continue to grow. Our sales are going to continue to grow, and it is a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down as we continue to progress. So that is really all we can say on China is the sales are good. They're substantial. If you look at our other markets and comparable other markets that we've launched at, the sales are higher, but we are working through these operational challenges and we'll get through them. There's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them and having the time to train everybody and understand what the priorities are. So that's really an update on China. Unknown Speaker : And I always \u2013 when I look at China, I always look at what happened in other countries where we launched, and generally we sustained losses in those countries in the earlier years. You can look at Europe and track through the various Qs and Ks, and China I don't believe will be any different. So we will sustain a loss in China this year and it's something we were prepared for and is not a shock to us. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: So we still remain ultimately at the end of the day positive that that's going to be a large contributor to the company and to the brand going forward in future years. With regard to Mutant, we're still putting our heads down. We are sort of looking at expanding our distribution and our channels. We believe that the brand has got a good potential. We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers' support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant. And we see that as a long-term potential benefit and good opportunity for the company. But it is, again, if we're looking at an analysis, you look at the brands in the soft drink industry and the average age of the brands of old \u2013 decades old that we're going up against. We're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands, and we are going to continue to \u2013 we will continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand. We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really \u2013 really looks good on the product. It does transform the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts we're testing this larger cap formatting, we will determine whether we actually transition all the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml or 26 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. So that's the one thing we are looking at in the Mutant line, and we think this is so far out from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A portion. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the strategic brands as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.",

Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please begin. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27-A of the Securities Act of 1953 as amended, and Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1954 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements with as results of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information, attached to the earnings release dated February 28, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter. The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the current estimate which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter. As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter together with the reduction in Java Monster sales had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans, as well as logistical costs from imports. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicative storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million square foot warehouse and distribution center in Southern California. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, mainly for NOS, increased costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions, and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs excluding distributor terminations were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. And stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $0.9 million higher. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety, and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reason, as well as inventory reserves. Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. Under the Tax Reform Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts and e-commerce. In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in parts of Minnesota and Arkansas. And with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in Armenia, Belarus, and Tanzania. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in the Bahamas and Grenada, as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler. We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018. In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan. We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a limited territory, and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier. We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., where Mutant is positioned as a Super Soda, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam in 2018. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 7.3%, and sales of Amp decreased 22.4%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 4.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 13.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull were flat, Rockstar was down 2.4%, 5-Hour was down 8.4%, and Amp was down 15.5%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3.2 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share increased by 0.1 points to 4.3% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.4 points to 34.1%, Rockstar's share was down 0.5 points to 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.6% and Amp's share decreased 0.3 points to 1.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 8.8% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 8% lower. The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter. Together with our bottling partners we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the energy drink category increased 8% in dollars. Monster sales increased 14% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.7 share points to 32.4%. NOS's sales increased 65% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 3.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 45% and its market share increased 0.4 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35.8%. Rockstar's sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.7 of a point to 18%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 3.3% during the month of January 2018. Monster sales increased 21.5%. Our market share in value increased 4.8 points to 31.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 39.7%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 7.4% and its market share decreased by 1.4 points to 11.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 4.6 points to 31.9% while Boost's market share decreased 1.1 points to 11.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year, grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 27.4% to 28.6% in Spain, and in France, from 22.5% to 25.5%. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium. From 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden. From 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway, and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy. For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.9% in South Africa, although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period. And from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended December 24, 2017 grew from 5.3% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 22.7% to 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.6% to 44.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. We will again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6% from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drinks segment in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the strategic brand segment were $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's strategic brand segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs, as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reductions resulted in substantially higher sales to that distribution partner in January 2018 as compared to January 2017. It is significant to note that sales out by our distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Spain. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2%, or 10% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter. As with a number of our other overseas distributors, sales by our distributor to the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remained strong and in line with earlier periods. In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam, net sales increased 25.2%, or 23.2% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market, initially in a limited territory. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru. In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster, as well as in advance of their launches, Caff\u00e9 Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. Monster Energy continues to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresso Monster in two flavors and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S. at the end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caff\u00e9 Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in three flavors, and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in two flavors. In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our two Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster MAX line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing one of our two existing SKUs in this line and adding two new flavors. We are also launching Rehab White Dragon Tea. Finally capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we are expanding Monster Hydro into a re-sealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding three new flavors. In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultraviolet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultraviolet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in three flavors, as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans. We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018. We are launching Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017. In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to A, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and B, initial shipments of Caff\u00e9 Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles which were launched in January 2018. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores. Distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for a full quarter or any future periods. On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million excluding broker commissions, leaving a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. On February 27, 2018, the Board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars, and at 42.9% market share including the strategic brands. And that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 38.2% market share. Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India, despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year, and anticipate further transitions and launches this year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon. Hi, Bill. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Bill. How are you? William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Just on the gross margin side, is the three factors that impacted the fourth quarter, China reserves, raw materials having higher material costs, and then the mix, would you expect kind of all of those to have a similar impact as we move into 2018 or any of them being mitigated? How should I look at especially on the higher material costs and how should I look at that in 2018? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, the higher material costs we expect to continue, particularly for aluminum. I think, you've seen in the announcements that are in play regarding aluminum and aluminum costs, so we expect an increase in aluminum. Sweetener, we'll continue to experience costs in sweeteners this year, so the only factor that will possibly diminish is inventory reserves in China. Those we don't expect to continue. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I guess I wanted to ask about these inventory reserves. So what exactly is going on in China, I guess most specifically, but also why you're doing that in India? And then just sort of more broadly, I guess I get the moving parts on what you talked about from inventory reductions by bottlers outside of the U.S. but I guess if you look at it within the U.S. as well, the numbers were still on a reported basis lower than what the end demand or scanner data would have indicated. So I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Is that catch-up? Did you over ship in prior quarters and sort of how did you think about that from an inventory standpoint now going forward? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think, the issue in China was the demand was misjudged in summer and we ended up with excess inventory which we've needed to work through and we've made provisions for that. In India, we've also been running some test runs and trials, and we've been having some challenges in some of the testing of ingredient levels. They use a different testing set of tests for what we do and we use around the world, and we've been having a number of debates about what the testing levels are because we were comfortable with the ingredient levels that we put in, but yet they were coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results a little differently. But yet, that is the method that is used in India, and that has caused us some hiccups and delays in getting going because we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock write-offs. With regard to the scanner data in the U.S., I think there's been an increase in the scanner data more recently. I think the numbers are coming up. And I think that's just indicative of where the market has been, but it has improved from the latter part of last year. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: We've never said that there's a perfect science between our sales to our distributors and the sales at retail. But over a period of time, one does see the correlation. And then one other thing I wanted to add on India is there are some new can regulations, labeling regulations that are being put in place, which was another reason for certain reserves in India. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Right. I agree. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon there. I just want to clarify. You obviously said that the impact of the extra inventory could be about less than 50%, so I'm trying to do the math. Would you say it's like in the mid-teens growth and then you had an extra selling day in January 2018? So what should we be thinking on a normalized basis like you will run through or run rate on the top line product to date? And then the other question is regarding your gross margin. I understand all the puts and takes. But in your view, you're still going to see pressure from these items into 20 \u2013 bigger pressure into 2018 on the gross margin, but it's mostly on a mix effect and on aluminum. But if you can help us guide us through the impacts, that would be great. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So on the gross margin, we don't give guidance, and it's something that the company has never done. We give the information as we have it, as we see it through the quarter. But if you wanted a kind of gross margin, a conservative gross margin looking forward, I personally, and this is a personal feeling, I would just use the gross margin for the quarter. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: That's helpful, thank you. And on the top line, I'm just trying to see it from the extra day, and obviously you said less than 50% impact. So I'm trying to reconcile the 25% or 27% FX-neutral on a quarter-to-date. Is that something we should be thinking on the mid-teens normalized days, or a bit less because of the extra day? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We actually described it as less than half. And the reason we did that was that what we don't know is \u2013 while there was, we believe, additional purchases by these distribution, by the distributors, we're not sure all of those additional purchases took place in January because we haven't done the analysis of specific SKUs and the purchases. And so we believe that it was less than 50%, but that is our best estimate on those numbers at this time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes, good evening, Rodney and Hilton. On the international business, how should we think about the right level of growth in the international segment? So 5% organic growth in the quarter seems extremely low. Would a yearly growth level at 25% be right, and the 30%-plus we saw in the first three quarters to be inflated by gradual increase of inventory? So I'm trying to figure out what is the right level of inventory in international to figure out the right growth level in that segment. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Again, we described on this call what had happened with regard to inventory reductions. We also spoke about some issues with regard to China. We don't give guidance, but I think there's sufficient information for you to look at historical information and honestly make up your own estimates because we don't give guidance. It's really difficult to sit here and answer these questions where you guys are looking for guidance. We don't give guidance. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And I think we did mention that. And that's why we actually have given a lot of the Nielsen information and sales out because that is less affected by purchases of inventory and timing and production timings. And so if you look at EMEA, which is probably our largest international market, we've given you, it's close to, Nielsen's are up in EMEA close to mid-20s. And we've given you Nielsen's for the other areas as well. So those were the numbers that are showing where we expect the numbers to continue. And so when we look at the demand in ongoing sales levels for internationally, they're pretty much in line with the Nielsen numbers and the numbers that have been reported by us in previous quarters. It's clearly a choppy quarter. But that's why we think that the sales out numbers, depletions from our distributors and the best number of all is, obviously, the sales into the markets, which are measured generally reasonably reliably measured by Nielsen are the numbers that you guys should be looking to going forward. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: And that's why we give these numbers. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open. Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks, hi there. This is on distribution and selling expenses up as a percent of sales. Could you just explain to us in an environment where there's a shortage of truckers and distribution costs are going up, how it works for you guys? Are you all third party? Are your contracts longer term? And then on the selling side, how much of that big percentage increase versus sales was relating to the China India markets? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: So on distribution costs, we relocated our warehousing to our new warehouse in California during the quarter, and that impacted distribution costs. Regarding trucking, we have our own fleet that we operate mainly for local markets, but we depend extensively on third-party trucking. And then, Caroline, your other question was how much of the distribution costs were related to China and India, and I don't have that to hand, I'm sorry. In India, obviously it wasn't much because we're still in production trials. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good evening. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Two quick points of clarification just because the quarter was a little bit noisy with the distributor issues. So one, just to be very clear. It seems like it was just sort of a one-month issue that not only do you not expect it to persist, but it already seems like its begun to reverse out in the month of January. So if you could just clarify on that? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Right. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : And then point number \u2013 okay. Perfect. And then question number two, it doesn't seem like there's anything quantitatively that changes your view on the outlook for your international business. The POS data, the Nielsen data sounds very, very strong. So if you could just confirm that and include it in that response, could you also include China and whether you have a change in view there and what the company's outlook, and what it's capable of achieving in that market? Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that generally international is in line with Nielsen and what we've already indicated. We are comfortable with that and we think that basically our sales momentum remains intact for the brand. In the China market, that has been a challenging market, and it's been costly and we've incurred \u2013 obviously incurred losses. We knew we would do so, and your question is hard, and not dissimilar to any other companies who have entered the Chinese market. We are continuing to persist with it. We've obviously \u2013 we have the resources, we've put resources behind the brand. We've put marketing and promotion behind the brand. And those are continuing to obviously impact our bottom line. But we see those as long-term opportunities, and we've got to look to establishing the brand in the long-term in China. That's our objective and we are confident we'll get there, but we just got to have \u2013 it's going to take time to do so. And again, India we are \u2013 we don't believe India in the shorter term is as big a market or potential as China, but it also has just been again some ups and downs in getting going. We are confident that we will get going, but it has \u2013 we've set up with staff, we've set up with operations there, and that clearly has affected our bottom line. Those amounts will start eventually to improve as we continue to increase our sales and are able to manage our expenses in those countries more efficiently going forward. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. I'd just like to add that the group that has worked with this company for a number of years will remember that it took a number of years for us to become profitable in Europe and in EMEA generally, and there are a lot of lessons that are being learned in China every day. We've got some of our own executive staff over there, on secondment, and our bottling partners are just very much on board and we haven't heard anything negative about the long-term potential for the brand from our partners. Operator : Thank you and this concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brand and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the strategic brands and Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day, everyone.",

Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently-available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method, or consolidates are now included as a reduction to net sales whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses. In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6% as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to : increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix, our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a change in domestic product sales mix principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain import costs principally freight-in aluminum cans and sucralose; Hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA, and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3% as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs was distributed termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally including to support the launches in China and other countries. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons as well as due to inventory reserves. Our effective tax rates decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction. Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributed terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after-tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels including foodservice, accounts and e-commerce. In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we have now fully transitioned the state of Minnesota. In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets. During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution and sales of Monster in India more extensively later this year. Mutant, one of our affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 31, 2018, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Energy Shots increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 13.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 6.1% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.2%, sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 2.6%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.6%, and sales of Amp decreased 19.6%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars increased 5.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 14.7% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle was up 0.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2.6%, Rockstar was down 5.6%, 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 21.8%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 3 points over the same period last year to 37.8%. NOS's share remained the same at 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1 point to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.8 of a point to 7.1%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.7%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.3 of 1 point to 0.9%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, which now includes Caff\u00e9 Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 19.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 26.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 6.2% lower. Our shares of coffee + energy category which we define as including Java Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 was 56.6%, up 11.7 points. Java Monster's share alone for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 was 47.6%, up 2.6 points, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy's share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points. The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came up for allocation by the end of that quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the Energy Drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%. NOS's sales increased 8% and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.9%. Full Throttle's sales increased 22% and its market share increased by 0.2 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.5%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 17.6%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% during the month of March 2018. Monster sales increased 20.7%. Our market share in value increased 0.7 points to 29% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 13.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 points to 2%. Red Bull sales increased 5.9% and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 11.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.7% and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities put a very significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 10.5% to 11.5% in Belgium, from 11.8% to 12% in Czech Republic, from 23.7% to 27.1% in France, from 15.6% to 18.7% in Great Britain, from 31.2% to 31.8% in Greece, from 10% to 14.1% in Italy, from 5.2% to 7% in the Netherlands, from 11.6% to 16.2% in Norway, from 6.5% to 8.3% in Poland, from 26.4% to 29.1% in Spain, and from 10.6% to 11.8% in Sweden. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending February 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 10.3% to 13.7% in Ireland. For the 13-week period ended March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 16% in Germany, and from 16.8% to 15.3% in South Africa, although sales were up in both countries. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 28.4% to 34.4% compared to the same period last year, and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of March 2018 increased from 7.4% to 14.9% as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 7.1% to 9.1% in March 2018, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended March 18, 2018 grew from 5.7% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 25.1% to 30.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 45.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2018 increased 16.7% from $668.6 million to $780.5 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 17.3%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $15.4 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment was $65.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $68 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment for the first quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brand segment would have been 5.6%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $2.3 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the first quarter, as compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $242.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $190.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $17.7 million. (00:20:15) reported geographic sales or our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 30.5% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies, as the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 37.2% in net sales and 23.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales for the quarter, was 44.5%, compared to 50.3% in the same quarter last year and 47.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2% for the first quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. We're pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in the Netherlands and Ultra Violet in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 21.3% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.8% versus 47.7% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44%. The decrease in gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 54.6% or 49.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In South Korea, net sales increased 22.9%, or 13.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 5.5% or 1% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the first quarter increased 37.7% in dollars and 34.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 39.4% in dollars and 36.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.5% versus 48.8% over the same period last year and 47.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2%. Net sales increased in Brazil by 86.1% in dollars and 88.2% in local currency largely due to the continued performance of Monster Energy drinks. Net sales in Chile increased 27.9% in dollars and 20% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $511.4 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $585.2 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $33.5 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased to $525.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.1 days compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $268.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 71.7 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caff\u00e9 Monster, a ready to drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in three flavors, relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in two flavors and launched Rehab White Dragon Tea. We rebranded our two Monster Extra Strength SKUs into the Monster MAXX line and added an additional SKU. We also expanded Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle with three new flavors. In Canada in the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet and Monster Hydro in a 550-mL PET bottle in three flavors as well as Full Throttle orange in 16-ounce cans. In EMEA we launched Monster Hydro in 550-mL PET bottles in Sweden in January 2018 and in Germany in March 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in the United Kingdom and Sweden along with Monster Pipeline Punch in the United Kingdom and Belgium. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy brand in Pakistan and Cambodia. We launched Ultra White in Hong Kong and Macau in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we will launch Monster Ultra Citron in Korea along with Cuba Libre in Japan. We launched the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy Drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April of 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales will be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. April had one extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances where our bottles are responsible for production and unilaterally determined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice as bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not be necessarily imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions. In February 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy Drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is now open. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Afternoon. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, Hilton, I know you say you don't give guidance, but you did offer some kind of personal color on the fourth quarter call around expectations for gross margin where I think \u2013 where you guys settled out in the first quarter did fall short of that and I think will prove to be disappointing to investors. So can you just help talk us through where, relative to your fourth quarter commentary, gross margin missed your personal expectations? Thank you. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sure, sure. In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are one-off costs and some of which may well be ongoing as we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day. The Midwest, premium, freights, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India, and so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many non-controllable factors. So we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis. Operator : Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Hilton, following up on that comment on pricing, I guess we've seen price increases in this category during times of margin pressure in the past. And given the significant gross margin depression the last couple quarters and the continued commodity cost runoff, do you think you might look to take price increases in the U.S. at some point? And how do you guys think through the puts and takes of taking price increases? Thanks. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: What I said was we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis, and we do this irrespective of margin pressures. Obviously, when we do have margin pressures, it's something that surfaces again, and it's something that we are continually reviewing. And more than that, I just don't want to say at this time. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then could you guys talk about the health of the energy drink category in the U.S.? You mentioned weak beverage growth trends in general across the sector, but seemed more positive on the energy category. So where do things stand there and any worries about the potential impact on gas, convenience from the rising gas prices? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Last year, sort of, I think the whole industry was at a bit of a loss to understand why the convenience category had been growing, which had historically grown ahead of all markets, had sort of changed and started to slow down. What we're starting to see now is that the convenience category has really come back and is now growing ahead of the all measured channels. And so I think that we are starting to see this trend, which is quite encouraging. So I think we referred to some of the numbers. I'm just trying to think. The convenience was up 4.6% in the last 13 weeks, and I think it was up a little higher in the last five weeks. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: 5.6%. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: 5.6%. So it certainly is moving in the right direction and starting to solidify and gain traction again. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Afternoon. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. So could I go to the international? Can you speak about international growth? Because if you exclude the 2% inventory benefit that you highlighted in the January sales, it seems that your underlying sales internationally could have decelerated again to the high-single digit range. Is that what we should expect for a normalized rate of growth going forward? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, I don't think it's gone down to the high-single digits, and I think we did explain and drew the distinction in the markets to some of the geographic sales mix which also affected sales. If you look at the figures we gave you for Strategic Brands, which was down in dollars and marginally up, that has had a drag on our sales. The Monster sales internationally are still continuing to grow on quite a healthy basis. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Your line is now open. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Hilton and Rodney, look, I just want some big picture comments in terms of gross margins. I mean, a number of companies in the industry are facing what they call cyclical gross margin issues with aluminum lags and increasing prices. In your case, it seems to me that you face secular issues also going from single cans to pack sizes in the U.S., growing faster overseas than domestically. I mean, in China, your prices are much lower. So I don't know if it's possible, but if you could just help us understand in terms of these declining gross margins we're seeing, how much could we consider cyclical and how much will be secular? And the second question which is related to this. Other companies like, say, Buffalo, their gross margin story will be that they will bring in a lot of production in-house from third-party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean as you move distribution to the Coke system, is there an opportunity there to also shift production, or those bottlers were already producing your products? So just help us understand how much leeway or opportunity you have there in terms of structural changes that could help profitability and gross margins. And the very last one on the same topic... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Wait. Wait. Wait. You're now going on to the third question. We've lost track of the first one. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : (37:19). Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: No, no, go on. We're supposed to have one question at a time. Okay. So let's just \u2013 let me just start with production. All of our products of Coke PET we have a finished product model that's not going to change. What will change is as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing costs, of reducing freight, reducing import duties, and so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that. In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Where there are some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them; for example, a 24-ounce cap can for NOS in the U.S., we then are selling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we're obviously in the one case selling concentrate at a higher margin and in the other case we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin just because of the economics and the law of numbers. So that's on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower costs by improving our production and increasing the number of plants. That is also particularly so with regard to the newer products like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee product because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster, but we are looking to convert that to local production, which will again \u2013 which will assist in costs. And as we start ramping up with Caff\u00e9 Monster and others, we are looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We're looking to \u2013 in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming on board which will reduce costs. Could you take the first question, Hilton? Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I'm not... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: You don't know what the first question was. Do you want to repeat your first question? Hello? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Freda Zhuo on for Judy. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So my question is actually on China. So I think if you look at some of the channel data, it seems as though category growth has kind of taken a step down in 2018 closer to the 10% range. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground in terms of what might be driving some of that slower category growth? And then I caught a comment that you guys were repositioning or perhaps targeting some of the younger, more affluent demographics. So is that impacting the price point that you're placing Monster at in the market? Thanks. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. No, we're continuing with our price strategy, which was to remain competitive with Red Bull Gold, the Thai Red Bull. So that strategy is continuing. Our strategy is to maintain our products adjacent to Red Bull and to have what we call 3P execution, which is pricing competitive with Red Bull, point-of-sale, and position on shelf. So that is the target that we have set our bottlers, and we're moving forward in those accounts where we believe that we can achieve good sustainable sales. And our bottlers \u2013 I've just come back from China \u2013 have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumers can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. When our product is placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite, it doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is. So we are proceeding down our strategy, which we are supporting with a range of marketing media and social media. We've got a major computer game program that we are tying in with called Battleground, which is a significant property. We're moving forward on that strategy this year. So we always said that China would be a long-term development, and we're just staying the course. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. Just to \u2013 perhaps, if I would just add to that. Obviously, one of the challenges we're still having is the level of execution or quality of execution from the bottlers to execute the 3P that Hilton just alluded to, and that continues to be an ongoing challenge. We have seconded some of our key staff from the U.S. to really try and educate them and actually be able to really direct them and show them what we need to do. And we're confident that we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder road, and it will be achieved, and we will get there. With regard to the demographic, while we talk about the younger and more affluent, there hasn't been a change. In China, we have our product. It's carbonated. Our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product Thai Red Bull in China, and we believe that we're continuing with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world and it is aligned with Red Bull China, but that is at a premium to some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks. So that just will continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is just again getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to \u2013 the consumer doesn't have access to Facebook and YouTube that they have around the rest of the world. And we are improving and, obviously, taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiar with us through the local social media companies that have the equivalent channels and programs in China. Operator : And this ends the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn it back to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop, differentiate our brand, and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We are also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the Strategic Brands, as well as Hydro and Mutant. I hope to see you all at the Annual Stockholders Meeting in Corona on June 7, 2018, at 2 :00 PM. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today. Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance, is on a well-deserved vacation. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 8, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses. In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been $13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4% compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch and in connection with the current rollout as well as inventory reserves. Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We also are making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels including foodservice accounts and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018. In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 as an affordable energy brand in select eastern European and African markets. During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay and relaunched Monster in Peru. In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities principally in the south and west regions of India. We plan to complete a national rollout in India by year-end. Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018.

Our market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 31.1%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.5%. Red Bull sales decreased 2% and its market share decreased by 2.2 points to 9.5%. Vive 100 sales increased 14.6% and its market share decreased 2 points to 38%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 point to 7.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending July 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.5% to 12.2% in Belgium, from 15.2% to 16.8% in Germany, from 17.2% to 19.6% in Great Britain, from 5.7% to 7.2% in the Netherlands and from 27.1% to 29.1% in Spain.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 43.4% to 48.7% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these months. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2018 increased 14% from $815.3 million to $929.4 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Drinks Energy (sic) [Monster Energy Drinks] (17:12) segment in the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $5.1 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 14.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $15.5 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $79.8 million for the second quarter as compared to $85.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the second quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $7.1 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $16.8 million. Included in reported geographic sales, are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 21.4% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 27.5% in dollars and 17.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.8% compared to 49% in the same quarter [Technical Difficulties] (19:22). Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 46.5% for the second quarter. Gross profit in the region was impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Austria, Ultra Red in Switzerland, Romania, Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia, Ultra Sunrise in Croatia and Slovenia, and Ultra Violet in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $659.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $211.1 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we held no long-term investments. Accounts receivable increased to $592.6 million at June 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 45.2 days compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $275.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 62.7 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mule, a ginger-flavored energy drink exclusively with a large regional convenience store customer. Initial results have been positive. In Canada in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310ml can and a Collector's Edition Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in a 473ml can. We also launched Monster Mango Loco with 7-Eleven in Canada this June and we will roll out nationally in Canada during the third quarter of 2018. Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550ml PET bottles in France and BPM Zero in Ireland in June 2018. In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France and Germany, and Relentless Apple Kiwi in Great Britain. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy drink in Pakistan and Cambodia. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea. We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018 for Monster and January 1, 2019 for NOS and Full Throttle. We estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had one extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share, for a total of $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of August 7, 2018, approximately $196.7 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On August 7, 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points; One, the company's continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets. And I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you would like to ask a question... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, just \u2013 sorry. Could I just make \u2013 just one clarification. The price increase I referred to is related to the U.S. Sorry. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: All right, thank you. Operator : ...my pleasure. And our first question will come from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, just talk about international sales growth a little bit. We saw some deceleration across all three regions. Anything to note there or is it just part of normal volatility in these markets? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We think it's part of the normal operations. There have been some sort of \u2013 some noise \u2013 some countries were higher than others. We are looking at it, but we think that it's, again also distorted in some cases by monthly numbers. We are seeing quite big differences in the monthly numbers as we see them come through from overseas markets. So I think we'll just wait and see what the trend is going to be when we go through the third quarter. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair. If you look at the consolidated foreign numbers, including Canada, net sales grew at 18.69%. So we also have to adjust for ASC 606. So there are some variabilities in that, and overall we haven't seen a slowing in sales. There's just been some issues in certain countries, which we believe will correct themselves in the next few months. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Any abnormal inventory builds in any market that's worth pointing out to? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: No. Actually, there was inventory issues in the quarter, mainly in Europe, where unfortunately, there was insufficient production capacity to satisfy demand. They're having a very hot summer in Europe, as you know, and we've had some production challenges in Europe. So to the contrary, it's lower inventories rather than higher inventories. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hey, thanks, and good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So just a quick follow up on the last one and then another question. In Asia, it sounded like that was a little bit weaker. Maybe any sort of update on what's going on in China? Was there any sort of impact there from lapping the sell-in from a year ago? And then shifting to the U.S., just curious, anything you're seeing domestically? It looked like the trends, if I looked at it correctly, were a little bit below what the scanner data said consumption looked like, you said that online and on-track was doing well. So I don't know, anything that you see there that may have explained the delta? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, I think you'll always see a discrepancy between Nielsen and ourselves. And we've discussed this many times on various calls that we sell to our distributors. We also have some direct customers, but in the main, our sales go to our distributors. They sell to their customers, and their customers sell to retail. So you'll always see the discrepancy between Nielsen, which is retail sales, and our own sales. And what I've always advised is the real test is not what we're selling, but the real test is what's coming off the shelves. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, with regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities. There was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and, with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through, and our distributors to work through because we didn't \u2013 in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done it under the cap promotion this summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers focused on the modern trade in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities. So it's a slow build. It's steady. We are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly. It won't be in all the business units initially. It will be in the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line with an additional launch next summer early in 2019. We believe this is \u2013 it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It'll help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we've referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly in Coke coolers where some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well, and as we've said, the new products we've done some initial taste tests of them. They've been very well received. So we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that, Mark, is that remember we were rolling out China last year. So there was a buildup of inventory gain to the system last year. And Japan was good in the quarter. Korea was good in the quarter. So overall, I think we were satisfied with the numbers bearing in mind the differences in various countries. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Nik. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. A modeling question and then another question. On modeling, can you just \u2013 I know you don't want to give guidance for margins, et cetera, but just to help us think about it going forward, can you just rank order the factors weighing on gross margins kind of most impactful to least just to give us a better understanding? Because I guess when we look at the P&L and we look at the year-ago compares, promotional allowances are always listed first when you talk about gross margin pressure, and I know we're going to start lapping some of the Java promotional dollars as you are getting it back on the shelf. So that's the first question on gross margin. And then the second, the bigger picture question is, at the shareholder meeting, you talked about talking to the Coca-Cola Company about Mutant and potentially a new arrangement around that brand, and I just wanted to know if there is any progress there? Thanks. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. Well, if I could just answer the first question. Remember on a previous call, I spoke about a personal view about margins what I felt about personally. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606, and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind of within \u2013 is in that number. So the margin adjusting for those two factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotional answers and that is a fact and, yes, promotional answers are up, and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees. There is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell products such as the coffee product, Muscle Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster that are lower than the Monster cold food products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins are not as high as the U.S. margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Only thing I would add on to the margins is in addition, there's also been a switch between the proportion between we have strategic brands which have concentrated models which have higher margins and Monster. And Monster is continuing to grow ahead of the strategic brand, so that continues to put some pressure on the margin as well. So you take all those three factors on product mix, geographic mix, and mix between the actual product, the Monster versus strategic brands and that has had that effect. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So what I'm looking at here is that if you rank them in order, the point that Rodney mentioned was kind of at the bottom. So you've got all those other factors, plus you've got the strategic brands Monster percentages. And that should give you a full explanation to your question. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Very helpful. And then on Mutant? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: On Mutant, we have not made progress with the Coke Company on a different model. We're sort of reevaluating Mutant. We think that Mutant in the U.S. is probably something that's \u2013 we're probably going to tailor off and sort of refocus our attention. We're actually spending we think too much time and effort on the brand, and we just don't feel that that's where we would be best spent going forward. So I think that we're going to focus on newer products. We have some additional new product lines and some positioning in the Monster brand in the U.S. I think we're going to focus on that. We will continue to \u2013 have regard to Mutant as I indicated earlier internationally as an energy brand and Predator depending on the different markets. But at this point, we just don't see the reward and payback for Mutant in the U.S., so that seems to be something that we're de-emphasizing and moving away from I think going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, all. Hi. Good afternoon, there. I just wanted to actually explore a little bit more on the pricing, first of all, if you're seeing any signs of potential moves from your competitors? And then if you can kind of elaborate more if you're thinking of pricing also internationally. I know the pressures from COGS are less so of aluminum, but perhaps because of some places where FX may be going the other way, it hasn't been the case of course for you guys, but if you see some room for international pricing as well. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, we only really recently announced the pricing increase. Yeah, so we've really not really had any input back or heard anything back from our competitors. So we really can't give you much direction in that regard. We believe that they are undoubtedly also facing the same price and cost increases that we have, so we would believe that they probably will follow similarly, but we don't have any indication on that. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And then internationally, as we've always advised, we are the smaller player in many international markets and we price according to the leading competitor. And we just have to ensure that we are priced correctly relative to that competitor to be able to capture a good share of the market. So we would not lead \u2013 necessarily lead internationally without the lead competitor going first. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: But that being said, with all of the uncertainty that's been happening in the world with the aluminum price and some other raw material price increases, we are keeping a watch in different countries. And as and when there are price adjustments by leading brands and other competitors in those markets, we will react to that and obviously look at the opportunities as well individually for taking up pricing as and when we think that that's appropriate. But we are certainly focusing initially now on the U.S. pricing, and then which is the largest impact on our business, and then we will look at \u2013 probably early in the New Year look at the international markets. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good evening, guys. I was hoping for a follow up on the pricing, and then maybe some commentary on India. The follow up on the pricing is just to what extent will the pricing that you announced cover the input cost inflation that you're seeing? Is it adequate to cover all of it? Is it a large portion of it? So commentary there would be helpful. And then help me just building on sounds like a loose guidance or (42:46) your personal view before with the 62%. We've seen this with the presence of negative geographic mix, promotion, et cetera. So in theory, while those things will still be present to some degree, pricing has not been obviously. So should we be thinking about something a little bit better than that 62% as we get into Q4 and then looking out to next year? And then, Rodney, a broader question on India. Maybe talk a little bit about sort of early indications there, and how you're defining success in that market? Thank you for all that. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. So you're kind of getting greedy. The price increase should cover increases in input costs and the increases in freight. But who knows where they're going to go from there. I mean, today aluminum shot up again based on a number of factors. So as we sit here now, the pricing should contain our cost increases. Will we get more? I don't know, and I honestly I wouldn't consider even discussing more on this call because it's just too premature. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: If we increase pricing, I mean it's not going to have an effect through to us, certainly not in the current year. And then talking about India, we've had a controlled rollout, literally by city and surrounding region-by-region basis. It's gone well. We are seeing some good response. There is a recognition of the brand from when we were there many years before when we did sort of rollout and we were in India. We had a very limited presence but the brand was there, so we are seeing some recognition of the brand, which is good sort of very different to China where we really obviously had no brand recognition while we've launched. So it is different, and we are \u2013 but it really is premature. Hilton and I are both planning to go to India and review the markets and launch this ourselves personally within the next few months, but at this point it just is premature for us to comment on really what is happening there and how it's going. We're getting some good anecdotal reports but that's not sufficient for us to be comfortable to give you a direction from the company at this point yet. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for closing comments and remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thanks, everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going through with our portfolio together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and Predator in the affordable energy sector in many Eastern European, African, and other markets where that sector is continuing to show good growth opportunities. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. Gross and net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively. In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7%, from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7%, from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8%, compared with 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter, as compared with the $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and the administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter, as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter. Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributor transition in the United States. In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia. Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand. And plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end. Mutant energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreement with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed two energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. While mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018. Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7% and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%, Rockstar was down 12%, 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 of a share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.0 points to 33.7%, Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 of a point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caff\u00e9 Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 of a point, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 10% and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 37.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4% and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category drew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9% and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100 sales increased 27.6% and its market share decreased for 0.9 of a point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium; from 22.8% to 23.3% in France; from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain; from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands; from 15.3% to 18% in Norway; from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain; and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic; from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany; from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece; from 13.2% to 17% in Italy; and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland.

For the 13-week period ended September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 15.3% in South Africa, although the value of sales increased in the same comparative period. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share and value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September increased from 13.7% to 16.9% as compared to the same period last year. We launched Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, Argentina reached a 13.8% market share in value as of September 2018. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018, as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ending September 30, 2018, increased from 6.4% to 6.8%, as compared to the same period last year. Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 9.7% to 8.8%; and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 5.7%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 24.9% to 38.4% in the third quarter of 2018, versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018, versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales of the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter, as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter, as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, for the quarter was 41.3%, compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, would have been 44% for the third quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales, relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia, and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would've been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales, relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would've been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales was 44%, versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would've been 45.3%. Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter, largely due to supply issues. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million, compared $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million, compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018. Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the U.S. Initial results have been positive. In Canada in the third quarter of 2018, we launch Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy Drink and also re-launched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy Drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster Mixed Punch (00:27:51) in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia; Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia; and Monster Mango Loco in Germany. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Austria. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, PET bottles in Austria and Monster Mango Loco in Germany. Sorry, thank you. In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019. In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the quarter, and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus strategic brand in New Zealand to LIVE+ with three SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citron in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong. We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers, effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers, effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase, effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would've been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would've been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production \u2013 in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the days on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any other future period. No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy Drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Due to time limitations, we ask that you keep your questions to one only. Our first question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good evening, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Amit. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Amit. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, can you provide a little bit more context into the energy drink brands being developed by Coca-Cola? How far along are they or any other information on it, please? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that we have some information, but we don't have full information. And I think that now that an arbitration has been filed between us to try and determine our respective rights, we just believe that it isn't appropriate for us to provide additional comments at this time. Our commercial business activities and relationship is continuing as in the past, and we are looking to just get a third-party determination for the correct interpretation of our respective rights. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, Rodney, just as a follow-up, just a quick follow-up on the last question. I mean, maybe if you could take a little bit of a step back and just kind of give your perspective on the relationship that's been evolving with The Coca-Cola Company. Obviously, the Mutant situation didn't also go as well as I think that you were hoping for. So kind of how do you see this changing your relationship with the KO, as well as the bottlers? So maybe just be helpful to just get your broader perspective. And then, more specifically, my other question is just really on the EMEA supply chain issues. I'm just wondering if this is limited to certain countries or this is really a broader regional issue. And whether this is being addressed as we speak, so we get more of a bump up in sales in the fourth quarter? It seems like we've been having some of these supply chain issues in international markets time-to-time. So how do we think about really more fully addressing the issue broadly? Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: That's a lot for one question, Judy. Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A follow-up, one was a follow-up. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. On the relationship with Coke, I think our relationship is good and continues to be good. There is Coke, obviously, looking at their own portfolio and looking for where they believe they see opportunities and where their own BUs would look to expand their own portfolio. As we indicated in the call, there is an exception for certain products that are in the Coca-Cola brand and that is of itself an area that we are looking at. We have a difference of opinion on it. We don't know and at this point we don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on if that comes to fruition, what effect that might or might not have on our brand. I mean, we continue to be partners with Coca-Cola and with the bottlers. We continue to have our full range sold by them. And we just don't think that at this point we'd be in a position or should be in a position to speculate on what effect that might happen. There will just be another product being sold by Coca-Cola bottlers, but the impact and effect on us would be something I think wouldn't be appropriate for us to deal with that. We don't believe it will have a majority impact on our relationship. We just believe we'll have to manage it in an appropriate way if and when it occurs. On the EMEA supply chain side, I think... Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, Rodney. Maybe I could give a different perspective to Judy or a similar perspective. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sure. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: The relationship with The Coca-Cola Company, I believe, is good. And I'm not a lawyer, so I'm giving the response to you from a business perspective. There is an issue in an agreement, which we've agreed to go to arbitration civilly and determine what course of action is appropriate. So nothing has changed in the relationship. And the manner in which this situation will be dealt with will be conducted from both parties on a civil basis according to the agreement. So I honestly don't see any changes in the relationship with The Coca-Cola Company. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sure. All right. On the EMEA supply chain side, it affected us through a number of plants in different areas, not obviously right through all of the \u2013 there are probably 70 or 80 countries that comprise EMEA, but there were a number of countries and a number of plants that did have supply issues for a whole host of reasons. We've taken steps to address this. We had a period of time when our previous Senior VP of Operations retired and we were looking for a successor. We have appointed a successor who is \u2013 he has got his feet on this desk and he's in the job, he's been out in Europe. We have also appointed a new VP of Operations in Europe to give us more hands on deck there. And so, we are looking at getting our hands around it. We are in the process of doing it at this point in time. Perhaps if you'd like to add some color to that? Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: No, I think that we've had issues. Remember, it was a very hot summer in Europe and a lot of the plants were working to capacity and beyond capacity. We've had certain issues, which are being addressed and will be addressed going forward. And the one thing is clear is that our business is growing, which is a good thing. And we have to ensure that we have sufficient capacity and sufficient plants to be able to accommodate our needs. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I was hoping to talk about your U.S. business and specifically the trends for your core Green Monster, where, at least in the Nielsen scanner data that we have, it does appear that there has been a modest softening in terms of the market share declines. So can you offer any color on whether there has been a change in your promotional strategy heading into the price increase or is this more interaction with new product offerings that are hitting the market? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: If I'm looking at the general market, Monster is continuing to increase its share. The category is growing and Monster is growing in excess of the market. If I look at regular Monster as such, I'm just looking, for example, at the main channel, which is convenience, there is still some growth in Monster in the original core line in its 16-ounce. And then, obviously, we have additional SKUs with the original Green Monster. So the core brand is continuing to grow. There has been the entry into the market of additional products, primarily probably in what we would maybe call or describe as a performance energy category or a workout fitness energy category or not even really maybe in that category. And there is some sales on that. There are a number of reasons that those products are all sort of starting to gain some traction. But if I look at the sales levels, they are still behind the increase in sales. So I think, overall, we are getting additional products in the category, but the category itself is continuing to grow. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So we're still seeing growth, Vivien, in Monster Green. It's continuing to grow. And remember, we've added a number of other SKUs into the portfolio on both juice products and the Ultra range, which is the no-sugar product. So while we are seeing growth in Monster Green, there has been as well the proliferation of other SKUs within our portfolio. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. In that side, obviously on the coffee side, we are continuing to see growth in Java. We've just launched a line extension in Java. We have the Caff\u00e9 Monster line and Espresso Monster again, that has continued to grow. On the Ultra line, which is growing, we do have plans to launch an additional Ultra in the spring, which will be launched, which is Ultra Paradise. So we are all continuing to see growth in the category. And we see additional entrants probably to some extent. We are not sure of the exact measurement at this point in time, but do see some increase in incremental sales coming into the category from these new entrants. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And Monster Green does remain a very important barometer for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I'm going to try the Coke thing again. You can answer or not, I guess. My understanding of the exceptions relate to the specific products or specific ingredients which is in there. So are we talking about a product in similarity to, say, a Kickstart from the Pepsi system, where it's effectively sort of a competitor, but not really? Are they adding some sort of caffeine component to some other beverage, which is a non-carbonated soft drink? I mean, any sort of color you can give on that, that would be helpful. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Mark, there isn't a limitation on them just adding caffeine. They could have a higher caffeine product, there's no limitation on that. There is, if you look at the agreement, which is filed, there are certain ingredients that are, if used in combination, obviously then create a definition. And there is a definition of what an energy drink is. The exception goes back to the Coca-Cola brand, not Sprite, not Kickstart, not any other brand, it's the Coca-Cola brand. And there are certain exceptions about what \u2013 because the Coke brand has certain \u2013 otherwise there would be certain limitations. And there is an exception for that brand. But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do under that brand. Again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that. But where the brand transcends into a product that we see positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception and under the Coke brand. That is really where we are. I think there is not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up if you really had that interest. But we are dealing with it with Coke. And we think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and how it should be implemented. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And just to add on that, Mark, what I said earlier, the discussions are very civil and very business-like, very civil. And it's a question of difference of opinion, which will be resolved in per the agreement. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Afternoon, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just a little bit further on the gross margin, but for kind of the quarter and then going forward with pricing. Trying to understand, as we look, will this more than offset \u2013 I mean, can you hold gross margins relatively flat going forward? And when I say that, have we seen the full impact of costs in the third quarter? Or do you still have another kind of layer or step-up of cost input inflation that kicks in fourth quarter and 2019? Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, what's interesting looking at aluminum and the tariffs and the imposition of tariffs were announced way after we had our discussion on this call about gross margins. So we've had this increase in tariff, which has resulted in increase of aluminum, which is slowly coming off, right? It's a very slow process. So we've also had extreme increases in freight-in in costs that we account for cost of sales, where product is moved to our co-packers or moved to our warehouses. That's all included in cost of sales. So we have had significant cost increases in that regard as well. So we have these cost increases. I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum and I'm not seeing further increases in freight either, but anything is possible. Having said that, we will have price increase from November 1. And the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year. So it's kind of a mixed bag, with increases and cost increases, which is exactly why we were forced into having a price increase. So \u2013 but I hope that answers your question. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. I think I understand, but I guess it's more of, do you see any need for further price increases from here? Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, we've announced a price increase in NOS and Full Throttle, which we spoke about on the call. We are proposing a price increase in Canada, which we discussed on the call. And where we are now with regard to price increases, I'm not sure we will \u2013 having implementing a price increase in November 1, I'm not sure there is runway to do it again within a short period of time unless costs dramatically and significantly increase from where they are today. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. At this point, we haven't sort of envisaged price increases in other places around the world, but I think that is something we will be evaluating and looking at the markets, the elasticity where we \u2013 if we can justify pricing. We'll evaluate that going early in the new year. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: See, in the United States, we really are now the market leader. In the various countries around the world, we really price ourselves after Red Bull in most cases. And we don't want the difference between our pricing and Red Bull's pricing to be significantly out of whack. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. Thanks. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Thank you. That ends our Q&A session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any further remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We also particularly excited by the new opportunities we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our Strategic Brands, as well as Hydro, Mutant and, in particular, Predator. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, you may all disconnect.

You have joined Monster Beverage Corporation's 2018 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Sacks : Hi, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our last Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2019. A copy of this information is also available on our Web site at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. Net and gross sales for the three months ended December 31 2018, were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks in 2018 which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1%, from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7%, from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7%, compared with 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs, geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins. Domestic product sales mix and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales process as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and non-cash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rates decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U. S. Federal Statutory tax rate as a result of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with The Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a one-time provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and a one-time charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post 1986 earnings and profits as a result of The Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction. Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $575 million for the fourth quarter 2017 to $556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43, from $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coco-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels including foodservice accounts, e-commerce, and home improvement stores. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically-preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa in the fourth quarter, and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa throughout 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. We are now in track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019. In China, we had a limited launch of Monster Ultra Light in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. Ultra's innovation has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster Ultra this quarter and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019. We continue the rollout of Monster across India with expansion to top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing. I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our law school, and that's our Investor Presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coco-Cola Company. As we reported, our various agreements with The Coco-Coal Company restrict the Coco-Cola Company from competing in the Energy Drink category with certain exceptions. Coco-Cola has developed three energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coco-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coco-Cola over the interpretation of that exception. By mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively. Coco-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy products until April 2019. We cannot predict the certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published, but reasonably expect the resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners. According to the Nielsen Reports for the 13-week through January 26, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category including Energy Shots increased by 11.3% versus the same period a year ago.

The previous year while NOS was up 3.6%. And Full Throttle was up 4.9%. Sales of Red Bull up 11.7%, Rockstar was down 4.8%, 5-Hour down 0.12% and AMP was down 33.6%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, Monster's market share the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars decreased by .7 share point over the same period last year to 37.1%. NOS's share declined 0.4 share point to 3.9% and Full Throttle's share declined 0.1 share point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.4 point to 33.7%. Rockstar share was down 1.2 points to 6.4%, 5-Hour share was lowered by 0.8 points at 6.2%, and Amp's share decreased 0.4 point to 0.6% and is 4.9% up 4.3 share points. According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, sales of coffee plus Energy Drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 21% over the same period previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 15.5% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of coffee plus energy were 29.2% higher while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 11.7% higher. Our company share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 58%, up 3.7 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 50.1%, down 2.4 points, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy share was 41.9%, down 3.5 points. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 02, 2019, the Energy Drink category increased 7% in dollars.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drinks brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11% to 12.7% in Belgium; from 24.3% to 24.8% in France; from 18.8% to 20.3% in Great Britain; from 7.1% to 7.3% in the Netherlands; from 28.9% to 13.3% in Spain.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.4% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 46.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.9% from $736.1 million to $853.3 million from the comparable period in 2017.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $274.3 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to $210.4 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $14.4 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through the supply chain and production issues. Certain of our cofactors that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars, and increased 23.2% in local currencies over the same period in 201. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.8% in dollars and 28.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 42.1%, compared to 47.5% in the same quarter in 2017.

We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in the EMEA markets. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.  We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden.

Short-term investments were $320.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Net accounts receivable increased to $484.6 million at December 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 41.4 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $277.7 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 67.2 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family as an exclusive launch for certain customers, and are now in the prices of national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive. We are currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradox, a line extension in our Ultra family, as well as Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4 ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family, as well as rebranding NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. In March, we are planning to launch our Reign Total Body Fuel in six flavors. We are also planning on launching two flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and [indiscernible] Marty. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line as white tea. During January 2019, in Canada we launched two additional line extensions of Monster Hydro namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching three flavors of our caf\u00e9 Monster line in the 13.7 ounce gloss package in Canada. In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018 we launched our Lewis Hamilton Energy Drink. Initial results have been positive. We are planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2108, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland, and South Africa. Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first-half of 2019. Monster Mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster is also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first-half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Burn Lemonades in Russia, VPM Orange Zero in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa, and Burn Mango in the Baltics. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with a convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco market-wide. We have experienced manufacturing issues relating to Mango Loco product in Australia. We anticipating that we'll be able to resolve these issues and resume product supply to both Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter and re-launch at retail in the third quarter of 2019. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased the prices of our concentrates for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019 by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a cost increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019 for Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate that January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher in comparable January 2018 gross sales. In this regard, we note and as explained on our fourth quarter 2017 call that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017, ForEx adjusted to 25.1%, was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales, following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; (B) Initial shipments of Caff\u00e9 Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and (C) Moreover innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales. No new innovation was launched by us in the U.S. in January 2019. This year our innovation in the U.S. namely Monster Ultra Paradox and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate is being launched nationally this week, and Reign and two additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. The increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned about should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales. In this regard, we are cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor in terms of what's shipped in the timing of production, and this is where our bottles are responsible for production, and will accurately determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained via distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short-term such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock, at an average purchase price of 56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019 and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million excluding broker commissions. As of February 26, 2019, approximately 20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to say summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrated that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets, and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets. We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year-end, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open. Caroline Levy : Thank you very much, good afternoon. Rodney Sacks : Hi, Caroline. Caroline Levy : Hi, Rodney. Just a quick question on -- a clarification if you could repeat the January sales, that would be helpful. I think I heard 2% and 4%, but just want to clarify. And then if you could just tell us a little bit more about how things are going in China. You mentioned about $3 million in losses in the quarter, how does that progress over the course of last year? Are the losses about where you expected them to be, do you think we will have another lost year next year and how do you feel about the progress in China overall? Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Let's just deal with the January sales. January sales were up -- sorry, 2.7% in January and on a foreign currency adjusted basis 4.6%. Rodney Sacks : So Caroline, you got the point about January '18 sales being higher than ordinarily they should have been. So we spent a bit of time just talking about that. Caroline Levy : Yes. Rodney Sacks : Go back to the same call we had a year ago and pick up some of those sentiments that we expressed exactly the same at that time. Caroline Levy : Okay. Oh, got it. Rodney Sacks : And I think obviously -- and then taking that into account, we have obviously also given you the Nielsen numbers for January and you obviously February, so we do caution about this being a single month on a highly stacked January from last year. Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So Caroline, just talking very briefly about China, the loss for the quarter was very much in line with what we'd expected. We are seeing a lot of what we call green shoots in China in the major chains, our volumes per outlet are very respectable compared to what we've seen for Red Bull. And the launch of Ultra was particularly pleasing and it's growing in strength. As regards this year, we again are adjusting for a loss in China and we absolutely committed to success in that territory. So we know it'll be an investment and we know it'll take some time to realize profitability in China and our co-colleagues have expressed and shared with us similar sentiments, but we are committed and we would believe that we will be successful in China. Rodney Sacks : e : Hilton Schlosberg : And just to add that the bottlers, likewise, are excited about the opportunities that the Monster brand presents for them in China. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : Hey, hey guys. Rodney Sacks : Hello, Mark, hi. Mark Astrachan : So I guess, maybe one question broadly on gross margins. I don't want to ask you for guidance or anything like that, Hilton, but I guess, the numbers were still a little bit weaker than we or probably others would've expected. So how much of it is aluminum? I mean, I get the freight piece, I think most of it will get the freight piece, but what we don't see is how much inventory for aluminum you bought in 2008 potentially at much higher prices. So maybe if you could talk a bit about the cadence of that kind of cycling through and when kind of directionally some of that should lessen so without actually getting guidance, but just in terms of the inputs, puts and takes to how long before you start seeing lower price inventory kind of work through would be helpful. Hilton Schlosberg : Well, you know, as we look at aluminum, aluminum did start coming down to us a ladder quarter of last year. We from time to time execute hedges with our aluminum can companies and we had some hedges in place for the fourth quarter of last year ready to protect ourselves against Aluminum going significantly up as it had been for most of the year. So that's the picture of aluminum. Aluminum coming down, re-buying it at various processing, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion; not for all, but for a portion of our Aluminum. So as we head into 2019, Aluminum in our books would definitely start coming down. By how much I really can't say, and I'm not at liberty to say, but it will be coming down in 2019. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon. Hi. I appreciated your updates on the price increase internationally, and you mentioned Canada up 3% starting on February 1st. Do you think I'm just laying your comments before that your price, respect for your price elasticity in some places. So do you think we should be thinking of that being the last price increase so far given what Hilton just said about aluminum potentially coming down, or is that\u2026 Rodney Sacks : No, I think that there are some selected countries in EMEA where we are we have taken certain price increases, and will continue to take some price increases this year. But I just don't have a list of them with me and at this point we wouldn't like to expand further on that. So there will be some. But obviously, we will also take that into account when we look at the Aluminum prices in what it costs us going forward. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Your question please. Amit Sharma : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Rodney Sacks : Hi. Amit Sharma : A quick clarification, and then a question on -- from a EMEA -- the supply chain disruptions and production issues, how much did it cost in terms of your sales growth for that segment, right, in the quarter. And then, as we think about the gross margin in U.S., it's clearly a little bit weaker than what we were expecting, and I hear your point on the commodity, but there's also a sales mix aspect of it. Can you unpack that a little bit, provide us some clarity that how much of a headwind that is, and how it could continue even after you overcome the commodity headwinds? Rodney Sacks : Okay. So regarding EMEA, it's not a precise science, and unfortunately, I just don't want to give you a number for what the impact of these supply chain issues in EMEA were in the fourth quarter. We have made some stabs at the number. We've been reviewing it continuously since the middle of 2018, but I'd rather just stay away from giving some indication of what that number is. I don't think it would be appropriate to do so. But what I can say to you is that we believe the number was in excess of a million cases, and I'm going to stop there in the fourth quarter. Amit Sharma : Got it. Perfect, thank you. And then gross profit impact from sales mix in U.S? Rodney Sacks : So there definitely is an impact on sales in the U.S., and if you what we try to do is on the call is prioritize the reasons for the decrease in gross profit and you'll notice from the call that number one was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs. Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our International sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales and our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So, while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the number, the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign products they will all be at the more traditional launch the margins and not at the coffee margins. So they will be higher than the coffee margins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Laurent Grandet : Yes, good afternoon Rodney and Hilton. I do have a question on Reign. I noticed on the packaging doesn't carry any reference to Monster the clue or even on the back it says I mean the company manufacturing it is the Reign beverage company, so I'm curious to understand why you are not leveraging your brand name as it would be a bit more A&M intensive to launch a new brand from scratch, I'd like to understand also the first reaction from the trade on the Reign? Rodney Sacks : Well, let me just talk about that. We the positioning of Reign is different to the positioning of Monster and we've made the strategic decision to not in fact make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to we think it should be positioned have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality and that we believe will give its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers. They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to what we believe it will expand the energy category. What it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with a sort of a slightly different energy formula formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing, so that doesn't preclude us. We just feel that and in fact it's better. And it does enable us to position the brands differently and get more shelf space. We think that would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions and we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for months that we've already described a number of them to you that are being launched. We actually have additional launches and sub launches planned for Monster later in the year. So we've got quite a full plate for Monster and you can't do everything under one brand and that's the reason that we've positioned it as we have. Hilton Schlosberg : And I think it's also important to note that we're continuing with rollouts of Friends under the strategic brands and new flavors. So we're not neglecting the strategic brand segment either. Rodney Sacks : Just as regard to retailers again, where it's being rolled out in March. So it's premature but the acceptance from retailers and to the brand to the positioning to the taste profile that we've done in the packaging has been very positive. We're actually very happy with it and we are going to have a focused and concerted rollout in March. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your question please? Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good afternoon. Rodney Sacks : Hi, good afternoon Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Quick cleanup question I hope, I know your inclination and the pension historically has not been to guide but Hilton can you just confirm for us that given the moving parts and you understand the comments are in input cost and mix and but you have full-year pricing going in, do you expect gross margins to be higher and you could just confirm that that would be helpful. And then Rodney on pricing, can you talk about Red Bulls pricing posture. So from a U.S. perspective, they clearly haven't followed yet. Is that concerning? Is there a point at which you consider rolling back pricing or promoting it back through trade and then maybe internationally, what are you seeing from them. Do you think will be further opportunity to price beyond what you've outlined on this call? Thank you for that. Rodney Sacks : Kevin, I'll just take the last question first. Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of the promotions, more so that in previous years and to try and pick up some volume in share. Would that be losing for some time. We've seen that, it doesn't affect us. We've I think been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve and we're not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We're satisfied with where we've got with pricing and we think the pricing is fine. And so we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins and they won't continue indefinitely. But that's -- we can't speculate as to what's in their heads but whether they do so or not. We don't believe that would be a factor for us or any materiality quite frankly and so we're moving forward with our plans. Hilton Schlosberg : So just to add a little bit to that, the price increase that was planned was really carefully planned in relation to Red Bulls pricing where there were significant gaps between our price on shelf and where Red Bull was at that time. And what we were able to do with our price increase was move us closer to the Red Bull pricing. So if you look at the -- at the pricing in the 4% that we implemented, the objective was to get pretty close to where Red Bull had their products priced in the market. And obviously we're only talking about the U.S. And then on your other point on gross margin, you know Kevin, I didn't have to give you guidance because we don't give guidance, but you've got all the facts, you know that aluminum is coming down. We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that there and we've also spoken about our new products and that the new products are largely going to be focused on better margin products. So you can come to your own conclusion. I think you know where I'm heading, and how can I give any guidance or any discussion on margin, but I think that's enough for you to able to work it out. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the past. We continue to believe in this company, and our growth strategy remains committed to continuing to innovate, develop, and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of Energy Drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy Brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and in particular Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attention and your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Sacks Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I\u2019m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2019, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 2, 2019. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 60.6% for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our product sold in North America, and to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $8.6 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, this is a non-cash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter of 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increasing profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than in United States. Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group\u2019s distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States. We incurred no distributed termination costs and received no deferred revenue connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser\u2019s territory, which is located in the New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to all Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week, and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter. In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which will continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019. I'll now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we\u2019ve stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category, with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed three energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception, relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market and distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing on the schedule the parties agreed two months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola\u2019s entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners. I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention. Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provide benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019. In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have two comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid-January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX\u2019s complaint, which set forth our opposition in detail, and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are subjudicate, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks to April 20, 2019, all assets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, merchandise, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 2.4% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased 7.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 8.6% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 6.2%. Sales of Amp decreased 45.3%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 9% over the same period in the previous year. Sales of Monster decreased by 2.3% over the same period the previous year, while NOS was down 3.2% and Full Throttle was down 10.6%. Sales of Red Bull were up 6.7%, Rockstar was down 14.6%, 5-Hour was down 8.1% and Amp was down 44.4%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 4 points over the same period of previous year to 34.1%. NOS\u2019s share declined 0.5 share points to 3.7% and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 points to 0.8%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.7 of a point to 33.9%, Rockstar share was down 1.5 points to 5.5%, 5-Hour\u2019s share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.7% and Amp share decreased 0.4 of a point to 0.4%. VPX Bang's share is 8.3% and Reign's share is 1.7%. In view of the recent launch of Reign, we're giving you an update on its performance. According to Nielsen, for the one-week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the one-week is already 2.5%, while Bang\u2019s market share in dollars in that week is 8.3%. According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now includes Caff\u00e9 Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 9.1% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 1.3% higher, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 9.3% higher. Our company\u2019s share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 53.5%, down 3.5 points. Java Monster\u2019s share on its own for the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 47.3%, up 0.5 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.4%, up 0.6 of a point. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 30, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars. Monster sales increased 7% versus a year ago. Monster\u2019s market share increased 0.9 of a share points to 33.9%.

NOS sales increased 75.6 and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while Boost\u2019s market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA, vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain and from 12% to 13.2% Sweden.

According to INTAGE, in Japan, Monster\u2019s market share in value in the convenience store channel grew from 47.9% in the 2018 first quarter to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2019. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months. For the Monster Energy drinks segment in the first quarter 2019 increased 11.5% from $780.5 million to $870.4 million from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the month of energy drink segment in the third quarter of 2019 will negatively impacted by approximately $18.2 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $70.3 million for the first quarter, as compared to $65.8 million in the same quarter in 2018.

Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $22 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company military customers, which are in the U. S. and France shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In the EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter. It not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out of stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in the EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our core factors that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 12.5% in dollars and increased 22.3% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.2%, compared to 44.5% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a high percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brand in the region. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 29.6% in dollars and 34.2% in local currencies over the same in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.2%.

Average days of inventory were 72.7 days at March 31, 2019 compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018. We have successful launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well two -- an additional two flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we booked out the last family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the re-branding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate lead launch from 2018 to all customers in February 2019 and added two flavors in our Dragon Tea line Green Tea and Yerba Mate which launched in March. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in six flavors, initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched two additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Fashion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March, we launched our Caff\u00e9 Monster line in 13.7-ounce re-sealable glass package. In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019 we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. The initial results have been positive. In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue to rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically in Monster ultra blue and gray Brazil in Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019. There is SKUs in the Monster Ultra line 39 EMEA markets. In Australia we successfully launched the new flavor across in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our used customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results for the implementation of this price increase. For Monster expenses as percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1 2019 by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019 for the Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis April 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. It was one more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018. In this regard we cautioned the guiding that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and for promotional retail stores. Distributing incentives as well as shift in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the day which we such bottlers as very inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously-authorized repurchase program. In conclusion I'd like to summarize a recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks which launched in March are positive and we are encouraged by the prospect for this line. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets. Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the USA in the second half of 2019. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Stephen Powers : Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, it's worth asking about, but I guess maybe just start on your thoughts on U.S. pricing relative to the competition. And now that you've got your innovation out in the marketplace, should we expect to see incremental promotional dollars allocated to those initiatives? And I guess, how much do you think those initiatives will be allocated against Reign versus against the base Monster franchise? I guess, what I'm really asking about is, how much if at all do you think incremental promotional investment is likely to offset the list price increases you took late last year as you go forward throughout the balance of 2019? Rodney Sacks : Okay. Steve you will see that in this quarter when results that we actually improved promotional allowances in this quarter. So the promotional allowances are reducing. However in the next quarter we're planning and this is really planned, nothing to do with any sales or sales mixes, but we had already planned a BOGO which is a buy one get one ready to get Reign exuviated more intensively than it was in the -- with the launches. Part of the launching plan and you will see that happen in the second quarter. Apart from anything else, we are watching the market. We're watching Red Bull's crossing very carefully. And we'll make adjustments if we think it will have a long-term impact. However, what we see and you'll see that as well is the majority of Red Bull's growth is actually coming from innovation. Stephen Powers : Okay. Great. So just a follow-up quickly. The big incremental innovation is tied to the launch of Reign which I think makes sense. And then now you have Ultra Paradise and some of your newer Monster SKUs in the marketplace. Any incremental promotion? It sounds like from your -- from what you just said, we should assume goes to those new innovations as opposed to -- against the base SKUs. Is that a fair way to think about it? Rodney Sacks : I'm not sure I said that. When we promote Monster, we promote the line. But what I did say was that with regard to Reign, you'll see a special promotion in the ensuing quarter which will be due to a previously planned BOGO which is buy one get one to really kickstart the launch of Reign. Stephen Powers : Perfect. Okay. Rodney Sacks : During the quarter we will be -- we had some timing differences on our promotions last year in the first quarter where we didn't have the same depth of promotion this year. But going into the second quarter, we will be promoting Monster pretty much in accordance with the normal promotional schedule that we plan for summer. Tom Kelly : I think Steve Kristen was -- because of the pricing the increased pricing it will be more access of coming on through this Monster. Rodney Sacks : Correct. Stephen Powers : Yes. Okay. That's clear. Thanks guys. Rodney Sacks : Yes. Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi, everyone. Rodney Sacks : Hi, Judy. Judy Hong : I guess, I wanted to ask about Reign more specifically whether or how much it contributed to 1Q sales as well as the April sales, because obviously there is a pretty big divergence in terms of the Nielsen numbers and your reported numbers? And then I guess more broadly on Reign, can maybe just talk a little bit more about the performance of the brand so far? How much do you think it take your share away from Bang versus maybe expanding the category? Or how much is sort of cannibalizing your brands? And how quickly do you think that we can to full distribution? Rodney Sacks : On the contribution of Reign, Reign contributed about $25.5 million of sales to the first quarter. Tom Kelly : Net sales. Rodney Sacks : Net sales. Yes. We don't have the -- we're not going to go into the number in April that's just a -- we give the gross numbers as opposed to breaking that up. And I think Judy to answer the balance of your question I think it's just too early for us to tell exactly what is taking from what. You can see the numbers from Nielsen has been some affected since. Obviously, there is a new entrant and participant in the category. It's taking share from all the products. But ultimately we do believe that Reign will continue to increase itself and establish itself that is the reason why we're actually looking at the first promotion we got with Reign. It hasn't been promoted until now. And so you got to get the first promotion coming through in the second quarter on Reign. And we will continue to pull out. We did get some pretty good distribution initially from the Coke bottlers, but it will continue to hold out as we go into the second quarter. Judy Hong : Thank you. Tom Kelly : Just to add to that Judy, it\u2019s really the launch exceeded our expectation. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Hey, afternoon guys. Rodney Sacks : Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask a question on white space and opportunity for products. So you commented on Ultra being available in I think 38 EMEA markets. It got me thinking so, how do you think about U.S. innovation in terms of what the white space would be for existing franchises as well as just new franchises where you're putting the stuff on shelves. Meaning, it seems like Reign is getting on the new shelf. Is that fair? How do you think about the existing energy shelves? And then outside of the U.S., how do you think about taking successful innovation like Hydro, Java and taking it global. Where are you in the rollout of SKUs versus where it would be? Obviously, there is a lot of that and still maybe just kind of broader strokes of how you think about what the opportunity can be. I think that would be helpful. Rodney Sacks : I think you mentioned this Mark on previous calls, where the determination is made together with the local management about -- in each country thought which SKUs we should launch, which SKUs are appropriate to the consumer needs in that country. And there is a rollout which is dependent on opportunities and you've seen we've done that. I mean, on this call we mentioned a number of countries where we have launched additional SKUs. And we will continue to do so. But one thing we will not do is roll out all our SKUs in all our countries, because that's not a good approach to addressing the market. In China, for example, we already have three SKUs. We have the original Monster. We have Ultra. And we have Mango. So we have three SKUs now in China. And if you look at other countries we success for the -- and success we\u2019ve done that. In EMEA, we've done that and we continuing to do that. Tom Kelly : In most of these countries, we really are -- there isn't a cookie cutter sort of formula. We look at the countries. We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand, because that's what it's stands for. But from then on we look at the individual countries. They flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second or third SKU many countries differ from country-to-country. And then depending on the response we get. In some countries, we get really good response to Ultra. We then change the track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra product. And perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order is changed a little bit. Mango has got very well received. Popcorn is being very well received. And so we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that format. It may go in the form of a tea likers. Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries and we are looking at that into non-core. And as you've been seen we have taken the step also some testing to look at coffee. In Europe we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we're also looking at some other potential coffee products into the UK market. Again looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunities for that. And once we look at that, and again reach the right progression in other countries we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country-by-country as we have launched in the country as the bottle is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow. That we'll continue to build out over years our portfolio is going to continue to grow, continue to build out internationally. In the U.S., while we've launched, we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases in order to -- because of timing and because of reset in order to get products on shelf, it has been put onto the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are agreed that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category. It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's a high ring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space. Rodney Sacks : And Mark, to reinforce that earlier comment that certain flavor profiles that do really well overseas and don't do well in the U.S. For example, one of my favorite Monster products is the Ultra Citron. And a decision was taken that we would probably should discontinue it in favor of other Ultra products. And that Ultra Citron has been launched in the bunch of international countries Japan, Korea and a bunch of countries across Europe because of its less sweet profile. So each country will determine -- with obviously with direction from the Senate, the product that best suit the consumer needs in those countries. Tom Kelly : Just to add, I think it hasn't been launched yet in Japan or Korea. Mark Astrachan : Thank you. Tom Kelly : It has. Rodney Sacks : Between us they are not certain with\u2026 Tom Kelly : I believe it has. Yes. Rodney Sacks : Okay. Tom Kelly : And again\u2026 Rodney Sacks : Yes. Tom Kelly : The concept that a major product that will see in other countries that we may not even launch in the U.S. or they may launch in, they just -- we discontinued in the U.S. Rodney Sacks : Yes, agreed. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Sharma : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Sacks : Hi. Amit Sharma : Rodney if we take Reign out from Q1 sales and look at the rest of the US portfolio around 4.2 - growth, all right. And most of that coming from pricing? And you talked about that you will watch Red Bull price like at what point do you get worried about the volume performance of the core Monster brand in U.S. and not just price accordingly? Rodney Sacks : I think we've got a whole beverage portfolio. And you're going to take the portfolio as a whole in time. I think that we did mention I think earlier that for timing reasons they were certain promotions that we've done last year that fairly to earlier periods where we had some Nielsen updates that didn't get repeated this year. They are falling into -- probably into the second quarter now. So we \u2013 overall, we are comfortable with the brands. There is a sort of change going on in the industry at the moment. There's a change in \u2013 obviously, finding shelf space, people are trying some of these new high-performance drinks. We think a lot of that will stop. The noise will stop settling down. We think there will be growth. Overall, we're still -- we're comfortable with our innovation. Ultra Paradise is now got on to shelves and is really doing well. Innovation in coffee. The Swiss coffee is doing well. We have additional innovation planned in the months to line later in the year. And so we are comfortable that overall we will continue to grow. Tom Kelly : Yes. Amit just remember that our launches took place February the 21st for Hydro. So there's two new flavors in seven 50. For Java the Swiss Chocolate; for Ultra Paradise, last Snapple that is all February the 21st. And in March the 21st, we had Reign and we had Dragon Tea. So the launches took place really towards the end of the quarter. And -- but as I said earlier, we will be monitoring Red Bull and we'll take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the business continues to grow. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good evening Rodney and Hilton. Congrats on a strong quarter. I would try to have a second shot at Crane, because we don't have so much, I mean, Nielsen reliable numbers for now. So I think you said Reign was representing about 2.5% in the last week of April when Bang was about 8.3% I guess\u2026 Rodney Sacks : Correct. Laurent Grandet : Yes. That's correct, yes. So it seems like Rodney Sacks : The Market share yes. Tom Kelly : Market share in convenience. Laurent Grandet : Market share, yes, in market share. So it seems like since you had those two, it feels like a 23% of the new \u2013 rain represent about 22% of the new category. That's a great result just after six-week especially as you are roughly in just half of those stores, Bang is available and why you can't? So do you have any qualitative feedback at least from retailer in terms of sales especially in stores that sell Boost, Bang and Reign that you could share with us that would be helpful? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Well, we've got some information from some of our major convenience retail partners on SKUs \u2013 competitive SKUs. And they are trending by and large at a higher percentage than is shown in the Nielsen numbers. But because of the fact that we bought and it's not something that we generally go into and verify as carefully, we don't want to quote them on this call. But we do -- the numbers we are seeing out of the top change is showing a higher comparable number, which is positive for us and I think we just got to be a bit patient and wait for the numbers to start coming through generally. And then we'll start seeing the south point as well as the distribution overall. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. Any particular spend distribution of our product through the Coca-Cola Bottlers system international. We are also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attention and attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance.Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends.Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made during this call.Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2019, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 3, 2019 including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 7, 2019.A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products.In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada, as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018.Payroll costs increased $7.4 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018.Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the United States.Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter, compared to the net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter and increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has fully transitioned to Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke Bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay, and Saudi Arabia.We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the second quarter of 2019 in certain markets in Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria, and Cyprus. We are planning to launch prototype connected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019.I will now briefly discuss arbitration with the Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and the Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of where that Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell, or distribute energy drink products, it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand.On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final awarding in favor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome, Monster and Coca-Cola value the relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership.I've also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX\u2019s trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March, 2019, but proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May, 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million.Our sales of Reign [ph] for June and July was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations. As any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The Company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products.As our litigation with VPX is subjugated, we will not be answering questions on this matter on today's call. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year-ago.Sales of the Company\u2019s energy brands including Reign grew 5.6% in the 13-week period.

Our Company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the four weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points.Java Monster's share on its own for the four weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points. According to Nielsen, in the community and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 22, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars.

Amp and affordable energy brand launch in March increased its market share to 6.2% in June 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and also are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended July 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.2% to 12.7% in Belgium, from 22.1% to 27.4% in France, from 19.5% to 20.9% in Great Britain, and from 7.2% to 7.3% in the Netherlands, from 17.8% to 24.5% in Norway, and from 30.3% to 32.5% in Spain.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16% to 16.1% in Germany, from 11.2% to 14.3% in Poland, from 14.8% to 16.5% in South Africa, and from 12.6% to 12.8% in Sweden.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending May 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.6% to 13.4% in the Czech Republic, from 31.8% to 34.7% in Greece, from 14.6% to 17.8% in Ireland, and from 14.3% to 18.5% in Italy.According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.2% to 37.4% compared to the same period the previous year.

We launched Monster Energy in Argentina in mid-February 2018.According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 12% to 25.4% compared to the same period the previous year.

We again point out that in certain market statistics that cover single month may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2019 which includes Reign increased 9.6% from $929 million to $1.02 billion from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $22.1 million of foreign currency movements.A net sale for the Strategic Brands segment, which includes Predator, our affordable energy brand was $79.1 million for the second quarter as compared to $79.8 million in the same quarter in 2018.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $343.3 million or 31% of total net sales in the 2019 second quarter, compared to $293.8 million, which is 28.9% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $25.9 million.Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the Company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus previous quarters, but still continue to effect performance in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory.We are continuing to managing through and reduce these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are continuing to securing additional production capacity.In EMEA, net sales in the second quarter increased 10.9% in dollars and increased 21.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.5% compared to 43.8% in the same quarter in 2018.Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix, as well as increases in manufacturing costs. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 35.1% in dollars and 41.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.

Net sales in Chile decreased 2.4% in dollars, but increased 8% in local currency in the quarter.Our new product launches in the U.S. largely took place in the first quarter of 2019. We plan to launch a number of products in the United States later this year, namely Monster Mule, Reign Orange Creamsicle, Reign Strawberry Sublime and Reign Mango magic as well as Monster MAXX Mango magic and Monster MAXX Red-Red extra strength with zero sugar. As well as a new innovative Java Monster Line extension. The details of which will be revealed at a later date.We launched Monster Pacific Punch in May with the convenience chain customers as a first to market exclusive in Canada with a national launch in July 2019 and also launching Monster Mule later into 2019 in Canada. In Mexico, we launched Monster Mango Loco in April 2019. During the second quarter of 2019 we launched Monster Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rica. We also launched Predator in Trinidad in May 20, 2019.In the second quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in several countries across the EMEA. Monster Mango Loco is now available in 31 EMEA markets. We continue to launch different Monster Line extensions and our strategic brands in several countries across EMEA markets.Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in South Africa in the second quarter of 2019 and it will be launched in a further six markets in the second half of 2019.

We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year, including a full country launch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020.Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $358 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018.Net accounts receivable increased to $688.2 million at June 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018.Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018. We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was one more selling day in July 2019 than in July 2018.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 second quarter, no shares repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remained available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods.The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and note that Reign launched at Wal-Mart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India.We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the USA.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open. Caroline Levy : Thanks and good afternoon. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon. Caroline Levy : Just hoping you could give a little background on what you see happening in the performance energy category, whether you were doing the BOGOs in the second quarter and if those pull back. Just what the impact of Reign had on your business and whether you see any slowdown in BOGOs [ph] progress? Just anything you can talk about with that sort of disruptive area. Rodney Sacks : Well, obviously the performance category has had an impact on the overall energy category. And Reign has continued to perform up to our expectations. We are comfortable with the performance. It's a new product. It just got out and it's obviously going to find its feet in different markets and in different channels. The BOGO did not hit all at one time and some parts of the BOGO took place through the end of June, and I think 7/11 and there were some others that did bleed into July continuing.When we look at the BOGO, if you look at the average Reign sales on a weekly basis in Nielsen, it's been reasonably consistent over the past number of weeks. And so, we don't believe that the BOGO and the tailing off of the BOGO had a really marked influence on the sell rates. So we are comfortable with the ongoing sell rate of Reign. A lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves, getting shelves space. As we've launched it, we've had to create shelf space.In many cases, the products are not still worked into schematics, they are still being \u2013 schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue to, I think affect the performance of the performance energy category. Now, there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel such as Celsius and C4 and others.And so, we think that there will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category in the existing space or probably you will start seeing some additional space being allocated in C stores and coolers alongside or adjacent to the energy space.We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based drinks that will be lumped together. They will also take into account product, we think like Hydro and other performance energy drinks that just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks.And I think we should not meet the Walmart listing, which has really been a few good days now. And the team has done an incredible job of getting out and really stacking products that it will mind. So I think good things from that come as well. Hilton Schlosberg : But as with everything, it's timing, and so that only happened in the last few days as opposed to earlier in the year. So we do think that that will start having a positive impact again on Reign's sales and numbers. And we've also got good listings with Dollar General and a lot of other non-traditional retail stores for Reign. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Just to clarify, the July figure includes the selling to Walmart for Reign and can you help us quantify the benefits of Reign in acquiring both sales and the negative impact of the margin for the BOGO promotion? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : So, please remember that we don't sell to Walmart direct. It goes through the distributors. So, it's hard for us to extrapolate those numbers at this time for July. Those are regular July numbers that the distributors would order from us. Andrea Teixeira : But you can confirm that you started \u2013 that you've got the distribution at Walmart for Reign? Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. They anticipated the distribution for Walmart, but they knew it was going to happen. We knew it was going to happen. And they built up inventory according to their schedules to accommodate that listing, which is a big listing as you know. Rodney Sacks : Yes. Let's start it in the beginning of August. So obviously there would be some sales. Hilton Schlosberg : So listing\u2026 Rodney Sacks : Yes. The listing \u2013 there will be some. We don't know. Hilton Schlosberg : And then may be sales in June as well and we don't know. Rodney Sacks : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Vivien Azer : Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping to get your thoughts on what's happening with the core Monster brand and whether you've done any diagnosis around some of the pressure there. Is it primarily from Bang? Is it more from Reign and if it's the latter, how is cannibalization tracking relative to your expectations? Thank you very much. Rodney Sacks : Are you talking about the U.S. or internationally? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what you're referring to? Vivien Azer : The U.S. please. Rodney Sacks : Okay. The emergence of the performance energy sort of subcategory or subset within the energy category clearly has had an effect on sales of Monster generally, which is \u2013 as well as on the sales of other energy drinks that have really been in the market historically, which is Red Bull and Rockstar and others, even our other brands, NOS and Full Throttle.So there's been an effect on all of those brands. When you look at it on a stack basis, the Monster Energy category had a really good year in 2018. And so, you've got to look at it all over. There clearly has been an impact in this year, and in the second quarter.We are seeing some stabilizing of the other brands and \u2013 but overall, we look at the business on an overall basis and on an overall basis, the category is continuing to grow. We are still participating in an overall brands within the category are continuing to grow.And this is not too dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going to the market that you take a market like, Mexico for example, while they were in premium energy category, the shares, our shares were higher as an affordable energy brands got into that market. They grew the market overall and our sales grew continued to grow.Although our share of market if you take those affordable brands and then recategorize and market into a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise started to and did dropped and lower in Mexico while we've continued to see continued increases and positive sales in Mexico throughout the periods that the category has gone through this redefinition.And so that's where we think, we are all seeing the category in the U.S. and it will continue to grow and evolve. But overall, we obviously are looking to new innovation, we've got new innovation plan for later this year and next year and we do believe that we'll continue to have \u2013 Monster will continue to grow in the U.S. as well as the other products in our portfolio. Hilton Schlosberg : But U.S. has been some cannibalization on Monster. These being Reign is taking share from other brands as well and did as has Bang. So you look here, the category, the energy category, which includes both the traditional energy that we know, and the performance energy drinks and that together makes up the total energy drink category today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Rodney Sacks : Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan : Lots of questions, I guess just starting on the U.S., so I'm curious just the cadence of the quarter. We obviously see what month of April that it implies May, June we're up like 4% on an all-in basis. U.S. sales 6%, I guess sort of in line with scanner data, but if you exclude your commentary about Reign selling basically implies you didn't sell another product in the quarterSo maybe you give a bit more detail about \u2013 just what channel inventories look like, what shipments look like or whether some sort of issue in the quarter and shipping product from a retailer standpoint. And then completely different just what happened in international gross margins I heard what you said, but what specifically is going on there that's driving the overall continued weakness there. Hilton Schlosberg : So maybe I can start with the second question about gross margins internationally. So there were a number of reasons for the decline in international margins and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about on previous calls. So we said that our Monster energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage. They're not strategic brands which are largely sales of concentrate.So as international sales Monster grows at a faster pace, then the strategic brands overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted. Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs, which we spoke about on this call and Espresso Monster principally in EMEA which also have lower margins in our non-juice Monster SKUs. There's also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix is another factor; we sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving the whole shopping list.In the quarter ForEx negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries, particularly in LATAM that import finished products from the U.S. and from Mexico. This impact obviously was less when certain ingredients only are important not the finish goods. In certain overseas countries as you know, we operate different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that could and did have an impact in the quarter.Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be re reoccurring and frankly we are confident with the operating model. We've had a number of issues EMEA which we prefer to, we are getting to the end of those we believe, but we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs.So I hope that answered your question probably in more detail than you wanted. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottling system internationally.We're also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

We again to turn out to the quarter and we will move on from there. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace. And we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products.In the third quarter of 2019 net sales were $1.13 billion up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales for the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%.The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States in of our products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%.Turning now to gross profit, gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4%, compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases, as well as reduced input costs.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter.Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018.General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018.In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5%, compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and non-cash item were $16 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018.Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as the decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a non-recurring tax benefit.Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter, compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%.Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018.Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019 Monster Energy was launched by or transition to coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year.We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019.In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra Violet and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts.We continue to roll out a Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra Violet into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra\u2019s expansion into the fourth quarter, as well as commencing the launch Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India.I will now briefly discuss a litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing.In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX\u2019s most recent lawsuit.In October 2019, U.S. Court, the US District Court for the Southern District denied VPX\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction against Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In his decision, the Court ruled that VPX fail to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims.The VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own Reign -- own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster\u2019s trademark rights in this way.In one of the Court findings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June to December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations.As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products.As our litigation with VPX is subjugated, we will not be answering questions on this matter on today\u2019s call.Now we are going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.Sales of the company\u2019s energy brands including Reign grew 4.6% in a 13-week period.

Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 5.9% lower, while sales of Starbucks Energy were 18.1% higher.Our company share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks, Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the four weeks ended October 26, 2019, was 49.3% down 7points.

While Boost\u2019s sales decrease 3.5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 6.9%. Amp and affordable energy brand launched in March increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.Now I would turn to EMEA, I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be use as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2019, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period of previous year grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in the Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway, and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.So, now we are going to turn to sales and the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018.Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%.The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales with advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States by uncertain about products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movement net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%.Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment which includes Predator Affordable Energy brand was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018.

Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.Now, we turn to sales in EMEA, in EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved.

Short-term investments were $597.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019 from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018.Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.Now we can talk a little about October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales.The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period, often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribute incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.Share repurchase programs, during the 2019 third quarter the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.60 per share, for a total of $254.3 million excluding broker commissions.As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- US$36.6 million remains available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company\u2019s Board of Directors authorize a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company\u2019s outstanding common stock.In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and then Monster is generally going ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods.Number two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add the company\u2019s sales.Number three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year, as well as our innovation pipeline in 2024.Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad.Number five, we are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency, in Asia-Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51% in local currency. We reiterated the growth potential for us in China and India.And lastly, we are proceeding with our plans for future launches of Affordable Energy Drink brands internationally. We also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.I\u2019d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you all, and Rodney, I wish you a fast recovery. And so you can help us with the positioning of the core Monster, which I understand correct, if I understand correctly was down 2.4% in all outlets and declined 5% in convenience. Do you believe that is related to the promotional environment of your main competitor or just a function of Reign gaining more shelf space? And how are you planning to react to that? Will you feel the need for more promotion for to become more promotion as well or you are just happy with the total performance? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Well, I will take that. Forgive of my vocal. Just I think that if you look at the category, what we have noticed is you have had an impact on all of the -- pretty much on all of the SKUs that are had been existing in the market over the past couple of months. You are seeing the increases coming from us and our main competitor coming from new products.So -- but -- if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy. It\u2019s up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing. It\u2019s been a shift within the category. We -- you have got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we are down or some of the individually SKUs are down. But overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing, we would address obviously individual SKUs.And I think this is an experience that\u2019s being experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There is a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of that we have announced we recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps, didn\u2019t get enough shelf space or there have been some shelf space taken from our existing product, which I think has affected sales.So looking at one of the sort of main things I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting out innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we are looking for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line. Hilton Schlosberg : So just to add to what Rodney is saying, if you asked, if we are happy with the way things are, and obviously, we are not. We want to see the Monster brand growing. What we have evidence of is that the price increase has stuck. And when you will get our Q tomorrow and you can even see it, I think, in the release, that the promotional allowances are very much in line with where they should be and we are not over promoting.Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category if you look back 52 weeks, the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category and it\u2019s a category that now has a new segment, which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category.And, as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense, but as we look for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it\u2019s growing. The Red Bull core brands also not showing growth. The diet SKUs are and their additions are, but in general the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that, we have got plans with our distribution, which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers. Rodney Sacks : Perhaps there\u2019s just one other aspect I\u2019d like to add to that, this is sort of broad view. These comments we have made really focus on the U.S. and the US has been our major market. But as we develop as a company, the opportunity for us for our energy brands Monster in particular plus our other brands is international.And if you look at the information we just gave on this call about how we have accelerated international growth in existing international markets and new markets, that\u2019s where we look to in the future for the company.Our sales as we -- U.S. was about 72% of our sales last year this quarter and it\u2019s now down to 67. So if you take that with as a growth position, it\u2019s going to continue to grow. So we see a lot of run way to grow internationally, to grow the brand and these markets are continuing to grow and are very healthy.So, we need to address challenges we have in the U.S. at the moment. But, overall, we still believe in the health and we still believe in the growth of the brand both internationally and even in -- within the U.S. as well in our other energy brands. Hilton Schlosberg : And then one thing we really should -- turning back a few years for a moment, sorry. The one thing we really should not forget about is the unmeasured channels, which we have been absolutely emphatic about, our Food Service is unmeasured, Amazon is unmeasured, Costco is unmeasured, and a slew of other Home Depot and Lowes all of those channels are unmeasured. And the amount of sales that are going through those channels is really -- is a significant number. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Steve Powers : Yes. Thank you. Maybe a little bit more on the U.S. Can you talk about growth in the quarter coming in a touch below 3% versus the Nielsen data over the course of the quarter pointing closer to 6%? I think we all know you had tough comparisons in the year ago quarter, but at the same time, there was an extra selling day this quarter. And so just how do you think about that 3% number in light of those factors, building on Andrea\u2019s question? And then if I could related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, and I think, that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke energy and that they are targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk, but given that they will be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won\u2019t take away from some of your smaller SKU use whether Monster Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully fine incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So let me start with your first question. When you look at Nielsen and you look at our own financial numbers, you cannot draw an exact interpolation from one to the other. Nielsen sales out, our sales are sells to the distributors, the bottlers. We have a SKU of unmeasured channels that I mentioned. And while it\u2019s a good indication of what\u2019s of the movement of sales, it\u2019s not an absolute science and one has to be very wary, but we have said this on many calls in the past, I am going to be very careful trying to balance our sales to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer.Nielsen read a sample. They don\u2019t read all the channels. They don\u2019t read, as I said, the Food Service, they don\u2019t read Amazon, they don\u2019t read Costco. They don\u2019t read the Home Depot\u2019s and the Lowe\u2019s and all the other channels where our products are distributed. So it\u2019s difficult to draw a comparison from one to the other. All we can do is give you the facts and you guys make your own assessments from there. Rodney Sacks : Now as regards to Coke Energy. I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen well. They should be looking and analyzing Nielsen around the world and that would give everybody their own view on what\u2019s been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world.We have seen the brand rollout and we have also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales, the percentage market share has been small and hasn\u2019t really had an impact on us. The main impact that I think we will repeatedly said is that we did have concerns or is the sort of noise and in the market and focus from divergence of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down, our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued.And I think that by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing products and take pricing from us and it has worked reasonably well. There have been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we have addressed them.So, again, we don\u2019t know, we can\u2019t tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It\u2019s formulated little differently. It\u2019s a little different in sizes. There are two variants. But, ultimately, we think that, we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from to bottlers. Ultimately, we don\u2019t think it will have a major impact on our brand and we will manage it and going forward how you feel. Hilton Schlosberg : Yeah. I mean, what I would do if I were an analyst, I would get the information from the markets in which they have launched and there are a number of them. And frankly, they have not -- the numbers that I have seen and I can\u2019t talk for numbers that other people may have seen. The numbers that I have seen are showing that they have not performed particularly well and that our brands have continued to grow and our brands have continued to develop in those markets. But get the homework. Rodney Sacks : We don\u2019t know what the U.S. will be, it\u2019s own market. And so we will see how things go and we will manage it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And Tom, good to hear from you on the call today. Tom Kelly : Thank you, Mark. Mark Astrachan : There it is again. So, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margin. International continues to be a bit of a sore spot there. U.S. again continued to be pretty good. So you touched on some of the supply chain issues and EMEA having been resolved and kind of talking directionally to stabilization or at least that\u2019s maybe my interpretation of it. LatAm was obviously flat in gross margin. So is the worst behind you at this point. You have anymore visibility on that, I am not asking for guidance. I love a personal point of view, kind of how we should all think about that since I think it\u2019s one of those areas that is a bit more of a black box than others. So any help there would be a appreciate it? Hilton Schlosberg : It\u2019s not really a black box. I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands. And we sell finished products at different margins that really are a base for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production.So it\u2019s always every quarter the issue is how much do we sell internationally, which has low margins and I will get on to that, and I think, I have discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a cooperation versus finished goods at Monster Energy.So when we established a model in the United States, the distributors were allocated on margin, which was satisfactory to them and we had the lion\u2019s share of the margin. As we have grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottles in the Coke system where we have transitioned or launched with, they have demanded a highest share of the value chain.And this is something that we have had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally, that\u2019s going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business and the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this establish business with the same margins. We also have different costs impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can.And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have, and of course, the diet has the best margin of all.So, you have this issue of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products, we can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S. In fact in freight getting product and raw materials to our co-packers, that was big benefit -- the other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum.So there is a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It is not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And, as we have done in the U.S. and as we have done with freight in, we continue to look at our model internationally, and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I have always said, Mark, we sell products and we make gross profit dollars. We don\u2019t make gross profit percentages. Rodney Sacks : I think that the only thing I would like to add to that is -- very briefly is that, in the international market, there are a lot of markets that we have had to traditionally shipped into many markets, so many countries from other countries.We have -- and as we continue to expand and have sufficient volumes in countries, we are all switching to local production in those countries. We have opened up quite a number of additional production facilities in Europe this year and have got a number -- a large number going forward, and as we go forward, we think that will certainly help our margins internationally as well. But, at this point we just don\u2019t think there is any numbers we can point you to. Hilton Schlosberg : And also the community knows that we purchased REFILE, the concentrate facility from the Coca-Cola Company with the intention of producing ingredients in EMEA, which will reduce our improving efficiencies, improve costs and reduce the huge distances that we shipping these ingredients right now. Rodney Sacks : Yeah. We will also address some of the challenges we had last year and a little bit this year even in out of stocks and where we have increased demand for particular products, we had very long lead times in order to ship ingredients to pack us to try increased volumes this will obviously improve those efficiencies and will help us going forward. So that\u2019s been a -- we think we are very excited about the fact that that will help us in the whole of the EMEA and Middle East and Africa. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg for further remarks. Hilton Schlosberg : So thank you. You got my name right. We tested them before that, so well done on that. Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in what we are doing in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particularly expand distribution of our products to the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We always excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign and the new innovation plan for 2020. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.We are planning to leave some more time for questions on today's call and on subsequent calls. With that in mind, we will not repeat many of the numbers covered in our earnings release.Consumer Beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the fourth quarter of 2019 net sales were at $1.02 billion, up 10.1% from $924.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusting the 2018 fourth quarter for advanced purchases made following our November 1, 2018 cost increase in the U.S., as well as foreign currency movements. Net sales for the 2019 fourth quarter would have been up 7.5%.Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 fourth quarter increased 9.7% to $0.47 from $0.43 in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Sales of Red Bull increased 5.5%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.4%; sales of 5-Hour decreased 5.5% and sales of Amp decreased 37.2%. As there were no comparable sales of our Reign products last year, we have not referenced Reign.According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended January 25, 2020, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 5.7% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company\u2019s energy brands which include Reign grew 4.1% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

Sales of our Java Monster alone were 5.5% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 2.7% lower, while sales of Starbucks Energy were 15.2% higher.Our company share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Triple Shot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended January 25, 2020 was 52.6% down 4.9 points. Java Monster share on its own for the four weeks ended January 25, 2020 was 49.2%, down 0.4 of a point, while Starbucks Energy share was 45%, up 3.5 points.According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 4, 2020, the energy drink category increased 5% in dollars.

Amp and affordable energy brand launched in March 2019 increased its market share to 9.4% in the month of December 2019. Coca-Cola energy market share was 3.5% in the month of December 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2019 compared to December 2018, Monster\u2019s regional market share in value increased in Argentina from 16.9% to 33.5%; in Brazil from 19.6% to 27.4%, and in Chile from 34.9% to 39.8%.I\u2019d like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen, in the 13 week period ended January 55, 2020, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.7% to 12.8% in Belgium, from 24.8% to 28.2% in France, from 16.4% to 17% in Germany, from 20.3% to 21.9% in Great Britain, from 17.8% to 24.9% in Norway, from 31.7% to 34.5% in Spain, but declined from 7.3% to 6.1% in Netherlands and from 13.8% to 12.8% in Sweden.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended in December 2019, Monster\u2019s retail market share and value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.3% to 13.6% in the Czech Republic, from 33.6% to 34.7% in Greece, from 18.8% to 23% in the Republic of Ireland, from 18.1% to 20.6% in Italy, and from 10.9% to 14.5% in Poland and from 15.8% to 17.4% in South Africa.According to IRI in Australia, Monster\u2019s market share in value for the four weeks ended December 29, 2019, increased from 7.5% to 9.3% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother\u2019s market share in value decreased from 13.5% to 12.5% during the same period.According to IRI New Zealand, Monsters market share in value for the four weeks ended December 29, 2019 increased from 5.6% to 6.3% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live Plus market share in value decreased from 8.5% to 8.2% and Mother\u2019s market share in value increased from 7.8% to 9.6%.According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monsters market share in value in all outlets combined for the quarter ended December 2019 grew from 37.6% to 50.6% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster is now the leading energy brand by market share in value in all outlets in South Korea.According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster\u2019s market share and value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ended December 30, 2019 grew from 46.7% to 54.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $319.6 million, 31.4% of total net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter compared with $274.3 million or 29.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.1 million.Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.6% in dollars and it increased 12.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.7%, compared to 42.1% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix.We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Republic of Island, South Africa and Spain.In Asia-Pacific net sales in the fourth quarter increased 49.9% in dollars and 47.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.2% versus 46.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix.In Japan net sales in the quarter increased 84.2% in dollars and 76.8% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 51.5% in dollars and 58.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018.In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 4.1% in dollars and increased 0.8 of a percent in local currencies. Although I would like to point out that sales of the Monster brand increased 18.4% in dollars and 24.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018.In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 6.9% in dollars and 16.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.6% compared to 44.7% over the same period in 2018.In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 35.8% in dollars and increased 44% in local currency. Net sales in Chile decrease 14.8% in dollars and 7.6% in local current in the quarter.In January 2020 Monster Energy was launched by the Coco-Cola bottler in Israel. We continued the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Mango Loco in December. We also continued Ultra Violet\u2019s expansion from Septembers launch to further provide a broad portfolio with strong taste experiences for Indian consumers.The Monster range continues to build significant active distribution increases across China in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a year ago, but the situation in China is currently challenging. I wanted to provide an updated regarding the recent coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak.First of all, our number one priority is the safety of our employees in China. We are thinking of everyone who has been affected by coronavirus and we continue to monitor the situation closely. In addition to having employees in China, we and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients from third party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China. We also manufacture finished goods through third party bottlers and co-packers in China.The coronavirus outbreak could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions internationally due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third party manufacturers, as well as within China at our co-packing facilities and our china office. Ingredient sourcing delay could also interfere with, and would delay production of certain of our products internationally.In addition, the outbreak tougher with the accompanying special government measures could adversely affect the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products. However, it's too early to determine what impact it will have on our global supply chain and our operations. As I said before, our first priority is employee safety and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely.I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising. VPX filed a trademark lawsuit in March 2019 against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and another lawsuit in August 2019 against Monster alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. These proceeding are ongoing.In October 2019, the U.S. District Court denied VPX\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In his decision, the Court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims.In October 2019 VPX announced its intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. Later that month we filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster\u2019s trademark rights in this way.In November 2019 VPX stipulated that it would refrain from launching such products until the District Judge entered the final order on the preliminary injunction motion. In January 2020 the Magistrate Judge issued a report in recommendation that an injunction be drawn in Monster favor. Motions for some rejudgment had been filled by Monster in this proceeding and which are currently pending.In the event that some rejudgment is not granted, the matter is rescheduled for trial in May 2020. As our litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugated, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today\u2019s call.In October we launched Java Monster Farmers Oats, which contains Oatmilk is our first plant based coffee product being non-dairy and vegan, as well as two new flavors in the Reign brand family, Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic to supplement out Reign Orange Creamsicle line extension which was launched at the end of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter 2019 we also extended Ultra Paradise, Reign Melon Mania and Reign Razzle Berry in multipacks.In 2020 in the United States we will be discontinuing our Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line. We launched Reign Inferno\u2122 thermogenic fuel in Jalapeno Strawberry, Red Dragon and True Blue at the end of January 2020.We launched Mango Loco in Argentina during the fourth quarter of 2019. In Porto Rico in January 2020 we launched Reign Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic, as well as Muscle Monster, vanilla and chocolate.We launched Monster Energy, Monster Energy Absolutely Zero and Monster Energy Valentino Rossi in Israel in January 2020. Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Belgium, Great Britain, Northern Island, the Republic of Ireland in January 2020 and is planned to be launched in to a further seven markets in 2020.Monster Pipeline Punch will be launched in the Baltics in Norway this year and will then be available in 17 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Great Britain, Northern Island and the Republic of Island in January in 2020 and in Sweden in February in 2020 and is planned to be launched into a further 18 markets throughout 2020.Espresso Monster was launched in Belgium, the Republic of Island and Poland in the fourth quarter of 2019, in both milk and Vanilla variance. We also launched both variances in the Baltics, the Netherland and Portugal in January 2020 and in Austria in February 2020. Espresso Monster Milk and Vanilla variance are now available in 14 markets in the EMEA. We are planning to rollout two flavors of Espresso Monster in a further nine markets throughout 2020.Additionally, we have launched Espresso Monster Salted Caramel in Germany and Great Britain in December 2019. We are planning to rollout out Salted Caramel Espresso variance in the further five EMEA markets throughout 2020.Reign was launched in Great Britain, Northern Island and the Republic of Island in the fourth quarter of 2019, and we are planning to launch Reign in Germany by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch into a further seven markets throughout 2020.Monster HydroSport was launched to Germany, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2019 any in France in January 2020. We are planning to launch HydroSport in Norway and Sweden by the end of the first quarter of 2020.We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in Kenya and Uganda in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally we launched Predator in Poland in January 2020 and are planning to launch Predator in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, Ghana and Hungary in the first quarter of 2020.We are also planning to launch Predator into a further 11 EMEA markets throughout 2020; Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia, Croatia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Russia, Slovenia, Nigeria, the Netherlands and the UAE.We launched Mother Epic Swell in Australia during the fourth quarter of 2019, with a convenience customer before a national launch in January 2020. Monster Mule also launched in Australia in January 2020.In South Korea we further expanded Pipeline Punch to 90% of convenience stores with initial positive results. We launched Mango Loco in India during December and completed the Ultra White rolled out in India, Vietnam and Malaysia during the 2019 fourth quarter.We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full country relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in March 2020, and the Ultra Paradise in South Korea and Japan later this year.We estimate January 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.3% higher than in January 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 15.7% higher than comparable January 2019 gross sales. January 2020 had the same number of selling days than in January 2019.In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally going ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods.New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company\u2019s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year, as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020.We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and Reign Inferno\u2122 thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S., but also internationally.We are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA increased 12.8% in local currency, in Asia Pacific increased 47.9% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 16.2% in local currency.We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel, high performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the USA.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. Rodney Sacks : Hi Dara. Hilton Schlosberg : Hey Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Gross margins returned to year-over-year expansion in the quarter after fairly significant compression, generally in the last couple of years. So can you just tell us some of the key factors that drove that sequential year-over-year improvement in Q4, and if you think those factors are more sustainable as we look to 2020?And then just on the U.S. front, can you discuss your shelf space outlook, particularly with the Coke Energy launch and if you think you've seen any market impact from the Coke Energy launch so far. Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So maybe I can address the gross profit issues that you referred to. So if you look at worldwide, what the positive effect is worldwide \u2013 well obviously the price increase in U.S. and Canada and then product mix, particularly with Reign, which is an alternative gross margin for some of our juice and coffee products. We also had benefits in [Inaudible] because we were manufacturing our Java Monsters domestically and we weren\u2019t importing from the U.S. and aluminum and other raw materials were a positive factor, so that was the positives.Against that, we continued to have and you\u2019ll see the gross margins that we referred to on this call. Against that, you'll continually see a change in the strategic brands versus the Monster products and the strategic brands, because they are concentrates and they have higher margins than the finished goods product, so that you'll continue to see that as an offset.You'll continue to see geographic mix as an issue, because obviously in the U.S. our margins are strong. They are less strong in other parts of the world for all the reasons we've spoken to in the past and you'll see the same trend with regard to product mix as we sell internationally, as we sell more juice products and more coffee products, they have a lower margin than the traditional Monster products and Reign products. So that's in a nutshell where we are with margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you for taking my question. If you can comment on how the allowances in particular in Reign Inferno and how incremental it has been to your quarter-to-date update. And as a follow-up to your Coronavirus commentary, obviously safety is the most important at this point, but what is your view on the monitoring California and overall changes in mobility? Have you seen any greater impact in convenience stores so far against other channels? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Perhaps I\u2019ll just take the \u2013 Inferno has been really well received. In the initial you know it's very new to tell, but the sales have been good. The line extensions that we introduced into the Reign line, including particular Orange Creamsicle have also been well received. So the numbers are looking really positive for Orange Creamsicle and the other new products, as well as Reign. So anecdotally we\u2019ve had some good response, both to the concept of the thermogenic Inferno product, as well as to the actual flavors. Hilton Schlosberg : So Adex [ph] , if you look at for example what's happening in China, we are seeing obviously significant foot traffic decreasing in the biggest stores and the convenience stores, they have an all suffering, but not to the same degree.So if you translate that back to California, we haven't seen any implications yet, but you know the whole idea of this situation in China is that they limit the number of shoppers in particular stores. So that's why you'll see you know reduced foot traffic in the bigger stores and more concentrated foot traffic in the convenience stores. But we haven't seen any implications of that at this time.And then you know, if I could just talk about the Coronavirus for one second, I've been asked and I haven\u2019t really answered it, because I was waiting to answer it on the call and we don't normally give numbers, sales in various countries. But what I can tell you is that our sales in China in 2019 were less than 1% of our consolidated net sales for the company, so that puts a little bit in perspective, because there was a little bit of nervousness, but it's less than 1%. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Yes, hey thanks. So Hilton, last month in New York your acknowledged substantial \u2013 I think \u2013 you think you framed those issues of focus as coke bottlers were taken on Coke Energy and bringing it to the market in the U.S. I guess just some update there on how you're feeling about those bottlers execution on your brand's now that we\u2019re a couple of months into the year, but January numbers imply that you've had some good uptake of that innovation, but just any color around that and around the in-market execution that you're seeing would be great.And then just to give voice to a question Dara had asked, I think we might have lost sight of just any additional color on the cooler and shelf set redesigns as they are shaping up in the U.S. Are you getting the positioning that you thought you would? Is Coke Energy getting the position that you thought it would relative to yourselves and Red Bull and others, that too would be great? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay so, you know the situation without our bottlers is always going to be a challenge now and we know that and working with all of our bottlers and our field teams and our guards on the street are working very closely to ensure that we get the rock top of representation on shelves.The anecdotal information that I've seen is that Coca Cola Energy took off and unfortunately or fortunately there doesn't seem to be a very strong amount of repeat purchases. However, you know they will continue we believe to spend significant amounts of dollars on their products and what we have to do is what I'll probably said in New York and I\u2019ll say it gain, we have to still stay true to our last and ensure that our products get the right representation is the store, and that we don't suffer the issues of shelf space that for example we experienced in Australia, and we alluded to this in our presentation as well. But the news of today is that Coca Cola Energy has been \u2013 in its current form has been discontinued from the two major retailers in Australia. Hilton Schlosberg : If I could just perhaps just add a little bit on that, on color, we've looked at some of the schematics that have come out for this year. In the U.S., which is obviously the place Coke Energy has recently been launched and if you look at the schematics, for that plus obviously the performance energy products, by and large we are getting increased shelf price, both for our general products, as well as our Reign products and Inferno, including our innovation.And perhaps if you look back on \u201919, some of the innovation that we introduced didn't quite get the real estate and distribution levels that we had hoped for and that probably you know was \u2013 affected us a little bit in the 2019 year, but if you look at the new products, we have a really robust pipeline of new products.We have you know new Reign product, Inferno; we've got Ultra Fiesta and Ultra Rosa in the Ultra line that are two really good products; we have NOS Turbo, which is sort of a performance energy product to help boost the NOS line; we've got our new Hydro Sport SKUs; we have a new Java 300 line which has a higher caffeine content to compete with the Starbucks triple shot and I\u2019m looking at the SKU\u2019s and we\u2019re getting a lot of good listings for the innovation.So hopefully you know the execution of our bottlers and distribution partners this year, particularly on innovation will be better and we are getting extra innovative. In many cases we are getting the performance products on to an additional separate shelf. In some cases it's simply an expansion of and within the Energy set. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, good evening guys. Rodney Sacks : Good evening. Kevin Grundy : Two very quick ones; first one for Hilton. The G&A in the quarter, this one 's a bit granular, but I think it needs to be asked and sort of explained. Some of the profit margin pressure in the quarter, so gross margin better, but G&A was quite a bit higher, even excluding the intellectual property claim. Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers there and I know you don't like to guide, but should we expect sort of normalization on that line item looking out for the balance of the year.And then Hilton, just on the performance segment, understanding your comments are right in the shelf space reset, but can we get updated thoughts there. So Bang obviously made a lot of noise, but the market share on that product is down about a point sequentially from where it was around the time of the launch of Reign, and when we look at the combined market share of those two brands being Bang and Reign, it's kind of hanging around this 11% sort of area.So your updated thoughts on the outlook for performance for the balance of \u201820 and sort of beyond that; are we sort of at of place where this 11% market share is kind of the right number or you think it goes beyond that, and if so why? So thanks for all that guys. Rodney Sacks : Okay, well that\u2019s quite an amount. That\u2019s about 24 questions in one. If we talk a little bit about G&A, I think we were satisfied with the G&A that was spent in the quarter. You know we were running off the NASCAR program and we have a big push into social media and that was one of the big factors that we kind of were duplicating, some of the social media costs in the quarter as we roll off the NASCAR program. So you won\u2019t see that NASCAR program to the same degree in 2020.And then when I look at you know the rest of the G&A, payroll is obviously increasing higher than ordinarily we would like, but you know we\u2019re running an international business today that\u2019s growing and developing and you can see from the sales and the number of countries we\u2019re in, that we have to support the organization.So quite apart from you know other small issues which all \u2013 not small issues, but other issues which we\u2019ll pick up in the K, I don't want to go into them now. All I can tell you is that I think that apart from that litigation, which obviously we were very really unhappy about that it's you know the effect of doing business in the U.S. and I always tell everyone, I'm not a lawyer, but you know I listen to these juries and it\u2019s like \u2013 you know it is what it is. But I'm satisfied that our G&A is under control.So sorry, the next question you asked was about the percentage of the performance energy products in the U.S. and where that\u2026 [Cross Talk] Yeah, sorry. Kevin Grundy : Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. It was just basically broadly outlook for performance segment, which of course has made a lot of noise in the past year or two, but Bang\u2019s market share is now down about a point; Reign is 3, 3.5, it's in that range and when you look at the combined market share of those two brands, it's been sort of bouncing around this 11% sort of area. So where does that leave us? What\u2019s your outlook for performance energy and what\u2019s its role in the category going forward? Thank you guys? Hilton Schlosberg : I think Rodney put up his hands. So I'm happy for him to take over. Rodney Sacks : Alright, just looking at that section. I think this section, that\u2019s you know again, we call it the performance section, but really it\u2019s part of the energy category and it's really energy. It\u2019s a question of whether we can call that additional space with retailers to look at it, correcting you know increased bias into the categories.And so I think that you all \u2013 we all see some increased buyers coming into the category, and the set is sort of starting to settle down now. You're getting space allocated to banks, space allocated to Reign including Inferno. We are seeing a little bit of space being allocated to some of the competitors. You've got Rockstar with their sort of line and they\u2019ve come out with a thermogenic line as well and then you\u2019ve Adrenaline Shoc and then some of the smaller guys who are trying to get space, but don\u2019t have the distribution depth, CELSIUS and C4.But we think it is panning out. So it\u2019s sort of starting to settle down. It may grow a little bit, but we certainly don\u2019t know. We think that there is an appetite, there is an increased consumer base through the different type of products that we've introduced now for example though Inferno.But, we don't give as I said guidance, I think you know that, and we certainly don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But we think that there is some positive growth that will be achieved in energy generally and I think that this subset of types of products within the energy category will grow a little bit.We are launching for example HydroSport and that again is sort of an advanced hydration, but it does have BCAAs and higher caffeine. So a lot of products like that, Turbo, are starting to play into this area. It\u2019s just really dividing up the attributes that consumers are looking for. Some consumers are looking for higher caffeine or BCAs and we think that that will help the whole category grow, as well as these specific products within the category. Rodney Sacks : Yeah, I can just add to that it Kevin. I'm a consumer of these products and I honestly believe the category is here to stay. But where it will go, I don't think anybody knows. I think the main thing is that we have a number of SKUs that are addressing the category. We have some new product innovation that's coming in terms of the flavors and we are pretty excited about that whole performance energy part of the energy category, but its one part; there is lots of other parts to it as well. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Wow! That was a pronunciation. Hey guys, how are you? Rodney Sacks : Alright and you? Mark Astrachan : I am good, I'm good other than the stock market. So Hilton, I wanted to go back to gross margin, I know I seem to ask this question a lot on calls. But international in particular, I guess how should we think about that going forward? I\u2019m not asking guidance, but I guess it seems like the pressure on the strategic brands is having an outsized impact on that number.So as you go to the back half of \u201920, you start laughing at these low double digit declines that you had in 3Q and 4Q. You are obviously launching Predator now, I guess that\u2019s not \u2013 you are launching Predator now, it\u2019s a concentrate model, so that should help. How should we be thinking about kind of those moving parts, meaning as you lap easier comparisons you get the benefit from Predator. Should that help stabilize international gross margins? Can they move a little bit higher if Predator works in these markets. And maybe just a bit more color there in terms of puts and takes. I\u2019m thinking about international margins would be helpful. Hilton Schlosberg : Yeah, I think that as we look at the international business, we've spoken about the way the processing structure works in those markets, that we try and price ourselves close to where Red Bull is and that we have different models with the bottlers internationally that kind of force us into a different gross margin computation than we have in the U.S.Having said that, if I look for example at the EMEA margin, which we discussed earlier on the call, and the margins there fell from 42% to 38.7%, but there were a number of factors that went into \u2013 you know that went into that result. Firstly, and we\u2019ve spoken about this before, we have country mix, we have brand mix, we have product mix. So we have a very extensive project now to reduce the juice content in a number of our juice products to enhance margin.We have other projects \u2013 and I just came back from the UK about two weeks ago, where the whole meeting was just focused on margin, focused on freight-in, focused on co-packers, focused on where best to allocate our resources to try and improve the gross margins, and we have this concentrate and Monster Progression that of course will be resolved in part when we are able to get Predator up and running. So there were a number of factors and then you always have one-offs in the quarter. So in the fourth quarter we had about a 1% hit to gross margin in EMEA through one off costs.So you know I think we are very well aware from this office, of the need to improve margins and we are working on improving the margins within the constraints of the strategic brands having higher margins than the Monster brands and Reign brands. Obviously our objective is to sell more Monster and so more Reign and if that takes away from the strategic brands, then so be it, because you know this is a Monster Beverage Corporation. This is what \u2013 our mission is to sell Monster and Reign products.So if the strategy brands will in fact, over time they may get hit. We are doing the best we can to keep them at their current levels and improve on them. But you know it's a mix and it will continue to be a mix and I'm not sure there\u2019s anything more I can say. I probably said too much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.We are particularly excited about the new opportunities we have going forward, with the portfolio of energy drinks throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign and the pretty extensive new innovation that we have. It\u2019s recently introduced and are planning to continue to introduce throughout the rest of 2020. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is on the call as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement. Tom Kelly : Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends, as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company\u2019s business and operations.Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020, including the Sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which maybe mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 7, 2020. A copy of this information is also available on our Web site, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.I would now like to hand the call over the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the health of so many individuals around the globe, including some of our team members. This includes myself. In mid-March, I began to experience flu like symptoms, tested positive for COVID-19 and thankfully made a good recovery. I'm feeling good but for an occasional cough. For this, I'm very grateful. And we are fortunate that everyone at our company who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 is doing well and has been making good progress. The company has always operated with co-leaders. And I would like to thank Hilton and the leadership team for their leadership and support during this difficult period. To everyone at Monster, my sincere thanks and appreciation for all your efforts.From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well being of our employees. Early in March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work from home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers distributors around the world, who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities, our co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating.Certain of our bottlers distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but generally our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, which are smaller markets for us, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Since March 2020, while various markets have faced governmental measures, restrictions and guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales and merchandising activities of certain of our bottlers and distributors have been modified.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our net and gross sales for the 2020 first quarter was not material. The company's April sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, bottler and distributor sales of the company's product to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption.To-date, our sales in the second quarter have been adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel and food service on premise, while our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandise and grocery and related business remain stable. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy case our philanthropic arm is actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals, working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the National Guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have material impact on our liquidity. In the first quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.06 billion, up 12.3% from $946 million in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 first quarter would have been up 13.4%.Operating income was $365 million, up from $311.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in net income was 6.6%. The lower percentage increase in net income was primarily due to our higher effective tax rate in the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 first quarter increased 8.2% to $0.52 a share from $0.48 in the first quarter of 2019.According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2020, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandises, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, decreased by 1.2% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company\u2019s energy brands, including Reign were down 0.2% in the 13 week period. Sales of Monster were down 6.8%. Sales of NOS decreased 8.4%. And sales of Full Throttle decreased 12%. Sales of Red Bull decreased 1.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased 11.5%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 14.2%. And sales of Amp decreased 26.8%. VPX sales decreased 5.8%.Since Reign had just entered the market at the end of March last year, we have not provided comparable sales for our Reign products. According to Nielsen for the full week ended April 25, 2020, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars decreased 15.9% over the same period the previous year.

As a result, the Nielsen data is inaccurate and will not be covered on this call. We will resume reporting Nielsen data for Mexico once its data has been corrected. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2020 compared to March 2019, Monsters' retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 23.7% to 37.1%, in Brazil from 19.2% to 25.7% and in Chile, from 35.9% to 41.4%. I'd like to point out the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying base within the month referred to from country to country.According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended April 17, 2020, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 31.7% to 34.4% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions and/or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the U.S., was 356.8 million, 33.6% of total net sales in the 2020 first quarter compared to 284.1 million, which is 30% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 10.4 million in the 2020 first quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 26.3% in dollars and increased 28.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 43.2% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix. We\u2019re also plased that in the first quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Italy Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 32.8% in dollars and 33.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2019.Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sale was 42% versus 42.2% over the same period in 2019, as a result of country and product mix. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 61.7% in dollars and 60.1% in local currency.

Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 42.5% compared to 43.6% over the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 114.7% in dollars and increased 138.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chile, decreased 16.8% in dollars and 3.2% in local currency in the quarter. This was due to timing of shipments and our retail market share depletions remained strong.In the 2020 first quarter, we transitioned to Trinidad and Tobago to the Coca Cola bottler. In addition, we began production with our bottler in Trinidad, which will allow us to supply other islands and countries in this region on a tax efficient basis. In January 2020, Monster Energy was launched by the Coca Cola bottler in Israel.I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc, VPX the maker of Bang Energy drinks. A number of proceedings are currently ongoing to adjudicate claims, including claims for false advertising and trademark infringement, brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. These proceedings are ongoing. Our only update since our last earnings call is in relation to the lawsuit against VPX over its intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores.On May 1, 2020, a district court judge granted a preliminary injunction in joining the VPX from using the Reign mark in connection with any ready to drink beverage. A motion for summary judgment has been filed by Monster in this proceeding against all of VPX's claims in the suit, with a hearing on that motion set for later in May this year. In the event that summary judgment is not granted against all claims in the suit, the matter is scheduled for trial in August 2020. As with litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.We are working closely with our China team to follow the rules implemented by local authorities and we have reopened office in China. Monster shipments and distribution in the first quarter in China were negatively affected by the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in a volume decrease in the first quarter in China. But beginning in late March, early April, we have seen an increase in shipments and depletions.In April, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon Tea, which is non-carbonated and which has received early positive feedback. In addition, certain globally supplied ingredients are sourced from third party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China have recommended shipping to our network of copackers. During the 2020 first quarter in the United States, we launched a number of new exciting products, including a line of Reign Inferno, Thermogenic Fuel, two new energy drinks in the Monster Ultraline, a line of Java Monster 300 and a line of Monster Hydro Super Sport, as well as NOS Turbo.These launches were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we did not achieve planned distribution levels, in part due to certain retailers postponing implementation of their new plan schematics, which included our innovation products. We are developing plans with our bottlers and distributors to re-prioritize these recent innovation launches to ensure that we are able to maximize their distribution as soon as normalcy returns, particularly to the convenience and gas channel.In Canada, our Monster Energy portfolio was extended in January 2020 with the launch of Monster Ultra Paradise, Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, Monster Hydra Blue Ice, Monster Dragon Green Tea and Yerba Mate. We also added an additional flavor to our NOS energy lineup with NOS Sonic Sour.In Mexico, we launched Predator as our first entry in the country in the value segment. And in Brazil, we launched our non-carbonated Monster Energy Dragon Tea lemon tea during March 2020. In Australia, we launched Monster Energy Neo nationally and rolled up Mother Epics roll nationally in January off an exclusive with the select convenience and guest chain launch in the fourth quarter of 2019.Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Germany and the Netherlands in March 2020, and in France and Sweden in April 2020 and is now available in nine EMEA markets. And is planned to be launched into a further three markets in 2020. Black Monster Manga Logo was launched in Russia in March 2020. Manga Logo is now available in 34 EMEA markets. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Iceland, Malta and Norway in February 2020 and the Baltics, Denmark and Hungary in March 2020, and is now available in 20 markets across EMEA.Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Germany and the Netherlands in March and in Belgium, Italy and Norway in April and is now available in eight EMEA markets. We are planning to launch Ultra Paradise into further 14 markets in 2020 in EMEA. Espresso Monster was launched in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Switzerland in March 2020, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in April 2020, in both milk and vanilla variants. Espresso Monster milk and vanilla variants are now available in 20 markets in EMEA.We are planning to launch two flavors of Espresso Monster into further two markets in 2020. Additionally, we launched Espresso Monster Salted Caramel in Norway in February 2020 and in Sweden in April 2020. We are planning to launch this product in the further three EMEA markets in 2020. Reign was launched in Germany in February 2020 and in Spain in April 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Reign into a further six markets in 2020.Once the HydroSport was launched in Norway and Sweden in February 2020, and we are planning to launch Monster HydroSport in Spain late in the second quarter. Burn Dark Energy, our new citrus burn variant was launched in Russia in March 2020. Two SKUs of the new Nalu Energy tea line, green tea and ginger and black tea and passionfruit, were launched in Belgium in April 2020.We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the Czech Republic and Hungry in February 2020, Afghanistan and North Macedonia in March 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Predator in Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria in the second quarter of 2020. We're also planning to launch predator into a further five EMEA markets later in 2020, Bosnia, Croatia, Romania, Russia and Slovenia.Similar to the United States in a number of markets, our recent new product launches were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are implementing plans to re-prioritize certain launches. In Japan, we successful relaunched Pipeline Punch with strong results that builds our number one country share positioning value. In South Korea, we further expanded Pipeline Punch to 90% of convenience stores with positive results that also took Monster to a number one share position in value.The Monster portfolio grew strongly in both countries. We are planning to launch Ultra Paradise in both Japan and South Korea later this year. India followed up on the December 2019 Mango Loco launch and extended distribution nationally early in the first quarter before a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25, 2020. We estimate April 2020 gross sales to be approximately 22.2% lower than in April 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, April 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 20.8% lower than comparable April 2019 gross sales. However, bottler and distributor sales of the company's products to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted.April 2020 has the same number of selling days as April 2019. April sales were materially and adversely impacted by the COVID pandemic to deferring degrees from country to country. We're optimistic for improvement once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Indeed, a number of U. S. states have recently begun to partially reopen and certain countries internationally are starting to do likewise. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they also unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales average for periods, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points; one, the company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees, customers, consumers and our communities; two, currently the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its copackers, warehouses and shipping facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating; three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio; four, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but also internationally; five we are pleased with our growth and performance, both domestically and internationally during the first quarter. We reiterate the growth potential for us in India when the country reopens as well as in China; six, we are proceeding with planning for future launches of our affordable energy brands, as well as Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.; seven this year in light of the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual meeting on June 3, 2020 exclusively as a virtual meeting via live webcast.You will not be able to attend the annual meeting in person but during the virtual meeting, you may ask questions and we'll be able to vote your shares electronically. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions, can be found in the company's proxy statement. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. And Rodney, I'm glad to hear you\u2019re well and wish you good health to all on this call. So how much has traditional channels and convenience and gas impacted the 20.8% FX neutral decline globally in April? And if we can break down the U.S., I guess we\u2019ll appreciate the figure you gave, saying that U.S. was largely impacted. It will be helpful for investors to figure out when the timing of COVID passes. And then the other thing I would like to clarify on the e-commerce performance. How much -- you gave and we appreciate that. How much would that represent now as a percentage of total sales? Thank you very much. Rodney Sacks : Okay, Andrea, good afternoon. Maybe I should deal with that question. So what we saw in April was a decline in sales, which we indicated. If you look at the Nielsen for all major channels, we on these calls traditionally give the Nielsen for convenience. But if you look at the Nielsen for all major channels that show the decline of 10.2%. Not only do we measure shipments, we also measure depletions. And depletions are the sales that the bottlers and distributors sell to the various retailers.Depletion were largely in line with the Nielsen numbers for all major channels. In fact, they were a little bit better. So I think what you\u2019ve seen and I'm only talking to U.S. and I'll talk about EMEA, which is our next biggest market in a while. So in the U.S., what we saw was, I believe and the numbers appear to verify that there was a reduction in inventories in the bottler network, because shipments declined much faster than depletions and in fact the Nielsen numbers. So that's where we are in the U.S. with our bottler and distributor business.With our direct business, we have some direct business, the clubs, e-commerce, et cetera that business was largely intact. So we didn't see declines in that part of the business. Also, what happened in April is that there was a lot of stock building and pantry loading that seem to culminate in the last week in March. And in April and if you look at April sales week by week, our sales have improved week by week. And that's also true in EMEA, which is our next biggest market. So in EMEA, they didn't see the same degree of stock reduction by the bottles distributors. But what we have seen in the EMEA, as the countries have opened sequentially better performance week on week.For the rest of business, Asia Pacific was up on last year marginally and LATAM -- well, I should say margin was actually it was up to a nice degree over last year and LATAM was in line with last year. So that's the issue from the U.S. and from EMEA, and I hope that answered your question.So regarding the second question and you kind of not -- out one question, but on the second question about e-commerce. We don't disclose those numbers. The numbers are available on stat line. We don't disclose those numbers. The debt market is becoming a very big market for us. And you could see from the indication on the call that our market share with Amazon is growing pretty significantly. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Hey, afternoon, everybody. First of all, by the way, I'm making dinner for the kids while listening. So you guys are very fortunate. I guess I just wanted to talk a bit about some of the cost controls that seem to have occurred in the quarter. Maybe talk a bit about how to think about selling and G&A expenses. In terms of with some of shift response to what you've seen in the quarter and some of this because you didn't have NASCAR recurring and selling expenses, while G&A up a little bit less than we've seen. And I know you don't want to give guidance, but any sort of direction that you can give us in terms of how to think about those numbers for 2020 that would be helpful. Thanks. Rodney Sacks : So as we look at the year, particularly with sponsorships and endorsement. Yes, NASCAR has fallen away and we have other sponsorships and endorsements that may not cost the same this year as they did last year, because a number of events have been canceled. So we don't give guidance. But I think as one reflects on the year, we can see a change in pattern in our spending. We've been spending a lot more on social media, which we believe is very important, particularly in this market that we're in. And we'll continue to spend in the markets as we deem appropriate. Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : I guess Rodney, as you mentioned, some of the states are starting to reopen. What have you seen kind of from the core Monster consumer in a more restrictive states in New York or California where we're expecting kind of manufacturing and construction to come back online sooner. That I would think will also kind of play more in your core consumer. Just anything you're hearing on the ground as they start to reopen more. Thanks. Rodney Sacks : I think that that's drilling down to a level that I don't think is appropriate. And I don't think it's something we should be doing, because there are so many variances from state to state and so many factors. I think you've got to look at it on a broader basis across the U.S. and also across the world, because you look at individual countries. And we're really not in a position to have analyse each and every country and giving you percentage up or the percentage back to normal. I think it's just more anecdotal of a trend that we are seeing, and it's starting to open. And we just say, we feel that when you look at the weekly numbers, Hilton referred to earlier, you can see that there seems to be a trend that those numbers are improving on a weekly basis. Operator : Thank you. Next question will come from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Laurent Grandet : Good morning, everyone. And Rodney I\u2019m very glad to hear that you\u2019re recovering from COVID, so keep safe. So, I like to question you about the renewed competition in the space. And Pepsico in the quarter became a much stronger competitor with, first the acquisition of Rockstar, and that's with the announcement of distribution agreements with them in the U.S. Any comments on the move and how you are planning to adjust maybe to this new landscape. And also mean, should that change the way you and the Coca-Cola company and its populous partner? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Well, I think it's difficult to comment on Coca Cola, because we've always maintained a good relationship with the Coca-Cola company even during the arbitration proceedings that we had. We know that transitions generally are very disruptive. We've been through a number and we know how disruptive they can be. So that's we believe in a short term is an opportunity for us. In the long term, it's difficult to comment, because Pepsi Cola has never really had success in the energy category historically, although, they now have brands that are a lot more powerful than they had before.Rockstar has declined 50% since the market share, since the distribution agreement began in 2009. So it's really difficult to say. I think that the short term will be disruptive and we've got plans, both for the short term and for the long term. And I think it will be inappropriate for us to disclose what those plans are. But rest assured we do have plans and we believe we've got very strong brands and that we\u2019ve got good marketing prowess and that that advantage will prevail in the long term. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Bill Chappell : Just following up on the -- and glad to hear you're doing well Rodney. Just following up on the Pepsi side, less from what you were seeing, be it from Rockstar or Bang, because I think you've kind of already seen that. Are you expecting anything new out of Mountain Dew or seeing anything from that front? Now that it seems that Pepsi is a little more unleashed and what it can do on the energy sector? Hilton Schlosberg : Well, we haven't seen anything yet. But we are anticipating that yes, that reporting in the press that they were kind of hamstrung with utilizing the word energy on some of the other brands. And we believe that that\u2019s something that will happen in time but honestly, we shouldn't conjecture on what they may or may not do. Rodney Sacks : Yes, I\u2019d just like to add that a lot of these things are not new. They have endeavour to play in that space through Kickstart and in the Mountain Dew range, and -- as an extension. And so there will be a little bit of a divergence, tweak to that. They have already been building on what Hilton said, they've been distributing Rockstar for the last 10 years. So at the end of the day, I don't think there's going to be much change. But again, we can't speculate to whatever they will put behind and for how long. But we do think that the Rockstar brand has some challenges, and we think that we're in a strong position to address that. And to address the the Bang position, I think that you've seen the market shares of Bang over the past 12 months. And we think we're in a good position to continue to compete with them, regardless of the distribution system change. There are benefits but there are also some negatives in that that come with that change. Hilton Schlosberg : So the one thing I would add, actually, to what we've all just said, is that this results with Pepsico, I think will galvanize us, Coca-Cola and a whole bottling system against the common enemy. And I think that's a very positive factor as well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. And hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not too distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : And thank you, sir. The conference has not concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead sir. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is on the call as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary announcement. Tom Kelly : Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends, as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 11, 2020, including the Sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which maybe mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 4, 2020. A copy of this information is also available on our Web site, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well being of our employees. As mentioned on our previous call in early March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work from home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Our offices have partially reopened in the United States and in certain countries and our field sales teams are operating in the field with our bottlers, distributors and retailers subject to safety protocols. We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers and distributors around the world who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities are co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of our bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their coal points and service levels. But generally our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our net and gross sales for the 2020 second quarter, in part due to certain of our bottlers and distributors, reducing their inventory levels. However, we did see a sequential improvement in sales in the latter half of the quarter, as certain countries and states began to gradually reopen. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption. Our sales in the second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Our ecommerce, clubs store, mass merchandiser, and grocery and related business continue to increase in the quarter while our food service on-premise business which is a small channel for us remains challenged. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm continues to be actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the National Guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. In the second quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.09 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements in itself for the 2020 second quarter would have been up approximately 1%. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact was more pronounced in EMEA during the quarter. In particular, the reduction in revenue from our strategic brands segment was significant as our larger revenue generating countries in EMEA experienced extended lockdowns. Operating income was 407.3 million, up from 379 million in the second quarter of 2019, due in part to lower sponsorship and endorsement costs of 19.8 million, as well as lower travel and entertainment expenses of 10.1 million. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or maybe deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate in which future periods if any such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. Net income increased 6.5% to 311.4 million as compared to 292.5 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 second quarter increased 9.9% to $0.59 from $0.53 in the second quarter of 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 18 2020, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 7.6% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 18, 2020, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 10.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java monster were 24.6% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks energy were 12.3% higher. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy category which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Double Shot and Triple Shot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended July 18, 2020 was 51.1% up 5.9 points while Starbucks energy share was 47% up point 8 points. Cafe Monster and Espresso Monster have been discontinued in the United States. According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon in the United States for the four week period ending July 18, 2020, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots increased 190% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Monster increased 269.4% and its share was 39.5% up 8.5 share points versus the same period a year ago. Red Bull sales increased 172.4% and its share was 14.5% down 0.9 of a point.

According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category declined 11.8% for the month of June 2020. Monster sales decreased 18.9%. Our market share in value decreased 2.4 points to 27.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Burn has been discontinued in Mexico; Red Bull sales decreased 30.3% and its market share decreased by 1.8 points to 6.8%. The Vive 100 sales decreased 32.6% and its market share decreased by 7 points to 22.5%. Volts sales increased 0.2 of a percent and its market share increased 2.2 share points to 18.8%. While Boost sales decreased 10.7% and its market share increased 0.1 of point to 7.4%. [Indiscernible] sales increased 269% and its market share increased 7.5 points to 13.6. Coca-Cola energy's market share was 0.9 of a percentage point. Predator which was launched in March 2020 achieved a market share of 1.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, subjectivities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2020, compared to June 2019. Monsters retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 25.4% to 39.4%; in Brazil from 21.1% to 30.4%; and in Chile from 37.4% to 44.9%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster is now the leading energy brand in volume in Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended mid-June 2020. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 22.1% to 25.6% in Denmark; grew from 20.8% to 24.8% in Great Britain; grew from 24.2% to 28.4% in Norway; grew from 21.9% to 24.9% in the Republic of Ireland; grew from 32.2% to 34.8% in Spain; and grew from 12.8% to 13.8% in Sweden, but declined from 13.1% to 12.5% in Belgium; from 27% to 25.9% in France; and from 7.4% to 6.3% in the Netherlands. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of May 2020, Monster's retail market sharing value is compared to the same period the previous year grew from 34.7% to 35.2% increase, from 13.7% to 17.7% in Poland, from 16.4% to 17.7% in South Africa, while it remained flat at 13.3% in the Czech Republic, and declined from 16% to 15.1% in Germany and from 18.5% to 16.8% in Italy. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channel is read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market chain value for the four weeks ended July 5, 2020 increased from 9.4% to 11.9%. As compared to the same period the previous year, Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.9% to 13.3% during the same period. Market share of the company brands in Australia for the four weeks ended July 5, 2020, increased from 23.3% to 25.2%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended June 21, 2020 increased from 7.8% to 10.4%. As compared to the same period the previous year, Live+ market share in value decreased from 8.3% to 7.1%. And Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.5% to 6.4%. Market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended June 21, 2020 increased from 22.6% to 23.8%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the month ending June 2020 grew from 39.4% to 53.3% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of June 2020 declined from 52.5% to 51.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were 328.3 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2020 second quarter, compared to 343.3 million or 31.1% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. The decrease was largely due to the reduction of sales in EMEA during the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 18.2 2 million in the 2020 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the second quarter decreased 20.4% in dollars and decreased 15.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.1% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was adversely impacted by foreign exchange rates, country and product mix. In local currencies gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.4%. The COVID-19 pandemics adverse impact on net sales was more pronounced in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020 particularly in the strategic brands segment. Net sales in EMEA will also adversely impacted by the reduction in inventories by certain of our bottlers and distributors. In addition, to a lesser extent, the trading dispute between Coca-Cola bottlers and the European buying group primarily in Western Europe resulted in the temporary delisting of some Coca-Cola and Monster products, which had an adverse impact on itself in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020. We are pleased that in the second quarter Monster gained market share in Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 30.4% in dollars and 30.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.3% versus 43.6% over the same period in 2019. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 41.8% in dollars and 37.5% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 46.9% in dollars and 55.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China net sales increased 66.9% in dollars in the quarter and 74.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 32.3% in dollars and 24.9% in local currencies, sales of the Monster brand decreased 25.6% in dollars and 17.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019, while the strategic brands in this region decreased at a faster rate. Net sales in this region were adversely affected as a result of our bottlers' distributors, reducing their inventory levels in Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean. Net sales in the second quarter decreased 9.7% in dollars and increased 10.8% in local currencies. Gross profit of the same period in 2019, gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41.2% compared to 43.3% of the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter decreased by 1% in dollars, but increased 31.2% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 30.8% in dollars and 62.3% in local currency in the quarter. I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, VPX the maker of Bang energy drinks. Several proceedings are currently ongoing with VPX, including claims for false advertising and trademark and trade dress infringement, brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. The company's lawsuit for unfair competition, false advertising and misappropriation of trade secrets, is scheduled for trial in April 2021. VPX's lawsuit against the company which VPX claims trademark infringement of the newly acquired Reign trademark and the company counter-claimed for cancellation of their trademark. The district court judge ruled in the company's favor in respect of the trademark infringement claims, finding that the company had superior rights to the Reign trademark in connection with energy drinks and cancelling the Reign trademark that VPX had purchased. VPX remains [indiscernible] from selling Reign branded energy drinks, VPX's trade dress infringement claims in these proceedings are scheduled for trial at the end of August 2020. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, our bottlers focused on relaunching our first quarter product innovation, which launch plans, were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Canada, we did not launch any new items within the second quarter of 2020 and continue to grow our distribution of all first quarter 2020 innovations. In Honduras, we launched Fury, Gold Strike in the affordable energy category during April 2020 and in Salvador in early July 2020, initial results have been positive. In June 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Argentina and Puerto Rico. Additionally, in June 2020, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. In New Zealand, we launched Monster Energy Mule and Mother Tropical Blast during April 2020. Despite a lockdown in majority of EMEA markets for most of the second quarter, we have still been able to introduce new products across EMEA. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Spain in June 2020 and is now available in 10 markets across EMEA and we plan to launch Juice Monster Pacific Punch in an additional two markets in 2020. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Romania in May 2020 and is now available in 21 markets across EMEA and we plan to launch Juice Monster Pipeline Punch in an additional eight markets in 2020. Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Switzerland in June 2020 and is now available in 35 markets across EMEA. We plan to launch Juice Monster Mango Loco in an additional 10 markets in 2020. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Austria, the Baltics and Hungary in May 2020, in Denmark and Spain in June 2020, in Poland in July 2020, and is now available in 14 EMEA markets and we plan to launch Monster Ultra Paradise in an additional seven markets in 2020. Espresso Monster Milk and Vanilla variants are now available in 20 markets in EMEA and we plan to launch Espresso Monster Milk and Vanilla variants in an additional two markets in 2020. Monster Hydra Sport was launched in Spain in May 2020 and we plan to launch Monster Hydra Sport in an additional market in 2020. We are also pleased with the performance of Reign and we plan to launch Reign in an additional six markets in 2020. We launched Monster Mule in Poland in July 20 and plan to launch Monster Mule in an additional nine markets in 2020. We launched Predator a primary affordable energy brand in Nigeria in June 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Predator in Ethiopia in the third quarter of 2020. We are also planning to launch Predator in an additional six EMEA markets later in 2020, Bosnia, Croatia, Ghana, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. Currently innovation launches for all EMEA markets for the third and fourth quarters remain on track, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, these launches will continue to be subject to developments in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in individual countries. In Japan, we continued with the strong rollout of Pipeline Punch to 90% of the country, and in June launched Ultra Paradise with solid consumer acceptance. With strong innovation and continued growth of our core, we have further bolt-on our number one country share position in value. In South Korea, Monster Energy retained its Number 1 share position in value and in June began shipments for the summer 2020 launch of Ultra Paradise. In April 2020, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon tea in China, which is non-carbonated. Early feedback from consumers has been positive. During this quarter we began shipments for our summer on pack promotion and we expect to further build momentum with consumers in the retail trade. India remains mostly in national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25 2020. We have prepared a strong summer on pack promotion, which will help reestablish momentum as the market aims to reopen in the third quarter of 2020. During the 2020 second quarter, we purchased approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of 52.88 per share, for a total amount of 15.6 million excluding broker commissions. As of August 4, 2020, approximately 441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate July 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.8% higher than in July 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2020, gross sales would have been approximately 17.1% higher than comparable July 2019 gross sales. July 2020 had the same number of selling days as July 2019. In this regard, we cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they also unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify, the negative impact on ourselves including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees. Two, currently the company's flavor manufacturing facility, its co-packers, warehouses and shipping facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. Three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. Four, we're encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks. We are planning for future launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the US. Five, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands outside of the United States. Six, despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Congrats on the results. So I remember you spoke to potentially answer the alcoholic segment, the last time we were there at your headquarters in June last year. And since then, we have heard you're planning to launch a Hard Seltzer. So I understand that you have postponed some of these launches. So the question is, if you are indeed looking to launch a Hard Seltzer and then if so, when are you hoping to be able to share more news with us. Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Andrea, I think the issue is -- there's been a lot of speculation about what we are going to do both in the non-alcoholic and alcoholic spaces. We are looking at a number of alternatives and opportunities. And we may well do something in both of those spaces and/or one or the other. But we've not had made any final decisions. We are actually, you analyzing it, we were looking at developing some products in both non-alcoholic and alcoholic spaces, we are testing products. But we haven't yet decided on which of those we're going to go into. We have for example, I know that some of the analysts have picked up that we register different names of products, some of those names may be appropriate for one or more of these lines or may not be we are looking obviously as part of our planning, we are looking at availability of names that we think may be appropriate for lines or line extensions outside of the energy category. And in some cases, some of those names may well be used by us for an alternative brand within the energy space. I mean, it's a very broad spectrum that we are currently investigating. We've got the right to do quite a lot. We are looking at how do we do it? What's best, what do we think will have the most impact for the company in the short-term, both in the U.S. and as well as internationally? So, there's been a lot of speculation, and we are definitely looking at it and evaluating it, but we've not made any decision. So at this point, it is premature for us to give any indication to the market of what our plans are because we have not firmed up our plans internally ourselves yet. There's been no definitive decision on when to launch, what to launch and under what brand names. Obviously, we're getting there. We're quite close, but we haven't gotten to that position, yet. So I really can't give you an update other than to tell you that we are seriously looking at all those options. As we, as I said, there's a lot of speculation about what we're going to do because of the names and the trademarks we've applied to register under different clauses, but that is something that we are currently evaluating. Hilton Schlosberg : So Andrea, the only thing I would add to that is that we have a very strong innovation pipeline with our existing business. So whatever we do, in addition to that, please rest assured that the company has a very interesting and very strong innovation pipeline. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : So I guess kind of one and a half question. One question is on innovation. Just given how the resets have been kind of thrown off [indiscernible] and just inactive now cancelled. I'm just curious on how you're thinking about communicating new product ideas and how you think that flow will work as we kind of work into the fall and into the spring of next year. So that's just kind of some general perspective. The real question is on CBD, what's the company's stance right now on that? I mean, is it -- you don't have enough clarity, so really don't want to enter that category? Or do you feel more comfortable now? I mean just any perspective around that would be helpful. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So on the first question, we have a sales organization who in the U.S. call on every single major customer and that's how we go about presenting new product ideas on a one-to-one basis. So rest assured that innovation can be handled within the framework of our existing organization. Outside in particular, in Europe and in other parts of the world, the Coca-Cola bottle is present to customers with our attendance and they're very capable and they do display new products and new product innovations. On your second point, the environment is actually not clear as to where we are and where we should be with CBD. So at this time, we have products in development, but it's something that we're looking at from the sidelines and if things clear up and the opportunities that will present themselves that's something that we definitely will look at going forward, but not right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Just wanted to ask you on the July sales increase, Rodney, you mentioned that bottlers had taken down inventory pretty low in the second quarter just, how should we look at that July increase, I guess from an organic demand, improvement standpoint versus bottlers maybe refilling some of the pipeline after getting inventory down to low? Thanks. Rodney Sacks : I don't think we've really had a good read yet on where the bottlers -- when they're going to sort of get their inventory levels back to previous or pre-COVID levels. If they do, I mean, people are obviously looking at managing their inventory levels as tightly as they can and by taking things down. They may end up being a little more aggressive; obviously, we would like them to take some inventory levels up so that they just have more ability to react in the market and because of the lead time reasons. I don't think that we've seen a major restocking in July. We've just, again, I think people are still cautious and they're trying to manage inventories and in some cases, they're trying to manage or reduce some of the focus on -- better way to put it on their main SKUs. And so some of the smaller SKUs have perhaps suffered a little bit as well during this period, but we think those things will get back to normalizing. But I don't believe we've seen a substantial jump back in inventory levels in July. I think that sort of reasonably normal trading for us and Hilton, if you'd like to add something on that. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. What I'd like to add is that, depletions are tracking positive through July. So sales that are bottlers make to retailers are tracking positively and sure there will come a time when bottlers will revert to the prior inventories. But remember, they look at for us. Some bottlers have cash issues, the bigger bottlers look at sales forecasts that are generated both by their own forecasts and by the computer forecasting models. So they order inventories in accordance with those models. So, you remember when we spoke about on the last call, we spoke -- April was down. And we had a long and a robust discussion about that and we spoke about the patients. And looking at this quarter, we've had a strong July, which is consistent with what's happened in the sequential improvement through May. So April, we had that dip that we spoke about on our call. And in May and June, we've had a sequential improvement and we've seen that sequential improvement through July as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : I guess I'm curious on U.S. I don't know how to diplomatically ask the question but maybe, if you could touch on the engagement of the coke system both in terms of selling your legacy product and the new product innovation including the shelf space for those obviously it was a little bit of a slower start. And we've seen Red Bull do very well. So maybe just touch on kind of where we are with reengagement both in legacy as well as innovation and how you think that should play out if things get back from blocking and tackling standpoint, if the share trends potentially improve and you kind of how you think about that? Hilton Schlosberg : So Mark, remember we coming out of 100-year pandemic. And there's been -- the bottlers have all been operating and in some cases, the bottlers have been focused on sending the faster sending items, I think Rodney mentioned that earlier in the call. And they did not focus on the innovation and the SKUs that not move as fast as the faster sending items. So, we've seen that. We've seen some of the bottlers being affected by the employees by COVID; our people remember who are out of the field until the last month so they now are back in the field with the appropriate safety protocols. And our people are working; our field people are working with the bottlers and the retailers to restore the innovation that had not been taken place. So, Red Bull, it's interesting -- we've been watching the growth of Red Bull as well. And, once it's paying, you've seen the numbers and we've spoken about the numbers today. I've heard about the numbers in Nielsen. We are growing much faster than Red Bull in for example, Amazon. They have their own sales force and the distribution network. They've been able to execute pretty well in the trade they had a really good innovation the CEO called watermelon, which is pretty popular. So, in balance I think they probably distributed us in terms of displays and other points of purchase on store shelves and on the floors of the stores. And that's something that we are working to pretty aggressively without fuel people back in the stores to regain. So that's my kind of summary on where we are and the issue with Red Bull. Rodney Sacks : Perhaps I could just, again also just have a little bit of color too, because I think it's obviously, you're focused on it and some people have been seeing the numbers. I think it comes down to during this period of time; Red Bull really managed their own distribution system. And they have dedicated and very focused personnel. I think when most of the big companies took a step back, particularly with their personnel in the field and their core points and being active in the market in the smaller markets, convenience and gas, et cetera and independent. I think all the bigger companies took their foot off the pedal and looked at protecting their employees and trying to handle the situation. I'll believe is that Red Bull literally was probably the only company that didn't do that and actually had their teams in the field, merchandising and promoting. And when you combine that focus together and they adjust their approach to the COVID pandemic, as well as together with the fact that they did have a flavor that resonated and it was really well executed the introduction of it, and it has really given them that boost. That's really what we think has been the real difference. But those are things that with a bigger company, like the Coke system where I think they just step back as most other consumer product companies did. I think that will start reversing and that they are getting back into the field. Now we're getting out into the field. We also pulled some of our team out as Hilton said. We've got a really understand that and that's what I think has been one of the big reasons. We've got some innovation lined up for the second half of this year, including something in response to the watermelon product and we will be launching that within the next few weeks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Laurent Grandet : So last time we spoke I mean, you mentioned that because of COVID-19, I mean retailers and specifically I mean the convenience store retailers then reset for most part I mean [indiscernible] for the summer. There was a clear focus for you; I mean to make sure that you were able to implement your new innovation. So just curious, I mean, in all your retailers and the convenience store retailers, I mean, are they all reset them in their shelves? And did you gain shelf space for the energy category or the performance energy, and/or either I mean any additional retailers that need to convert to a larger shelf. I know it's late in the summer but because of COVID-19 I mean, there was some delays. So want to have you taken these. Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : A lot of the retailers are merchandised by the bottlers. So even though the space was allocated, they may not have got to merchandise the product at the start of the resets. So where we're at now, as I mentioned, learn that guys are back in the field. And they're working with the bottlers to ensure that all of our innovation get the space that has been contractually allocated and just getting away from where we were in the early part of the pandemic where -- it was hands off. And if you look at how the convenience channel has grown and is continuing to grow, I think it's a far cry from where we were in March and April when all of this started. Rodney Sacks : But that being said, I think that, it really is a work in progress. I don't think we've got to a point where we could say that it's all -- everything that was planned is back in line and everything was achieved. I think it's because it's out of cycle and because of the difficulties just still being faced, generally. It is a slower effort, it's being done, it's slow, but it is improving all the time. But I think it's still not where we would like to see it. But hopefully we will continue to improve as we go through the next few months. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. Sets are done for the most part, but it's the distribution actual physical distribution of the products on the sets on the shelves that our field teams are working on. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for his final remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not too distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read the cautionary announcement. Thomas Kelly : Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operation. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.  Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on August 6, 2020, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.  The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 5, 2020. A copy of this information is also available on our website : www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. Let me begin by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved record third quarter net sales and the highest quarterly net sales in the company's history. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the third quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Since mid-March 2020, we have seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-premise consumption. Our sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third quarter.  Now e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery related business continued to increase in the quarter, while our food service on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company, remained challenged. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture, and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we are not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and our supply chain remains intact. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. With certain countries, particularly in EMEA, returning to lockdowns and other restrictions, consumer demand could be impacted, and we are unsure of what impact this may have, if any, on our future performance.  Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm, continues to be actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as those involved with the recent natural disasters in the U.S. Based on currently available information, we do not expect to COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. In the third quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.25 billion as compared with $1.13 billion in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 third quarter would have been up 11.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 third quarter was 59.1% compared with 59.4% in the 2019 third quarter.  Decrease for the 2020 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical sales mix and higher allowances as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by favorable aluminum can pricing. Operating expenses for the 2020 third quarter were $277.9 million compared to $277.6 million in the 2019 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 third quarter were 22.3% compared to 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter, primarily the result of decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements of $14.1 million and decreased expenditures of $9.3 million for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The costs for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized.  The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $14.5 million, increased expenditures of $7.4 million for social media and digital marketing and increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $6 million.  Operating income was $458.6 million up from $395.4 million in the third quarter of 2019. Net income increased 16.3% to $347.7 million as compared to $298.9 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 third quarter increased 19.6% to $0.65 from $0.55 in the third quarter of 2019.

Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300, were 24.6% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 17.1% higher. Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the 4 weeks ended October 24, 2020 was 49.9%, up 3.9 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.3%, up 0.9 of a point.  According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon, in the United States, for the 4-week period ending October 17, 2020, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots, increased 157.5% over the same period the previous year.

According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended October 3, 2020, the energy drink category increased 15.9% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 19.7% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 39.7%, up 1.3 points.

According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category declined 3.7% for the month of September 2020. Monster sales decreased 7.4%. Our market share in value decreased 1.1 points to 28.1% against the comparable period the previous year. Red Bull sales decreased 19%, and its market share decreased by 1.2 points to 6.6%.

Predator, which was launched in March 2020, achieved a market share of 1.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is the short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2020, compared to September 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 27.9% to 44.1%, in Brazil from 26.1% to 33.3% and in Chile from 38% to 45.6%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of September and beginning of October 2020, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.9% to 13.4% in Belgium, from 21.5% to 25.3% in Great Britain, from 20.7% to 21.4% in Italy, from 14.9% to 20% in Poland, from 33.3% to 35.5% in Spain, but declined from 27.6% to 25.4% in France, from 15.7% to 14.1% in Germany and from 7.2% to 7.1% in the Netherlands.  According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of August and the beginning of September, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 23.6% to 25.2% in Denmark, from 23.9% to 28.6% in Norway, from 23% to 26.2% in the Republic of Ireland, from 17.4% to 20.2% in South Africa and from 13% to 13.3% in Sweden, while it remained flat at 36.6% in Greece and declined from 13.4% to 13% in the Czech Republic.  The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending October 11, 2020, increased from 9.8% to 12.7% as compared to the same period the previous year.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the third quarter of 2020 increased from 51.2% to 55% as compared to the same period in the previous year.  We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4 week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these periods.  Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $444.5 million, 35.7% of total net sales in the 2020 third quarter compared to $379.8 million or 33.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.5 million in the 2020 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.  In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased 15.8% in dollars and increased 15.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.5% compared to 39.3% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by foreign exchange rates. It would have been slightly higher at 40.1% in local currencies. We're also pleased that in the third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 23.1% in dollars and 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2019.  Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.2% versus 40.5% over the same period in 2019. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 4.6% in dollars and 3.9% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 170.7% in dollars and 174.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China, net sales increased 20.6% in dollars in the quarter and 22.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 38.1% in dollars and 35% in local currencies.  Sales of the Monster brand in Oceania increased 54.7% in dollars and 50.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 6.1% in dollars and 31.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.9% compared to 44% over the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 38.5% in dollars and 90.3% in local currency. Net sales in Chile decreased 21.1% in dollars and 11.8% in local currency in the quarter.  I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks. Several proceedings are currently ongoing with VPX, including claims for false advertising and trademark and trade dress infringement brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. The company's lawsuit for unfair competition, false advertising and misappropriation of trade secrets is scheduled for trial in September 2021. In VPX's lawsuit against the company, returning to its allegation that Reign infringes the Bang trade risk, VPX's trade dress infringement claims were trialed in the Southern District of California in late August and early September and the company is awaiting a final judgment on these claims. Hilton Schlosberg : Rod, it's the Southern District of Florida. Rodney Sacks : Of Florida, sorry, of Florida. I beg your pardon. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel, Lilikoi Lychee in August 2020. And in early October, we launched Ultra Watermelon, Juice Monster Papillon and Juice Monster Khaotic to the retail trade.  In Canada, during the third quarter of 2020, Ultra Rosa was launched in July, followed by the launch of Reign Energy in August in 4 flavors. In El Salvador, we launched Fury Gold Strike as our first entry in the country in the affordable energy category during July, which is performing well.  In August 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Brazil in our largest LATAM market. Additionally, in September 2020 in Brazil, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 2 flavors. June 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Argentina and in August 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Chile. As markets eased restrictions after lockdowns, we were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the third quarter. Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets, have recently reintroduced lockdowns, which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Norway and Poland in September 2020 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA.  Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 2020 and is now available in 23 markets across EMEA. We are planning to launch Juice Monster Pacific Punch in an additional 5 markets later in 2020. Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Namibia in July 2020 and Mozambique and Mayotte in August 2020 and is now available in 38 markets across EMEA. We are planning to launch Juice Monster Mango Loco in an additional 7 markets in 2020. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Iceland, Poland and South Africa in August 2020, and in Malta in September 2020 and is now available in 18 EMEA markets.  We are planning to launch Monster Ultra in an additional 3 markets in 2020. The Monster Mule was launched in Poland in July 2020, and in Germany, Sweden and South Africa in September 2020. We're planning to launch Monster Mule in an additional 5 markets in 2020. Espresso Monster, mocha and vanilla variants were launched in Hungary in September and are now available in 21 markets in EMEA. Reign Total Body Fuel was launched in Norway and Iceland in September, and is now available in 8 markets in EMEA.  We are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel in an additional 4 markets in 2020. We launched Predator, our primary affordable energy brand in Ethiopia in August 2020, and we've also introduced Predator Purple Rain in South Africa in September 2020. We launched Burn Gold Spark in Turkey in August 2020, and we launched Burn Peach Zero in Hungary and Ukraine in August 2020. In Japan, in the third quarter of 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in approximately 90% of the country. We are continuing to build on our #1 country share position in value. In South Korea, in the third quarter of 2020, Monster Energy increased its #1 share position in value. We launched Ultra Paradise in late June. In China, in May 2020, we began distribution of our new noncarbonated Monster Energy Dragon Tea, which has received early positive consumer feedback. During the 2020 third quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon Tea, along with Monster Green and Ultra White. Large parts of India still remain in national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 third quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of November 5, 2020, approximately 441.5 million remained available for repurchase and under the previously authorized share repurchase program.  We estimate October 2020 gross sales to be approximately 14.8% higher than in October 2019. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2020, gross sales would have been approximately 14.9% higher than comparable October 2019 gross sales.  October 2020 had one less selling day than October 2019. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.  We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe.  In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno Thermogenic Fuel high-performance energy drinks. We are planning for future launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.  We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands outside of the United States. Despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So we've seen category growth come back at pretty healthy levels looking at the U.S. and Europe. You mentioned the sequential improvement within Q2. Obviously, October seems solid. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of your perspective on category growth here post COVID. Are you seeing more of a sustained pickup perhaps people are substituting energy drinks for coffee shop consumption? Or should we still expect sort of below pre COVID growth levels with the consumer not back to full mobility? Just really wanted to get some perspective on category growth. And I'm thinking more longer-term ex restrictions, but while you're on the subject, perhaps you could touch on the short-term risk from the second round of restrictions also? Rodney Sacks : All right. I'll take that. I think that we're in an area of uncertainty. I think everybody is guessing as to whether people are going to be switching from coffee to energy. I think what we do know is that there are substantial channels, which is from the convenience channel to larger packages and take-home packages.  I think that's, obviously, also impacted the certain impact, for example, on-premise, I think the -- some of our competitors have substantial on-premise businesses. I think those businesses have been impacted more severely than we have because we have smaller on-premise.  But I think that's resulted in some channel switching. So how this is -- this mix is all going to pan out, at the end of the day, we really -- I think it's just speculative for us to anticipate. But what we do know is, obviously, we've seen the trends. We're seeing the higher sell rates for the category. We are seeing our own numbers through Nielsen.  And obviously, our own numbers internally in the company continuing to strengthen. We've had good momentum and we've got good innovation. I think the innovation this year has been very disrupted all over the world. We launched some products just before COVID hit, some products during COVID, some products we've tried to get out late in summer. And I think a lot of those things are still disrupting our sales, but we obviously feel that as we go forward, I think things will settle down more.  But again, we just don't know. You're having Europe sort of going backwards again a number of their countries are now starting to impose restrictions. So we don't know how this will all turn out, Dara. It's just too speculative for us to give you any real guidance. I just don't think anybody really knows. Hilton Schlosberg : Maybe I can just add a little color, if you wouldn't mind. So what we're seeing is that caffeine is a need state for consumers, okay? And we're also seeing that energy drinks are an affordable luxury. So even though people are at home in greater quantities than they've been before, they're drinking more energy drinks and they could very much as well drink coffee, which they're doing, which is obviously the cup is cheaper than an energy drink.  So I think we're not going to go back to where we were before. We're going to go back to somewhere that's kind of in the middle of where we were and where we are now. And so my color is -- and I don't give guidance, we never give guidance. But if I'm thinking about the category and the category growth that has been sustained in this time of COVID, it's -- you can enjoy your own conclusions, but that's the kind of color that I've been thinking of. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Can you help us with the sales cadence in the quarter? Was there any reason like retailers rebuilding inventory ahead of the -- any potential pricing to explain this lumpiness in a certain amount of region? I guess from the strong July that you included in the last call, implied a deceleration in August and September, to high single digits, but then sharply reaccelerated now in October. And just a follow-up commentary about EMEA. What is your view of the impact of the lockdowns now and the current mobility as well? Rodney Sacks : I didn't hear that very much of what you were saying. It was very unclear. I don't know if you heard it, Hilton, perhaps you could... Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. I think Andrea was talking about Red Bull. Is that correct? Andrea Teixeira : No. Yes, sorry for the technical issues, but I was just asking about the sales cadence in the quarter. Was there any reason why you saw some in July and then... Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. You're talking about our cadence? Andrea Teixeira : Yes, your cadence. Correct. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. So what happened, and we can go through the history on that, but what happened was that our bottlers decreased inventories, and we spoke about that. And then there comes a time when they have to order to get to inventories back to where they should be, bearing in mind the depletions. So there's been a steady percentage growth in depletions, which were not sort of matched by orders.  And so what you've seen in the quarter is a steady rebuild of inventories in the distribution system in order to support the growth at retail. And also what happened in the quarter was that many of our bottlers were back, particularly in the U.S. in more full force, so they were covering the stores in a better frequency than they had in the past. So that's where we saw that acceleration.  And then your second question was about EMEA. And I would refer you to what happened in the first and second quarters in EMEA. The third quarter, particularly in EMEA, was really strong. But the EMEA guys felt there was still a lot of runway. So we know what October is and we've spoken about October. In November and December, we'll -- as again, we don't give guidance, but we don't know what the impact of the lockdowns are going to be, but we've got some sense for what happened earlier this year. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I guess just building on one of the earlier questions on the U.S. Not that it's not improving as pandemic lessens and mobility increases. More curious your thoughts about the still disconnect that we're seeing in the data between your business and Red Bull or even Red Bull share gains versus the category. So you mentioned that you're doing a better job. You talked about that last earnings call about the coast system being back in the market, I think, right around July or so. But Red Bull is now growing close to 20%. So what do you think is really contributing to their outperformance? And how do you think that sustains, if it does, as we go into next year, and they, in particular, have to lap that and you guys have to lap easier comparisons? Rodney Sacks : I think Red Bull probably going to start having a tougher time on comparisons. But I think what they -- what you can see is they've got a lot of impetus in the 12 ounce. We think there's been some increased consumption because a lot of Red Bull's business was done in the bars. And I think people who are just not going to bars but are still using Red Bull as mixes are probably following them in the off-premise channels. And that's, I think, we think it could be contributing to some of their increase. As I think we said on the last call, I think that the Red Bull has a very dedicated and focused distribution system. And they, I think, stayed in the field and had focused much, much better than not only Coke, but Pepsi's and every -- all of the bigger companies. I think that is -- we are still seeing the effects of that. Their execution has been good. And you can see that in comparison to some of the other competitors who are negative, even though one would have expected some of them to have started going into positive territory. And so that's an issue which we are addressing. They had some good innovation, but the innovation has now sort of leveled off a little bit, but you're seeing large gains, particularly as I said in the 12 ounce, right across their whole line, including the -- some of the original products.  And I think that we're getting back. We've got new products introduced now. I think we've got to get a little more focus and what we've done is we are now stepping up. We have basically created a new division with a street team having -- we've appointed a Chief Field Execution Officer with a pretty -- a lot of dedicated group of people under him to really focus.  I think we've probably been underperforming, and we've had not enough attention in the independents where you get trial and variation for -- and particularly trial for your innovation. So we are gearing up with what we're calling our street team. So that's something new and that we're going to implement. We're in the throes of it right now, and it will start being fully operational in the next month or 2. And then as we get it going, we're going to expand it. We think that will address a lot of the independent channel where we think that we perhaps have fallen a little behind. That being said, we are still obviously growing very nicely. And it's a question of the disparate proportion between us and Red Bull.  But if you look at the rest of the category, we're doing well. If you look at Reign, it's growing at about the same rate as Red Bull. And we think that for some of our new innovation that we've just launched, have been really well received, the Ultra Watermelon. And the 2 juice products, we have some good innovation coming next year. Once things settle down, we think that we will get -- we'll be in a good position to attack that differential. Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : And maybe just to piggyback on Mark's question and talk a little bit about the innovation. I guess just with the introduction of Watermelon, a, has that shipped at this point? And maybe just talk to us a little bit about what you observed with seasonality with that product. And help us understand, I guess, in your own internal planning, how you're thinking about how big that line could be relative to, say, an Ultra Paradise or a Fiesta or a Rosa? Rodney Sacks : It has shipped. It shipped at the beginning of October. And it's had a very good reception, both from our bottlers and from retailers. Very initial indications of sales per point in some of the retail chains are showing that it's really doing well. It's ahead of some of the others. I mean the Ultra Fiesta was a really good launch earlier this year and is continuing. Those are still new products, and that's continuing to grow.  But this is actually starting to outpace those ones after 3 to 4 weeks, we're actually seeing a higher rate of sale. But we've launched it now. We don't -- I think that like everything, it's -- it does get affected by the winter months, but we think that being a 0-calorie product, it will help the product. And we're quite optimistic for Watermelon as a really good opportunity. It's a really good product. And the whole Ultra line is continuing to perform really well. So any color on that, Hilton? Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. The only thing I would add is that the energy drink category is not as seasonal, as for example, sodas and other soft drinks and beer. And it is 0-calorie. It's on trend. We're seeing higher rates of sales in some of our major retailers. So as we transition into the January's and the better-for-you months, it's really very much on trend. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.  We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands we hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Gentlemen, please proceed. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Throughout this period, the company has engaged with its employees through ongoing communications, online training and personnel development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of the company's bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of its bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in foodservice on-premise consumption.  The company's sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is the company's largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020, third and fourth quarters. The company's sales in e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its foodservice on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company remained challenged.  Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and it\u2019s bottlers and distributors to distribute it\u2019s product as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and its supply chain remains intact. Company is continually addressing the increase in it\u2019s aluminum can requirements, given the companies volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. In the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.2 billion compared with $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter would have been up 18.3%. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan. We will refer to this on our call as product returns.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7% compared with 60% in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 59.3% for the 2020 fourth quarter.  To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which were partially offset by favorable product mix.  Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million compared to $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1% compared to 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily Q2 decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements as well as travel and entertainment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $11.4 million and increased expenditures of $8.2 million for social media and digital marketing. Operating income increased 26.9% to $402.3 million, up from $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 35.5% to $429.6 million from $317 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income increased 85% to $471.7 million as compared to $255 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million, due to an intra entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the companies foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis of such intangible assets. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the non-recurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 28.9% to $328.6 million from $255 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 87.5% to $0.88 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter excluding the non-recurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 30.6% to $0.62 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 13, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.2% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen in all measured channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 30th, 2021, the energy drink category increased 15.2% in dollars.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brand, during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2020 compared to December 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 34% to 45.5%; in Brazil from 25.2% to 32.2%; and in Chile from 40.3% to 47.2%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.8% to 15.4% in Belgium; from 28.3% to 31.1% in France; from 22% to 27.3% in Great Britain; and from 6.1% to 7.9% in the Netherlands.

Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ending January 17, 2021, increased from 9.4% to 12.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13% to 12.2% during the same period. Market share of the company's brands in Australia for the four weeks ended January 17, 2021, increased from 22.4% to 24.2%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended January 3, 2021, increased from 9.7% to 10.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 8.1% to 7%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.2% to 6. 1%. Market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended January 3, 2021, decreased from 24% to 23.9%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the month of December 2020 grew from 52% to 56.5% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of December 2020 decreased from 55.5% to 49.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the impact of the product returns in Japan as well as initial trial sales following the launch of new products by two large competitors. Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain markets statistics cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. We are seeing some recent softness in the performance in the Energy category in the U.S., which we are reviewing. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $384.8 million, 32.2% of total net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $319.5 million or 31.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Net sales to customers outside the United States for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the product returns. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.1 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 25% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Net sales adjusted for the product returns in this region, increased 30.5% in dollars and 27.4% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 30.2%, compared to 38.7% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was negatively impacted by the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs, foreign exchange rates as well as geographic mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 40.1% for the 2020 fourth quarter, compared with 38.7% in the same quarter of 2019. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 31.7%. We're also pleased that the fourth - in the fourth quarter Monster gained market share, in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2.1% in dollars and 5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. In Asia Pacific, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.4% in dollars and 2.5% in local currency over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% versus 40.2% over the same period in 2019. Excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and related costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.3% versus 40.2% in the comparable period in 2019. Japan net sales in the quarter decreased 16.4% in dollars and 18.4% in local currency without the impact of the product returns in Japan, net sales decreased 6.7%. In December 2020, our distributor in Japan reduced their inventories, because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Distributed depletions increased by approximately 12%, during the 2020 fourth quarter. In South Korea, net sales increased 55.8% in dollars and 52.3% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China, net sales decreased 5% in dollars in the quarter and 9.6% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2019. Distributor depletions increased as by approximately 29% during the 2020 fourth quarter. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 32.6% in dollars and 25.2% in local currencies.

In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 52.2% in dollars and increased 79.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 38.6% compared to 42.6% and over the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates as certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 74.9% in dollars and 133.6% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 72.9% in dollars and 80.3% in local currency in the quarter. Since our last earnings call in November 2020, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the maker of Bang Energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In early October 2020, in the United States, we launched Ultra Water Melon and Juice Monster Papillon to the trade. We also refreshed our Juice Monster Khaos SKU into the new Juice Monster Khaotic. Initial results are positive. In late January 2021 in the United States, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno, Watermelon Warlord to the trade. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a four pack. In late February 2021, we launched our core four flavors, Monster Green, Low-carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise, in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and foodservice. In Canada, in January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta and Java Monster with Oat Milk. February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras, and we launched Mean Green - and in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. We were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the 2020 fourth quarter. Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets have recently reintroduced lockdowns, which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Botswana in November 2020 and in Israel in January 2021 and is now available in 40 markets across EMEA. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Italy in February 2021 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra was launched in Serbia and Ukraine in October 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is now available in 22 EMEA markets. Monster Ultra Fiesta was launched in Great Britain and Sweden in January 2021 and in Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland and Spain in February 2021. The Monster Ultra Black was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020, it is now available in two EMEA markets. Monster \u201cThe Doctor\u201d was launched in Kenya in December 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. Monster Mule was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020 and in Great Britain and Iceland in January 2021 and in Austria, Belgium and Norway in February 2021. Monster Mule is now available in 10 EMEA markets. Burn Zero Raspberry was launched in Hungary in October 2020. Ultra Zero Raspberry was launched in Serbia in November 2020. Predator Purple Rain was launched in Namibia in December 2020 and is now available in three EMEA markets. Reign Sour Apple variant was launched in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland in October 2020. In November 2020, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Rosa in Australia and New Zealand, in addition to Bu Energy Island Punch in Papua New Guinea. China, we piloted our new non-carbonated Monster Energy Dragons Gold in a number of provinces during the fourth quarter of 2020. Initial consumer feedback has been positive and we will commence with the national rollout of Monster Energy Dragons! gold during 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon team along with Monster Energy Green and Monster Energy Ultra. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra and Monster Mango Loco in Singapore, Monster Mango Loco in Vietnam and Monster Energy Ultra in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets in 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of February 25, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate January 2021 sales to be approximately 18.2% higher than in January 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, January 2021 sales would have been approximately 17.2% higher than comparable January 2020 sales. January 2021 has had two fewer selling days in January 2020. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and UNI at redetermined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facility, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Two, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. More, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and the year. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hilton, I was hoping you could discuss the commodity cost outlook as you look out to 2021, particularly on the aluminum side. I know you won't get into guidance territory, but just any conceptual thoughts would be helpful. And if we do see sustained higher commodity costs, can you discuss your willingness to potentially take pricing to offset some of the higher costs? And how you think about that? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : Yeah. Dara, that's a really good question. I mean, in previous calls like this, I've spoken about the fact that we engage in contracts with aluminum can suppliers from time-to-time to fix some of our aluminum costs. And we've done a little bit of that for 2021. Obviously, we monitor aluminum costs every morning. And we've seen, as you've seen and the rest of the group have seen an increasing situation with regard to aluminum and also with the Midwest premium, which I think has taken a lot of us by surprise. The aluminum, the Midwest premium was in the upper-single digits some months ago and with the imposition of the tariffs on aluminum went up. And everyone expected that to fall. And it hasn't. It's just sitting at just below $0.16. So where we are, we're doing our best to manage our aluminum costs. And I'm not sure there's much more I can say other than, yes, we will - aluminum costs will increase over - in 2021 over 2020. So that is - that's a fact of life. And it will impact us as it will impact many other beverage companies. Rodney Sacks : And regarding your second question about take your price increase. We're not at this time we haven't been looking at taking a price increase. However, whatever rules out, take your price increase when the right opportunity presents itself. And right now, none of our competitors have been looking at price increases. I know we led the market last time. But this time, we're cautious, as indeed, we should be with our market share. And we're examining the opportunities to take price up. And we will, if we find there's an opportunity to do so. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Kevin Grundy : Congratulations on the strong result. For me, I'd like to ask about the seltzer category. Specifically, you made some comments recently at your Analyst Day we could get some news here, either on the alcohol side or even non-alcohol side. I know it's a big decision. And certainly not one where you want to be beholden to any sort of time line that Wall Street may have set. But any updated thoughts here with respect to what you've decided to enter and what that timing may be? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : I think that our position there is still much the same as we indicated on our last call. We are reviewing - they're very separate. If you go to the non-alcoholic side, it would be an energy product, obviously. If you go to the alcoholic side, you'd be then competing with all the other colleagues as the white claw and truly and the others that are in that category. We are continuing to evaluate both of them. We do believe we will have some news in the not too distant future, but we are looking at the positioning of what we're looking at opportunities on - particularly on the non-alcoholic side. The alcoholic side has become very crowded. And we are reviewing it. We are developing products, but whether we decide to pull the trigger and when and how is - we're just looking at where the category is going there before we make a decision on that side. So other than that, I just don't think there's much more that we can really provide to you as an update. As I said, on the non-alcoholic side, we just wouldn't like to get into those discussions and our plans in the clean energy area, which we are addressing and looking at. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Andrea Teixeira : I was hoping if you can comment on the inventory levels at the bottlers in light, obviously, with the pandemic. And obviously not to take away from your strong volumes, did the bottlers decide to take more inventory in the fourth quarter in January and also driven by your innovation. So perhaps you were taking the new products that I think the pipeline has been stronger than ever. So, if you can comment on that or, if we should see the pace of growth continuing? Rodney Sacks : So where we are Andrea, is an interesting territory because you can see that our sales are growing, I think, quicker than we had expected that they would. And we are doing everything we can to service our bottlers and get product to our bottlers, so they can service the retail trade. Having said that, I'm pretty confident that there's not excess inventories in the bottlers warehouses. Because I know what - that we're doing everything we can to satisfy their demand, and they have not been terribly happy with us in terms of getting product, because cans - excess cans are tight. And we're doing everything we can to service customers in an area where the market is growing quicker than our expectations. So from that perspective, I don't believe that the distributors are carrying any excess inventory in their system. And we also know, of course, we monitor depletions and depletions are in line with our shipments. Thomas Kelly : With regard to specific countries, I think we've already indicated in the transcript, we did make mention of the fact that of the differential in certain selected countries where we saw our distributors reducing their stock holding slightly because of anticipated slowdowns in retail in those particular countries. Rodney Sacks : That's correct. We spoke about that in China and Japan. And that is correct. Thomas Kelly : So we've given you those sort of indications. But other than that, seem to be reasonably good shape. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Astrachan : I guess I'm going to try to cheat and ask a short follow-up and then another question. I guess on the follow-up what prevents you from working more with the Coke system in procuring aluminium and manufacturing in general, so that you have a bit more of sharing of ability to supply bottlers. And second separate question is just could you update us, Rodney, probably on where you are from an SKU standpoint in terms of international markets sort of broadly versus where you are in the U.S., meaning, how many do you have on a typical shelf outside the U.S.? And what's the opportunity going forward for that? Hilton Schlosberg : So let me start, Mark. In terms of working with the Coca-Cola bottlers and working with the Coca-Cola system on procurement of cans, we're doing what we can to produce within the Coca-Cola network. Obviously, that's something that we like to do because it reduces shipping costs and improves efficiencies. But there are a whole bunch of products that we manufacture that cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. We do a wide range of products from hot four to and those products cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. So where we can, we try and work with the system. And obviously, that's our major focus. And that's been improving over the years. We've opened up a number of Coca-Cola facilities to produce Monster. On the other hand, on procurement, which is a question you asked, that's been a longer-term project, and we haven't resolved that situation yet. The Coke bottlers have their own organization, which is for the Coca-Cola bottling situation. We are not a bottler. And we don't fall within that mandate. So that's been a difficult discussion. And it's something that I'm hoping that we'll be able to progress in the future. But right now, we're doing our own procurement of all our raw materials, including aluminum and including cans. So Rodney you asked that, you answer the second question. Sure. Go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Yes. On the second one it's various from country to country, Mark. But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. And so we are continuing to expand the number of SKUS. But it does vary. And in some countries, we're trying to start accelerating that instead of doing just one a year. We're actually increasing the pace of innovation going on shelves. But it does vary quite dramatically from country-to-country. And where we can get receptiveness from retailers to increase the energy space, we obviously take advantage of that and increase more. And so we did, as you would have noticed from the call, we went into quite a lot of depth in EMEA in places like of new products and where we're introducing new flavors, because that pace is accelerating, but there is quite a long runway internationally for international markets to get up to the U.S. levels. And there are many products that haven't yet been launched at all in the international market. So the rehab products are in very few markets internationally, we just starting to launch some of the Hydro products. So there are a number of product lines or we call them as sub-families that aren't yet - don't appear in many international markets at all. So there is opportunity there. But it all depends on the appetite of retailers and their willingness to grant additional space. But I think that as we've seen everywhere, the category does increase sales - on a sales per unit basis, it is a hiring than other - a lot of other comparable beverages, competitive beverages. And so we are seeing a receptiveness from retailers to continually recognizing the category and increasing the allocation of space. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. It's just an evolution. It's a question of time. We generally start one or two SKUs, and we build from there. And if you look across the various countries that we are distributed in, some have more or less depending on when we started and the appetite for taking on additional products. But as the energy category grows, there is a huge opportunity to be able to do that. And then in some countries like in China, we've actually launched unique items that are not available in the U.S. In Brazil, we have a tea product, for example, that's also not available in the U.S. So there are a bunch of products under the Monster brand that are not available in the U.S. that are distributed internationally and of course, our strategic brands are in various countries in the world, many of those - many of the flavors that we sell in other parts of the world are not available in the U.S. So it really is a mixed bag and as we see an opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Galbo : Rodney, I just wanted to ask on capital allocation. It's been a couple of quarters, I guess, since we've seen some meaningful share repurchase. You talked about the authorization outstanding. Just help us kind of think about your appetite to do more potentially in 2021 and beyond. Thanks. Rodney Sacks : I think that what we did was we were quite active in the market, and then we saw an increase in uptick in the share price. And so we just sort of sat patiently, and that has moved forward. But again, as part of, I think, our own just review of our own opportunities and what we want to do, we've sort of been a bit patient because we are reviewing a number of additional potential product categories and sectors, and so until we make up our minds to determine how do we go about or address them. We're just sort of taking a cautious approach. And we'll see later in the year, whether we have the cash. And we'll decide on how to employ that, whether to use that to repurchase shares or potentially some other purposes. But we just wanted to rather be in a position to make - to be flexible in making that decision going forward. But if we don't have any other use for it, depending on our direction, we will continue to resume purchasing repurchases of shares. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Sacks and Schlosberg for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks very much. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and my Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call. As is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read the cautionary announcement. Tom Kelly : Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company\u2019s business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company\u2019s top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company\u2019s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s bottlers and distributors are operating and the company\u2019s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company\u2019s bottlers or distributors have, in part be negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record first quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company is experiencing shortages in its aluminum can requirements in North America and Europe given the company\u2019s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company has taken steps to source quantities of aluminum cans from South America and Asia. However, logistical issues, including ocean freight and port of entry congestion, could delay such supply. Logistical issues in relation to the importation of certain other raw materials and ingredients could impact future supply. Furthermore, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment. In the first quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.24 billion compared to $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 17.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 first quarter would have been up 16.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter was 57.5% and compared with 60% in this 2020 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of increased input costs mainly increased raw material freight-in costs, geographical sales mix and higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales. Operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $300.8 million compared with $272.2 million in the 2020 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were 24.2% compared with 25.6% in the 2020 first quarter. Operating income increased 13.5% to $414.1 million, up from $365 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net income increased 13% to $315.2 million as compared to $278.8 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 first quarter increased 14.2% to $0.59 from $0.52 in the first quarter of 2020. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 24, 2021 for all outlets combined namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 20.3% versus the same period a year ago.

Predator, which was launched in March 2020, achieved a market share of 2.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2021 compared to March 2020, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 37.9% to 45.2% and in Brazil from 25.4% to 34.7%. In Chile, Monster\u2019s retail market share decreased from 42.1% to 40%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended April 4, 2021, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.8% to 16% in Germany, from 19.7% to 28.1% in Italy, and from 17.3% to 20.6% in South Africa. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period till the end of March 2021, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.2% to 15.1% in Belgium; from 12.6% to 14.8% in the Czech Republic; from 24.5% to 26.4% in Denmark; from 28% to 31.8% in France; from 22.7% to 27.9% in Great Britain; from 34% to 37.7% in Greece; from 6.4% to 8% in the Netherlands; from 24.7% to 29.1% in Norway; from 15.3% to 18.2% in Poland; from 23.8% to 28% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 34% to 36% in Spain; and from 13.5% to 14.9% in Sweden. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster\u2019s market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021 increased from 10% to 13.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother\u2019s market share in value decreased from 13.6% to 11.8% during the same period. The market share of the company\u2019s brands in Australia for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021 increased from 23.6% to 24.9%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster\u2019s market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 18, 2021 increased from 9.9% to 12.7% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+\u2019s market share in value decreased from 7.4% to 6.5% and Mother\u2019s market share in value decreased from 6.5% to 5.6%.

According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster\u2019s market share in value in all outlets combined for the month of March 2021 increased from 52.3% to 54.8% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster\u2019s market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of March 2021 decreased from 62.1% to 50.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster remains the market leader in Japan. However, our share was negatively impacted by the labeling issue of a product referenced in our fourth quarter 2020 release, which was re-listed on retail shelves in April 2021 by the introduction of new SKUs by new competitor and by the timing of our 2021 innovation. We again pointed out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $459.4 million, a 36.9% of total net sales in the 2021 first quarter compared with $356.8 million and 33.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.3 million in the 2021 first quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 27.7% in dollars and increased 21.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter was 37.3% compared to 43.1% in the same quarter in 2020 primarily... Tom Kelly : 41.3%, sorry. Rodney Sacks : 41.3% primarily due to unfavorable country and product mix. We are also pleased that in the 2021 first quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 24.8% in dollars and 17.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales, was 48.8% versus 42% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 9.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 17% in dollars and 9.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In China, net sales increased 59.4% in dollars in the 2021 first quarter and 48% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 66% in dollars and 47.8% in local currencies. Sales of the Monster brand in Oceana increased 65.6% in dollars and 48.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 35.7% in dollars and increased 55.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37.9% compared to 42.5% over the same period in 2020 primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates as certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased by 34% in dollars and 70.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 48.9% in dollars and 37.7% in local currency in the 2021 first quarter. Since our last earnings call in February 2021, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., the maker of Bang energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today\u2019s call. In the United States, during early January 2021, we converted our 10-pack Monster portfolio into 12 packs. In late January 2021, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno Watermelon warlord. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4-pack. In late February 2021, we launched four core flavors : Monster Green, Low-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service channel. In late March 2021, we converted our entire Monster Hydro portfolio into 20-ounce PET containers and added 2 new Monster Hydro Super Sport SKUs, Kilo Kiwi and Macho Mango. In late March 2021, we also launched Rehab Monster Strawberry Lemonade as the first non-tea option in the Rehab Monster brand family. We refreshed 2 SKUs during the first quarter of 2021, Monster Max Super Dry into Monster Nitro Super Dry in a 16-ounce can as well as a refreshed design on Monster result. This summer, we are also planning to launch a new line of energy drinks under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which will contain an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. Initially, True North will have a limited target in 2021, with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. We are planning to launch additional new products later in 2021. In Canada, during early January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta, Java Monster Oat Milk as well as Monster Ultra Paradise 4-pack. Later in February 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in singles as a 310 ml option. In early March 2021, we launched Reign Lilikoi Lychee singles and Reign Orange Dreamsicle in singles and a 4-pack. We also launched NOS Turbo in March 2021. In February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. In March 2021, we launched Ultra Watermelon in Puerto Rico and Ultra Paradise in Aruba. We introduced a number of SKUs across EMEA in the 2021 first quarter. Highlights include the geographical expansion of a number of existing Monster Reign and strategic brand products into new countries, including Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Monarch, which is Papillon in non-EMEA markets, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Monster Ultra Paradise, Monster Ultra Fiesta, Monster Zero Ultra, Monster Ultra Blue, Black Monster Ultra Sunrise in Russia, Monster Mule, Burn Zero Peach and Play Zero Peach. Various Reign SKUs, including Reign Melon Mania, Sour Apple, Razzleberry, Peach Fuzz, Orange Dreamsicle and Lemonades were launched in Belgium; the Netherlands, South Africa, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with one chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Super Fuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors. During the 2021 first quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we began shipments in the quarter in Japan for the re-launch at retail of Ultra Paradise in April 2021. During the 2021 first quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Hong Kong and Macau and began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or market lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. During the 2021 first quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of May 6, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate April 2021 sales to be approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2021 sales would have been approximately 67.8% higher than comparable April 2020 sales. April 2021 had the same number of selling days as April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative April 2020 sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we reported that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales, with the same number of selling days in both periods. In this regard, we are caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, currently, the company\u2019s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Five, finally, please note that similar to last year in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual stockholders\u2019 meeting exclusively as a viral meeting via live webcast. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions can be found in the company\u2019s proxy statement. I\u2019d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : Hi, everyone. Hilton Schlosberg : Hi, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : I wanted \u2013 hello. I wanted to ask you guys about the shortages of cans you\u2019re experiencing. Could you give us a sense of how big of a driver that was of your gross margin contraction in the quarter? I mean was it the bulk of that, for instance? And I\u2019m curious to hear if the situation has deteriorated further in April and May? And then finally, when do you expect the shortage situation to improve or maybe stabilize? I mean, I guess, trying to understand if we all should assume this will be a pretty big issue for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Rodney Sacks : Okay. So maybe I can get that, Bonnie. So what happened when we set our can requirements with our can companies about a year ago, we estimated that our sales would be 10% to 12% or up this year. In fact, as you can see, they are substantially above that. So whatever we contracted for, we\u2019ve got. What happened with our sales in January and February, ourselves were doing okay. And then in March, they have spiked up. And as Rodney quoted, in April, they are spiked up yet again. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve procured additional cans from South America and from Asia that will start coming in late in the second quarter. We also have new can companies that are opening their doors later this year, and we will be drawing cans from those companies as well. So to answer your question about the first quarter, yes, there was an impact. And the big impact, as we mentioned, in the release and on this call is that the bigger impact was these freight in costs where we were drawing product, for example, from Canada, and we were shipping product from various locations to our distribution center that impacted cost of sales. We also had \u2013 we broke our orbits. In other words, we\u2019ve always tried to manufacture and sell within regions to avoid excessive shipping costs. We had to break that this year to satisfy consumer demand and so that was another factor that impinged on the results. But the margin was impacted by \u2013 not only by those freight costs, but \u2013 excuse me, as we mentioned by the promotional allowances that were higher in the second quarter across the board. And also, from our geographical sales mix, because as you know, we sold a significantly higher percentage of product overseas than we did in the U.S. So it\u2019s the same story that we\u2019ve experienced and we\u2019ve spoken to shareholders, the more we sell overseas, the lower is our gross margin percentage. But again, I must caution shareholders that we bank dollars, we don\u2019t bank gross profit percentages. And in taking the decisions we took in the first quarter, it was important to do so to satisfy demand. We knew the profitability would be higher, but the percentage may, in fact, be lower, which it was. Operator : The next question is from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Laurent Grandet : Yes. Good evening everyone. And actually, I want to dig a bit more in what you\u2019re just saying in terms of gross margin. So you mentioned freight, so I understand that\u2019s the number one. The aluminum cans, you mentioned also, I mean, promotional activity. So if we were to put some numbers, it\u2019s freight, 50% of the impact. I mean aluminum can and now maybe 30% and promotional activity, 20%. I\u2019d like to basically understand this a bit better. If you can, give us an idea here, that would be great? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : So Laurent, we spoke about the first quarter. In the first quarter, the impact of the aluminum can costs were not a major factor. And as you know, and everyone else on the call probably knows as well that we have suffered significant and will set a significant increases in aluminum costs going forward. So for example, it\u2019s no secret, but if you look back on a year ago, aluminum costs are up 83.6%, including the Midwest premium in the U.S., and they are up 71%, 71.1% in Europe. So as we go forward, we may not have some of the cost impacts on gross margin, but we certainly will have impacts on aluminum in the second and subsequent quarters. So for me to talk more about the first quarter, we don\u2019t actually give the numbers out that you\u2019re asking for. But what I can say is that I don\u2019t expect the margins to improve going forward this year. I expect that we will not \u2013 that our margins will not improve as we go into the second, third. Possibly the fourth quarter, I think things will be better. That\u2019s my analysis. But certainly in the second and third quarter, we will continue to suffer gross margin percentage in our stress gross margin percentage erosion. Operator : The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi everyone. Hilton Schlosberg : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : So obviously, a big \u2013 hey, so obviously, a big number quarter to-date. And I guess the question is, with the aluminum supply shortages that you have, are you going to run into some issues with the ability to fill that demand? And could that prevent you from doing some things that might help with your gross margin, which sounds like they could improve by Q4, like taking any pricing in the business? Hilton Schlosberg : So that\u2019s obviously something that we\u2019re very aware about on pricing. I know what some of our competitors, some of the big beverage companies have spoken about with regard to pricing. But I\u2019m not sure that we would take \u2013 move ourselves. Last time we went ahead and did it irrespective of Red Bull\u2019s strategy with regard to pricing. They \u2013 I think this time around, we\u2019re examining what they will be doing. Remember, they are importing a substantial amount of their cans and product from overseas. So we will be watching that. But there are other ways to take price up, for example, we can reassess, which we are doing, structure of promotional allowances to move margins in a more positive direction. But again, we don\u2019t want to disturb the business that is doing very well. Our share is \u2013 we\u2019re happy with where the business is going. We\u2019re happy with our share, and we know when to disturb what we already have. So we bring in cans from abroad, as I said, we\u2019re getting new cans in the system later on in the year. And as far as we\u2019re concerned, we will continue to examine the opportunity to take price. And if necessary, as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re looking at on our promotional allowances as well. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you, and good afternoon. On the True North Organic Energy launch, should we assume that the impact will be mostly concentrated in the second half, and particularly in 2022? And does that mean you have decided to remain in non-alcohol segment and you\u2019re not launching a hard seltzer for now? And then hit on the gross margin, and I appreciate your commentary maybe perhaps we should assume that it may get worse before it gets better, given the freight and aluminum have actually been sequentially worse? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Perhaps I\u2019ll take the part of it, and Hilton can take part of it. On True North, we are, as I indicated, we are going to have limited sales just going into and seeding the market this year. The full launch and rollout will take place early in \u2013 from the beginning or early in 2022. So it will \u2013 we think it will have an impact in 2022, and we will have much less of an impact this year. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Andrea, you were talking about margins. As I said, I don\u2019t think margins will get better in the second and the third quarter, margin percentages, but with robust sales which is obviously something that we\u2019re looking at in terms of our own forecasting, although we don\u2019t give guidance, we must look at the bottom line, and we must not necessarily look at percentages. Because what we have to do as part of our everyday function is to satisfy the demand of our customers because the last thing we want to do is to have our bottlers on the line without inventory, our consumers gravitating to other products. And we have to maintain the status quo. The company is doing really well on the top line. And we, hopefully, will continue to do so. Rodney Sacks : Yes. Just \u2013 and then just to complete your question with regard to the alcoholic CELSIUS side. I don\u2019t think you can assume that we are going into it or not going into it. Don\u2019t make that assumption. We\u2019ve addressed the nonalcoholic sell some market. We\u2019ve decided a strategy, and we\u2019ve developed products. And align, and we are going to launch that line. As regards to alcoholic sensing, we are still looking at the market. I think if you have been watching the market, I\u2019m sure the analysts have been. I think you\u2019ve seen quite a lot of \u2013 a fortune of new products being launched, many \u2013 in cases from the same companies, just different variants. Throwing them against the wall and seeing what\u2019s going to stick. What you\u2019ve also seen in the last 3 months, what we\u2019ve noticed is quite a falloff in the rate of increase in the category. And as the category is maturing, so the increase is also tempering. So we are involved in looking at that category in developing products and as I think I\u2019ve said in the last call, we simply don\u2019t want to launch a product. That\u2019s me-too and that follows everyone else. It\u2019s just no point in that and taking the time and effort and detracting from our focus on our core energy brands and portfolio, where we get a better return and have, obviously, it\u2019s much easier for us to get meaningful sales. But we are continuing to monitor the alcoholic energy seltzer category. And we may well do something in that. But how we do it and what we do it is still not being determined and still not \u2013 we don\u2019t have a firm direction. So, all I can really say is just that we are addressing it, but we shouldn\u2019t assume that we are definitely going to go ahead or definitely not going to go ahead or how. Operator : The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Hey, thanks, and good afternoon everyone. I guess, don\u2019t kill me I am going to ask a bunch of it for follow-up questions here so helping restrain yourself for a second. Hilton Schlosberg : Sure. Mark Astrachan : I guess on \u2013 are can shortages impacting your U.S. market share, if not, or if they are, could you maybe just talk about kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. also, could you clarify on the gross margin you\u2019re talking about relative to 1Q levels for 2Q and 3Q? Or are you talking about \u2013 you\u2019re not giving us any sort of color on 2Q and 3Q relative to 1Q? And then back to the other question on pricing and then related to promotional allowances. So your capacity constrained, at least for the time being, what\u2019s the harm in taking price to constrain the demand and then also, you\u2019re suggesting then the promotional allowances after 1Q will lessen in 2Q, 3Q kind of for the same effect? Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So where do you want me to start? So I think it is fair to say that out of stocks have impacted share. I don\u2019t know how big that impact is. And I\u2019m not going to because honestly, we don\u2019t know. But what we do know is that Red Bulls on-premise has moved into the measured channels. There is no question about that. I think we underestimated the impact of their on-premise business moving into major channels. However, our share is doing nicely. Our sales are growing very nicely. And frankly, we are selling everything that we can make. And what you guys are not seeing or not addressing is things like Amazon. We spoke about the Stackline data and our other unmeasured channels, for example, the Home Depots and the Lowe\u2019s and the home improvement stores and all those other parts of the business that are very strong for us are continuing to grow and continue to gain share in those particular channels. So overall, I think we are satisfied with where we are, as I said earlier. And we\u2019re anticipating that as soon as we they can start coming to the U.S., and we start being in a more orderly situation that we will continue to grow again as we anticipate. So that was one question. Your second question was on margins. And I think I said that I expect my personal view, and this is not guidance, but I expect margins to get worse in the second and third quarter before they get better. So that\u2019s my answer to that. Mark, just remind me, what are your other questions? Mark Astrachan : Pricing and promotional allowances relative to capacity constraints. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. I think pricing, I said to you, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate. And we\u2019re doing this on a honestly, on a daily basis. We would like Red Bull to lead, but if they don\u2019t lead, we will make a decision as to where we should or shouldn\u2019t go with regard to pricing. With regard to promotional allowances, that is correct. We will \u2013 we are putting back promotional allowances, and you should see \u2013 we should see some impact in future quarters. Operator : Next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So just one quick clarity question and then one broader question, just \u2013 it does sound like there is a little bit of demand impact from the lack of full supply on the aluminum side. Are you expecting that to be a significant issue in Q2 before it gets better and you get some of this incremental supply in, just trying to understand that in the short-term? And then just a broader question, we\u2019ve obviously seen an acceleration in U.S. energy category growth the last few quarters after the initial weakness for a few months post-COVID. Can you just review what you think the key factors have been behind that acceleration in U.S. category growth? How sustainable they are going forward as we sort of look to that cycling that higher category growth in the back half of the year? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So maybe I\u2019ll just take the first one, and then we will get Rodney to take the second one. So Dara, if you look at April sales, for example, and you take out \u2013 you strip out what happened in 2020. And you can see that there was a very big impact in sales in the second quarter and a very positive impact. So it is presenting challenges to the supply chain team, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that we\u2019re able to keep as much as possible in stock. In fact, we\u2019re focusing on the SKUs that are generating the significant part of our volumes at the expense of SKUs that are not performing as well. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re at with regard to the second quarter. We will be getting cans in. If these port issues resolve themselves, and we will \u2013 we\u2019re trying as best as we can to get back in stock as soon as possible. A - Rodney Sacks : Yes. Just to \u2013 just add \u2013 just one thing. The uncertainty that we\u2019ve got is, obviously, for cans that we\u2019re importing, we are also incurring freight costs above the aluminum cost or can price. So that\u2019s why those costs will go up the shorter term. As the additional plants in the U.S. come on stream, we will get back to a more normalized pricing structure for cans and get the additional volume. So it\u2019s a little difficult now to predict exactly where we\u2019re going to go on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis, but we think it will normalize, as Hilton said, towards the fourth quarter. With regard to the increased category, I think we\u2019re already in a world of just unknowns. The category had a really steep hit rewards in late March, early April last year. Different in different parts of the world, when a lot of the bottlers literally took their staff and people teams out of the markets. But it has come back and the growth has come back really, really nicely. And so one of the things that we were \u2013 which were sort of unusual, we found that the growth was generally, historically has always been led by the convenience channel at a higher rate than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And that sort of reversed itself with COVID. So again, you\u2019re looking at factors that are just not normal. What we have seen, as you can see from the last 4 weeks numbers, we quoted in Nielsen from convenience, that started to pick up again quite nicely. So again, we\u2019re in a very uncertain period because of what happened last year and your comps on last year. But even if you look at the 2-year stack sort of set of numbers, you\u2019re getting some healthy growth back, where the category had slowed a little bit towards the end of \u201819, the growth was \u2013 they were still growing a bit slower. So we think that we will see continued growth regardless of how we come out of COVID and how our people come back into the markets. And we are hopeful for that. But again, it\u2019s \u2013 we just can\u2019t predict that at this stage. Our numbers are good. The numbers are strong. And Red Bull\u2019s numbers have been strong again, a little bit, we think, skewed by the switch from on-premise to off-premise, but continue to grow. And obviously, we are the main players in the category. And so, the category growth is driven by our \u2013 respectively, by our two brands respective sales. So I think it all goes well for us, but we just don\u2019t have any \u2013 I can\u2019t give you any further color on it because we would be guessing, I think we all are. Tom Kelly : Yes. So the only thing I would add to that is that I always look at the first quarter of 2020 because that was kind of a pure quarter for us. COVID started kind of late in the quarter, where our sales were already in-house. And so the first quarter for us was really 2020 was really kind of a normal quarter. And if you look back to that first quarter, and I always do. First quarter net sales in 2020 over 2019 rose 12.3%. So even as we entered into COVID, our sales were strong. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg for closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks very much. On behalf of Monster, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy it\u2019s remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the near future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks, Co-CEO, to begin the call. Please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I\u2019m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company\u2019s top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company\u2019s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company\u2019s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company\u2019s bottlers and distributors have, in part, been negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record second quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company continues to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA, given the company\u2019s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company is also experiencing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the company was unable to fully satisfy demand in the 2021 second quarter in the United States and EMEA. We expect such challenges to continue for the next few months. The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from the United States, South America and Asia. The company has entered into new supply agreements with two new aluminum can suppliers in the United States, and which are expected to be operational in the 2021 fourth quarter. We expect deliveries of additional quantities of cans increasing sequentially during the latter part of the year. Logistical issues, including shortages of shipping containers and port of entry congestion could delay ongoing international supply of aluminum cans. Separately, we are continuing to experiencing \u2013 experience freight inefficiencies as well as significant increases in domestic and international freight costs and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment, all of which in addition to other factors, will continue to adversely impact gross margin percentages. In the second quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.46 billion, compared with $1.09 billion in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 33.6%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 second quarter would have been up 30.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 second quarter was 57.2% compared with 60.3% in the 2020 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021, was primarily the result of geographical sales mix and increased input costs, mainly increased raw material freight in costs and aluminum can costs. Operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were $310.9 million, compared with $252.2 million in the 2020 second quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were 21.3%, compared with 23.1% in the 2020 second quarter. Operating income increased 29.1% to $526 million, up from $407.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. Net income increased to 29.7% and to $403.8 million compared to $311.4 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 second quarter increased to 28.6% to $0.75 from $0.59 in the second quarter of 2020. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 24, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 14.2% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 19, 2021, the energy drink category increased 17.9% in dollars. Sales of the company\u2019s energy drink brands increased 28.3% versus a year ago. The market share of the company\u2019s energy drink brands was 41.5%, up 3.4 points.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2021 compared to June 2020, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 40.1% to 46.9% and in Brazil from 29.6% to 35.4%. In Chile, Monster\u2019s retail market share decreased from 45.7% to 41.9%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 18, 2021, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 34.2% to 37.4% in Spain. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of June 2021, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.5% to 15.3% in Germany, from 18.4% to 19.4% in Poland and from 18.4% to 20.1% in South Africa.

The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were $546.3 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 second quarter compared to $328.3 million or 30% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $38.6 million in the 2021 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased to 105.7% in dollars and increased 86.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 39.8% compared to 38.1% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to a favorable country and product mix. We\u2019re also pleased that in the 2021 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased 5.2% in dollars and decreased 0.1 of a percent in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.4% versus 43.3% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 second quarter decreased 15.1% in dollars and 13.9% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. Depletions increased 7% during the quarter. Monster remains the market leader in Japan for the month of June 2021. In South Korea, net sales increased 63% in dollars and 50.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In China, net sales decreased to 21.4% in dollars and 27.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In this regard, we note that sales in the second quarter of 2020 included the initial launch of Dragon Tea. We are reevaluating the viability of this SKU and the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased to 146.5% in dollars and 98.2% in local currencies.

In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased to 119.7% in dollars and increased 117.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.7% compared to 41.2% over the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates and certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased by 194.9% in dollars and 201.7% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 77.5% in dollars and 52% in local currency in the 2021 second quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 291.4% in dollars and 458% in local currency in the 2021 second quarter. In March 2019, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks, sued Monster, alleging that its Reign products infringed VPX\u2019s Bang trademarks and trade risk. A trial was held last year. And on August 3, 2021, the court issued an order denying all of VPX\u2019s claims and holding that VPX is entitled to no relief whatsoever. In fact, the court specifically found that VPX copied its bank trade risk from the original Monster Energy cans. The court\u2019s decision confirms that Monster and Poland retail partners are free to continue to sell our Reign products without any changes and without any restrictions. Monster always believed and maintained that VPX\u2019s claims were frivolous, and we are extremely pleased that the court rejected all of VPX\u2019s claims while vindicating Monster\u2019s rights. As other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today\u2019s call. Our new product introductions in the United States in the first half of 2021 were primarily focused in the first quarter. In the United States, during the second quarter of 2021, we refreshed our can graphics on our Rehab Monster brand family as well as our Full Throttle line, also updating the name for Blue Agave to TrueBlue. Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta received a refresh and updated can graphics as well as the name change to Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Manga. In May 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta in a 24-ounce option with an update to our Ultra Fiesta Manga plan for later this year. We are in the process of launching a new line of non-alcoholic pure energy sales under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which contained an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. True North is being offered in six flavors, Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Lemonade, Water Mellon Mist, White Peach Pear and Mandarin Yuzu. True North has a limited customer target in 2021 with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. While cognizant of the can shortages, we believe that it is important to continue with our innovation plans. And to this end, we will be launching our new flavors reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in Water Mellon and White Pineapple in October 2021. We have deferred the launch of our new line of Java Monster Cold Brew Coffee+ energy drinks until early 2022. In Canada, during the second quarter, we launched two new products : Monster Punch Papillon and Monster Punch Khaotic, both in a 473 ml can. In April 2021, we launched Reign Orange Dreamsicle in Puerto Rico and our second SKU in Bolivia with Monster Energy Zero Ultra. In El Salvador, we launched Fury Mean Green in May 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, we launched Juice Monster Pacific Punch and Monarch in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Paradise and Ultra Fiesta in a number of countries during the quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our strategic brand innovation and Predator in additional countries. In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with one chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Superfuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors. During the 2021 second quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we effected the relaunch at retail of Ultra Paradise and began shipments in anticipation of the launch of Super Fuel early in the 2021 third quarter. Super Fuel has just gone on the shelves in Japan this week. We also launched Mango Loco in Korea in July 2021. During the 2021 second quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. We also began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter of 2021, in China, we extended the national rollout of our new Monster Dragon Gold, which is non-carbonated. Our national summer on-pack promotion began in May with one of China\u2019s top consumer ambassadors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our planned launches and innovation of new products in a number of Asia-Pacific markets have been deferred for a few months. However, we still anticipate such launches taking place toward the end of the 2021 calendar year. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. We estimate that July 2021 sales to be approximately 1.8% higher than in July 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2021 sales would have been comparable to the July 2020 sales. July 2021 had one less selling day than July 2020, which was 15.8% above July 2019, and which was 17.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Certain production facilities, mainly from the Coke bottlers in EMEA, in particular, delayed production from July to August 2021. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the company has not been able to fully satisfy demand in the United States and EMEA due to a shortage of aluminum cans, which adversely impacted July sales. Such shortage was exacerbated in July as can availability did not keep pace with increased demand during the summer months. Additional cans have been sourced from domestic and overseas suppliers with expected deliveries increasing sequentially during the latter half of the year. We are working to replenish system inventories in order to meet customer demand as soon as possible. Additionally, the company also experienced delays in certain ingredients, which impacted supply. Our depletions remain solid as do our measured market data, as previously mentioned on this call. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company\u2019s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses, and shipment facilities, and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy drinks in a number of international countries during the year. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Rodney Sacks : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Great top line growth in the quarter, but we have seen share losses in U.S. track channel data worsened recently. A, just short-term, how much of that do you think is attributable to out of stocks and the supply constraints that you mentioned? Is that a material factor in retail sales? And then maybe, B, from a longer-term standpoint, it has been a couple of quarters now where the share losses have reaccelerated year-over-year, just some progress in the beginning of the year. So, I was just hoping you could review some of the key factors that have been driving the share losses in the U.S.? And how you think about those factors going forward in terms of continuing or dissipating and how you guys are positioned? Thanks. Rodney Sacks : Hilton, if you take that, and I\u2019ll also say something once you\u2019ve\u2026 Hilton Schlosberg : All right. I think, Dara, what\u2019s important is that, that\u2019s not a result and not due to us not growing. We are not keeping up with our share, but our business is certainly growing. And you can track that from Nielsen. You can also track that from the non-measured channels, which are growing really very nicely. So while we\u2019re not keeping up necessarily with Red Bull in the major channels. As I\u2019ve spoken on previous calls, Red Bull had a very large on-premise business, which has moved to off-premise and moved to off-premise during COVID. And that led to an acceleration in their share. However, we mentioned that we had and are continuing to sustain can issues and result in supply. And of course, that\u2019s having an impact on the share numbers that you are seeing. So I think on balance, the business is growing. You\u2019ve seen the results. It\u2019s continuing to grow. And we are growing, but not at the extent of the market. I think with the full deck of cards, the situation may well be very different. But right now, we really are struggling with sufficient supplies of aluminum cans really to keep up with demand, which is, I suppose, a good position to be in. And on the other hand, is not such a good position to be in. The business is growing. And, that\u2019s the message I want to leave you with and other investors. Rodney Sacks : I think in \u2013 I\u2019ll just add two short points in that regard. I think what we\u2019ve tried to do is to try and also basically focus on our faster selling and our larger SKUs, which has necessarily resulted in some of the smaller SKUs, which normally have their own traction and followers. So those haven\u2019t got on to shelf. And then the one additional thing that I think that has negatively affected our distribution sales and distribution levels in the U.S. is labor shortages. And I think that what we\u2019ve seen is that many of the bottlers, Coke bottlers are experiencing labor shortages. And while one would ordinarily say, well, everybody is going to have the same problem. I think that where you have Red Bull is our main competitor, they have a dedicated system. I think they\u2019ve been able to address their labor shortages just more effectively than the larger bottlers with large labor pools. And that has also, I think, detrimentally affected our distribution levels going forward. But again, I think those are things that once things start settling down and things will get back to normality, that\u2019s something that I think that will also, in due course, right itself. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes, I think we should also \u2013 Dara, I think we should also add that what we\u2019re seeing with cans is something that will persist through this year. I\u2019m a bit more optimistic about the fourth quarter because we have two new can suppliers coming on board. But the situation will persist. And then make sure, we should be in \u2013 we believe we\u2019ll be in very good shape. But again, it all depends on consumer demand, which is growing, and you\u2019ve seen that month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter. Operator : And the next question today will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Hi, everyone. I just wanted to ask about your gross margins. Clearly, they continue to be pressured as broadly expected, which you guys have been discussing with us. But just want to get your outlook for these pressures in the back half of the year? Hilton, you just mentioned that you\u2019re optimistic. So just wanted to verify that you still expect some of these pressures to ease by Q4? Or do you think it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer, especially in light of the recent spike in aluminum prices. So trying to understand how that factors in? And then just a clarification on the can shortages that you mentioned that you\u2019re still experiencing, I guess, it sounds like it\u2019s getting worse, but I really did want to clarify that. And is there any way that you guys could quantify how big of an impact the supply shortages had on your top-line either in the quarter or in July? Just trying to understand how much you think your shipments would have been up in July without these shortages, for instance? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So let me deal with the first issue first, if I may. I spoke about optimistic about can supplies. I really didn\u2019t talk about margins. You\u2019ll recall on the last call, I spoke about the issues that we were confronting with margin pressures like most other beverage companies. And where we are right now with aluminum, I mean, nobody knows. So you can talk to the leading banks in the field, which we do on a regular basis, and they really are pulls apart about their projections for aluminum in 2022, let alone 2021. So the last couple of days, you\u2019ve seen a spike in the Midwest premium from this tax that is expected to be imposed on Russian aluminum. And as you know, the Midwest premium is strongly factors the last ton of aluminum to enter the U.S. and the cost of that. And so we\u2019ve seen a spike in the Midwest premium. And we continue to see spikes in aluminum. So from that score, I think we just are in uncharted territory. I\u2019ve been in this business for a long time, as you know, and I\u2019ve never seen aluminum where it\u2019s at right now. And I\u2019ve never seen the Midwest premium at these kind of levels. So aluminum, I really cannot talk about. And also when you look at our business and you look at the factors that really have affected gross margin, number one, the fact that we\u2019re selling a lot more internationally. So I talked earlier about 37.4% of our sales in the quarter outside of the U.S. 30% last year, that obviously impacts margins. We are importing cans from a number of countries that obviously impacts margins. In fact, the China and India cans that we are using in the United States and in EMEA will only be filed in August and July, and they will be filled this month, so that in itself, the imputation will impact gross margins. And then to cap everything else, we have ingredient issues. We had ingredient issues, as we mentioned, in July, which again reduced the amount that we would actually sell because we didn\u2019t have sufficient ingredients to meet themselves, particularly with NOS. And so there are a number of factors that are increasing our cost of goods. And last quarter, I said I didn\u2019t think that margins would get better in the second and third quarters. I read they will not \u2013 I think margins will deteriorate in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019re getting some relief in terms of supplies from the U.S. on cans that are \u2013 have been contracted for and they were contracted for two years ago. And we saw the opportunity to work with two major suppliers to get additional cans produced in the U.S., and that\u2019s why we have two new supplies opening, and we are an important and an anchor customer of both those facilities. But even that, you\u2019re still dependent on aluminum. We have some hedges in place, but obviously not enough to take into consideration the amount of sales and the amount of consumer demand that is out there. So that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying, I think, answering your question and as best as I can. And then just getting to your second question, because you\u2019re really only allowed one, but to get to your second question, we have quantified or try to quantify the impact on can shortages in July and in this quarter and in the \u2013 potentially in the third quarter, but I really don\u2019t want to \u2013 I\u2019m not comfortable with those numbers yet. A lot of detailed work is being done on them. And I just \u2013 I can\u2019t in good contents give those numbers because we still are in the throes of kind of finalizing what we think is probably correct. Rodney mentioned in his script earlier that a number of the bottlers, he mentioned particularly in EMEA, but there were cases in the U.S. as well, and there was a substantial case in the U.S. where the bottlers were obviously focused on other things in the quarter and were producing Coca-Cola brands. And as a result, I think we \u2013 our production got moved from July to August, so when I look at July, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t get overly concerned because I know the sales are going into August. Rodney Sacks : Perhaps, if I just on the shortage level, just to add that when we buy cans in contracted for our annual amount, they usually are sort of reasonably flat line across the year. And we used the first half of the year to build up can inventories and finished product inventories with ourselves and our bottlers. Earlier this year, obviously, demand sort of was strong, and so we really didn\u2019t have that opportunity. So what has happened is that in June and July, which is your normal peak months, the demand has been higher, but our supply has been more level until we can get more can inventories into the market. So what happened is just that we have had a sort of a heartened increased shortage in the last month and July and probably will be a little bit in August. And then obviously, as we start increasing our \u2013 the cans we\u2019re getting in, and then we\u2019re able to balance it more and our demand balances more, we\u2019ll start to have less of a different delta between these demand and supplier and eventually be able to \u2013 we\u2019re hoping to able to build up our inventories and supply back to normal by the end of the fourth quarter or during or by the end of the fourth quarter. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. No one\u2019s comfortable with the level of finished goods inventories that we\u2019re running at, but it\u2019s a sign of the times. I mean, we\u2019re doing everything we can to supply our customers. And that\u2019s why we spoke about freights. Freight is a big issue, not only getting raw material ingredients into co-packing system and into our bottling system and \u2013 but also distributing from our co-packers. And obviously, the one goes into cost of sales and freight out goes into operating expenses. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see freight really hitting both of those line items. Operator : The next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon. Rodney Sacks : Hi. Hilton Schlosberg : Hi, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : How are you Hilton? Hi. Hilton Schlosberg : I\u2019m good. Andrea Teixeira : Yes. Just on the gross margin, because your gross margin comments were very helpful and given this deterioration obviously that its probably here to stay in the next few quarters. How are you thinking about pricing? Obviously, you can\u2019t supply the service levels that are used to with the retailers. So is that is something that takes \u2013 obviously, you have to take into account? Or perhaps as you get more informed on how the aluminum cost will evolve, you may contemplate it again? Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. With regard to pricing, we continue to evaluate pricing, honestly, on a very, very regular basis, if not weekly. So we continue to evaluate it, and we want to make a good decision. Last time around, as I mentioned on previous calls, we went out alone, and we would like to have been in a situation this time where we followed our competitor, but we have to evaluate, obviously, the business as we see it and the impact for us. What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re reducing our promotional allowances. So we\u2019re taking a price increase the other way, through reducing promotional allowances, but the impact of that reduction in the second quarter was not as we would have liked. So we are \u2013 we really put the accelerator down and are more aggressive in reducing our promotional allowances. But we are continuing to evaluate the pricing and price increases. And then I have to leave this call with my favorite saying, and that is, we don\u2019t bank gross profit margins, we bank gross profit dollars. And to me, the fact that we\u2019re doing everything we can to satisfy our customers as best as we can is impacting gross profit margins. But at the end of the day, we don\u2019t want to lose gross profit dollars, which is really important to ensure the sustainability of the brand and that\u2019s the most important thing for us right now. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. That\u2019s fair. Thank you, both. Rodney Sacks : Yes. Basically, just make it clear, at this point, we are watching and we\u2019re not planning a price increase. So we\u2019re not adverse to a price, but we\u2019ll wait and see what the market does and what our competitors do. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Rodney. Operator : This will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks very much. Thank you, everyone, for your continued interest and support of the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy to remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both domestically and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the near future. We believe that we are well-positioned in the energy drink category and will continue to be and are optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from supplies in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However the company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter. In addition, the company continued to experience additional supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, trucking availability, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, insufficient co-packing capacity and delays in receiving certain ingredients in the United States and EMEA. As a result the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand in the United States and EMEA in the 2021 third quarter.  During the 2021 third quarter, the company continued to experience increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing and costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition the company experienced increased ingredient and import costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, all of which resulted an increased cost of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 third quarter.  The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain, as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory, and we have and are in the process of implementing reductions and promotions, and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs.  In the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.41 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 13.2%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 third quarter would have been up 11.9%.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 third quarter was 55.9% compared with 59.1% in the 2020 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily the result of increased aluminum can costs, attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans, logistical costs and geographical sales mix. Operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were $344.7 million compared to $277.9 million in the 2020 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were 24.4% compared to 22.3% in the 2020 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID.  In particular, operating costs were adversely affected by increased logistical inefficiencies, including higher freight-out and warehousing costs, a one-time distributor termination fee of $5.3 million and increased selling and marketing expenses, including the resumption of certain sponsorship and deviant activities as compared to the same quarter last year. A number of sponsorship activities were canceled in the comparable quarter last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Operating income increased 3.1% to $444.5 million from $458.6 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased import costs, increased transportation, increased selling expenses and a one-time distributor termination fee of $5.3 million. Net income decreased 3% to $337.2 million as compared to $347.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter.  Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 third quarter decreased 3.5% to $0.63 from $0.65 in the third quarter of 2020. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 23, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 12.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company\u2019s energy brands, including Reign were up 7.1% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster were up 10.7%. Sales of Reign were down 7.6%. Sales of NOS decreased 18.3% and sales of Full Throttle increased 8.9%. It is important to note that with regard to the decrease in sales of NOS, during the third quarter we experienced shortages in the supply of concentrate for NOS, which resulted in reduced production, reduced sales and lack of product availability at retail. The NOS supply issues are improving. Sales of Red Bull increased 15.6%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 12.5%, and sales of 5-Hour increased 3%. VPX Bang sales increased 5.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 23, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 8.8% over the same period the previous year.

Rockstar\u2019s share was down 1 point to 3.8%; 5-Hour share was lower by 0.3 of a point at 4.6%. VPX Bang share decreased 0.4 of a point to 7.4%. As previously reported, Coca-Cola Energy is being discontinued in the United States and Canada by the end of 2021. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 23, 2021, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel, increased 1.3% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 were 7.1% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 0.5% lower. Java Monster share including Java Monster 300 of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended October 23, 2021 was 52.6% up 2.9 points, while Starbucks\u2019 energy share was 44.5%, down 0.3 points. According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon in the United States, for the four-week period ending October 2, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots increased to 39.9% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Monster increased 18.9%, and its share was 27.2%, down 4.8 share points versus the same period a year ago. Red Bull sales increased 41.4% and its share was 15.7%, up 0.2 points. Celsius\u2019 sales increased 95.2%, and its share increased 5.5 points to 19.4%. 5-Hour sales increased 0.5% and its share declined 1.1 points to 2.9%. VPX Bang sales increased 36.6% and its share increased 0.1 share points to 5.6%. Reign\u2019s share decreased 0.2 of a share point to 4.8% and Rockstar\u2019s share increased 1.7 share points to 5.2%. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended October 9, 2021, the energy drink category increased 10.5% in dollars. Sales of the company\u2019s energy drink brands increased 13.3% versus a year ago. The market share of the company\u2019s energy drink brands was 41.3%, up 1 point. Monster sales increased 14.4%, and its market share increased 1.2 points to 36.2%.  NOS\u2019 sales increased 1%, and its market share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.7%. Full Throttle sales decreased 5.9%, and its market share remained at 0.7 of a percent. Red Bull sales increased 11.9%, and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 39.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 1.2%, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 11.5%. GURU\u2019s sales increased 21.5%, and its share increased 0.4 of a share point to 3.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 26.6% for the month of September 2021. Monster sales increased 15.7%. Monster\u2019s market share in value decreased 2.5 points to 26.2% against the comparable period the previous year.  Sales of Predator, which was launched in March 2020 increased 95.1% and its market share increased 1 share point to 2.8%. Red Bull sales increased 17.6%, and its market share decreased by 0.5 a point to 6.1%. Vive 100 sales increased 7.6%, and its market share decreased by 3.3 points to 19%. Volt\u2019s sales increased 34.2%, and its market share increased 1.1 share points to 19.5%, while Boost\u2019s sales increased 12.8%, and its market share decreased 0.7 points to 5.3%. Amp\u2019s sales increased 55.5%, and its market share increased 3.4 points to 18.2%.  The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO circle convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2021 compared to September 2020, Monster\u2019s retail market share in-value increased in Argentina from 44.2% to 47.6%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased in Brazil, from 33% to 37.6% and now trails Red Bull by only 3.3 points. In Chile, although Monster\u2019s net sales in the third quarter was 34% higher, its retail market share for the month of September decreased from 46.6% to 42.2%, due to robust growth in the energy category in Chile, which has growing 65% for the month of September 2021. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 10, 2021, Monster\u2019s regional market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.5% to 13.6%; in Belgium, from 25.8% to 26.3% in France, from 25.4% to 29% in Great Britain, from 7.5% to 7.7% in the Netherlands, and from 35.8% to 36.7% in Spain.  According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of September 2021, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.2% to 14.9% in Germany, from 37% to 38.6% in Greece and from 18.3% to 20.2% in South Africa. Monster\u2019s retail market share in value is compared to the same period the previous year declined from 20.1% to 19.5% in Poland. According to Nielsen, for the 13-week period ending September 12, 2021, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 25.4% to 27.3% in Denmark, from 26.2% to 27.5% in the Republic of Ireland and from 13.3% to 13.6% in Sweden.  Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 27.1% to 22% in Norway. According to Nielson in the 13-week period ending August 31, 2021 Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13% to 14.6% in the Czech Republic, and from 19.9% to 29.1% in Italy.  In the 2021 third quarter, sales in EMEA were adversely impacted by can and concentrate supply issues and manufacturing capacity constraints, which caused out-of-stocks in many markets. The United Kingdom and certain other countries in EMEA were more adversely affected. Truck shortages also exacerbated our ability to supply and the ability of our bottlers to deliver products to their customers. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period until the end of August 2021, Predator\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 9.8% to 18.6% in Kenya and from 0% to 12.2% in Nigeria. We launched our new Predator malt flavor energy drink in Nigeria during the third quarter. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster\u2019s market share in value for the month ending October 2021 increased from 12.7% to 13.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother\u2019s market share in value decreased from 11.9% to 11.3% during the same period. The market share of the company\u2019s brands in Australia for the month ended October 2021 increased from 24.6% to 25.2%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster\u2019s market share in value for the four weeks ended October 17, 2021, increased from 10.6% to 12.6% as compared to the same period of the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 6.7% to 6.3%, and Mother\u2019s market share in value increased from 5.6% to 6.1%. The market share of the company\u2019s brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended October 17, 2021, increased from 23% to 25%. According to INTAGE, in Japan, for the month ended September 21, 2021 Monster\u2019s market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 49.9% to 53.9%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, for the month ended September 21, 2021, Monster\u2019s market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 54.4% to 60.4%. Monster continues to be the leading energy brand in Japan and South Korea.  We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were $527.4 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 third quarter compared to $444.5 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020.  Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $16.4 million in the 2021 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 22.9% in dollars and increased 17.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 37.7% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to an unfavorable country product mix and canned freight and raw material air freight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.4%.  Can supply shortages exacerbated by production disruptions at a major supplier in EMEA, lack of ingredient availability, insufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability, together had an adverse impact on sales in the third quarter in EMEA, in some cases impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. The company has addressed and continues to address the controllable challenges in its supply trend. We are also pleased that in the 2021 third quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 1.6% in dollars and decreased 2.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.5% versus 43.2% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 0.7 of a percent in dollars and 1.7% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. In South Korea, net sales increased 21.1% in dollars and 15.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China net sales decreased 13.5% in dollars and 20.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. We are re-evaluating the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.  In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 8.6% in dollars and 13.6% in local currencies due to timing of sales into bottlers. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 57.6% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41% compared to 42.9% over the same period in 2020. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased by 56.6% in dollars and 54.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chili increased 34.5% in dollars and 27.4% in local currency in the 2021 third quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 41.6% in dollars and 93.1% in local currency in the 2021 third quarter. There are a number of pending proceedings with VPX, but as they are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this measure on today\u2019s call.  In the United States we successfully launched our new True North pure energy salsa line in ecommerce and selected channels, and will launch nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter of 2022.  In October 2021 we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of monster energy drinks in two flavors, watermelon and white pineapple. In Canada, during July 2021 we successfully launched our monster energy Rehab line in three flavors. We have Tea Plus lemonade, Peach Tea and Strawberry Lemonade. We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the third quarter of 2021, including Monster Energy Zero Ultra in Paraguay, Monster Energy Zero Sugar in Peru, Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango in Puerto Rico and Monster Ultra Watermelon in the Caribbean. In the 2021 third quarter we expanded our presence at Gold Strike footprint in Mexico by launching in a 355 ML slim can. In Brazil we also launched Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mango Magic within a limited territory. We are planning a national launch of all of these products in the first quarter of 2022.  In the 2021 third quarter in Australia we launched two new products in Mother Sugarfree Razzle Berry and Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango. In the third quarter of 2021 we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Fiesta and Juiced Monster Monarch in a number of countries during the 2021 third quarter. During the quarter we also launched our strategic brands innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator malt flavored energy drink in Nigeria. During the third quarter 2021 we launched Monster Super Fuel, Blue Streak and Red Dog in July in Japan. Additionally in October 2021 we re-launched Monster Rossi in Japan.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting the region, certain of our planned launches of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred until 2022. However, Predator is anticipated to launch later this month in Vietnam. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.  We estimate October 2021 sales to be approximately 8.3% higher than in October 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2021 sales would have been approximately 7.9% higher than the comparable October 2020 sales. October 2021 had one less selling day than October 2020.  Additionally, the company continued to experience multiple supply chain challenges in October, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production.  In some instances where our bottles are responsible for production and literally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.  In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory and we have and are already in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs.  Our AFA flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region, which would improve service levels in the EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the monster energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries.  We are pleased with the roll out of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We're proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. I\u2019d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator :  Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi! My question has to do with how you're thinking about pricing and promotion, because on the one hand you've got strong market shares, it seems like strong demand, yet you've got capacity constraints and supply chain constraints. So on the one hand you want to keep promotion up to keep people coming to your brand, but if you can't service demand how do you balance those two. If you could talk about what you are thinking about just in the short term over the next few months, how you scale up supply and get more bottles on the shelf, more cans on the shelf. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay Wendy, this is Hilton. That's an excellent question. So we have a department called Revenue Growth Management that balances pricing and balances promotions in line with the expectations that we set for the business and for our brands. So we\u2019ve been working very closely and started in this quarter, in fact slightly before this last quarter in cutting back promotions and using them very judiciously.  So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have plans for 2022 which involves changing retail pricing on shelves, which leads to obesity reduction in promotions and we don't rule out the possibility of a full price increase later on in 2022. But we keep our options open. We prefer to accomplish the objectives through reductions in promotions, but we have to see what the cost environment looks like going into the 2022.  Obviously if you haven't got product and you showed a product that doesn't make sense to promote extensively, but we still have to promote in order to fulfill the contract that we've had this year with our customers and our retailers which was set at the beginning of the and so some cannot be changed and as we move into 2020, adjust pricing through promotions and/or price increases. Operator : The question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : Alright, thank you. Hi Rodney and Hilton! Hilton Schlosberg : Hey Bonnie! Tom Kelly : Hey Bonnie! Bonnie Herzog : Hi! I wanted to ask a little bit further on the points you're making about this, outsized demand and that you weren't able to satisfy this increased demand in the quarter and given the shortages. So is there any you guys could help quantify for us the impact that this had on you top line in both the U.S. and EMEA. I mean I'm just trying to understand is that, you know was it a low single digit impact on growth? Could it have been more like a mid-single digit improvement on your top online. Hilton Schlosberg : No, no. Is it one question or two? Bonnie Herzog : Okay, well that\u2019s it. I just want to also understand if the situations improved in Q3 versus Q2. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay, so the situations did not improve in Q3 relative to Q2. Q3 really presented more challenges in supply chain as we anticipated. Although cans have come, we've achieved cans from overseas partners as we expected. So we have cans in the system, we have opened up a number of co-packers in the \u2013 which will be supplying in the fourth quarter. So if we look at Q3 and Rodney will probably kill me, but I\u2019ll give you an estimate. My estimate is that we shorted in the high single digits; that's my estimate, in terms of millions of cases. Operator : The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hey guys! Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering Hilton, you know the comments on other pricing actions, you know retail pricing on shelves, potential for a full list price increase. Just can you give us a sense on maybe when you would consider that more thoroughly? Is there a reason why it's not now, is there a shelf reset period that you need to wait for. Just, you know listening to some of the commentary from some of the bottlers, it seems like they are taking pricing now. Just why wait? Hilton Schlosberg : So we are not waiting. I mean we already implemented promotional adjustments in this quarter, so we are not waiting. There are certain customers that we have, that we are contractually obligated to maintain pricing and promotions. We've entered into agreements with them that we have new contracts starting in 2022, and those new contracts will address the pricing issues that you're talking about.  So we are not waiting. It's already being implemented and some of it in the third quarter as I mentioned, more will fall in the fourth quarter and more will follow in Q1 of 2022. I think we've got a very interesting position in the market and we've got to be careful that whatever we do, we don't disturb the velocity of what our brand is doing at retail. Operator : The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, hey! Good afternoon guys. Hope all's well. I wanted to ask about the Coke relationship. So the can supply shortages, some of the manufacturing challenges that you've laid out in recent quarters, assuming distribution disadvantaged verses Red Bull self-distribution at least in the U.S., how do you think about your relationship with Coke, and importantly how does it get better and what makes it better from here. Hilton Schlosberg : Mark, perhaps I\u2019ll take that one. I mean there are two different relationships, there is Coke as a corporate partner, and there's also the individual Coke bottlers. You know I think that our relationship with Coke is fine. I think there is no issue, it\u2019s a good relationship.  I think that with the bottles are relationships again are also good. But I think the bottles have been struggling a little bit as you know with labor issues and cost issues as well. And that has sort of affected I think the level of service to smaller accounts and in field activities and that's why that has perhaps disproportionately hurt our brand over this whole pandemic period and that\u2019s something that we are addressing, particularly when you compare that to, not against other similarly - similar systems, but as against Red Bull which has its own dedicated system out there. And so we are taking steps to address that. We have our home fields\u2019 force that we've implemented to supplement and assist the bottlers. We even had fuel filed forces suffering from labor issues and trying to hire people. It's not been easy, we have a number of open positions. But we are, actually we\u2019ve seen good success from what we've implemented and we actually are expanding on filed team and we are going to do that in conjunction with the bottlers. But that\u2019s part of the challenges we've had in our supply chain and part of the challenges we've had which has affected our sales, have been you know just inefficiencies getting products on shelf. And there are different, different parts of the country and different parts of the world even, it varies and in some cases you see empty shelves or you see shelves that haven\u2019t been refilled, which is obviously heart breaking for us and we try and address it. But that is something we are facing and that's been a labor issue that many of our bottlers are going through at the moment. But hopefully we are trying to work out ways of improving and hopefully that will start improving going forward.  But despite that, we've been able to continue to manage pretty healthy increase in sales and it's the, it\u2019s just meeting the increased demand that has been our big challenge. And again, we are working with our bottles to try to achieve what we can.  So a tough environment for our bottlers, when also we can\u2019t supply all of their orders and fill them in full, and that\u2019s been difficult for us to juggle deliveries around the country, and it resulted in increased costs out of orbit and in delivering products out of our normal ranges in order to make sure we are trying to maximize deliveries to bottlers. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon there. I wanted to just go back to the magnitude of pricing in your comments in the last earnings call. That you expect the cost pressures and supply challenge to abate in the fourth quarter. Are you still expecting that to be the case or sequentially quite worse and we should brace for something similar in the fourth quarter against the third quarter.  And just for clarification, you said high single digit million cases impact or you said high single digit percentage impact that would have been? Hilton Schlosberg : No, no, no million cases. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, that\u2019s a mid-single digit impact, okay. Hilton Schlosberg : No, well in cases it\u2019s a high, just to be clear it's a high number of cases in millions, in the high single digits. Andrea Teixeira : And on the pricing Hilton, can you let us know the magnitude that you're trying to put through and how we should think about cogs into the fourth quarter. Hilton Schlosberg : Right, so if you look at where we are with cogs, it\u2019s really a difficult situation right now, because I don't know where for example aluminum is going. I think those of you who are tracking aluminum, will know that the aluminum price is significantly, the LME and the Midwest premium is significantly higher than last year. In fact it's up by almost 70% from the - from the similar quarter in the previous year.  So and then I\u2019ll turn to what's happened in aluminum. So in the middle of October we ended up with the highest price we've ever seen for aluminum in the Midwest Premium and that's now fallen 15% from its high and now it\u2019s like the end of October.  So we don't know what's happening with aluminum. What we do know is that we have substantial quantities of cans; we have two new manufactures that have opened in the U.S. and are beginning to supply us. So that's a fact and we have also opened a number of additional co-packing facilities both in the U.S. and in Europe.  So the cans are coming in, we have new co-packing capacity and what I'm hoping is that this inefficient freight that we've been experiencing, you know we spoke on previous calls about operating within orbits to minimize cost of distribution and cost of freight in. So now we've broken those orbits, because we haven't had capacity and we've been anxiously trying to service every case we can. So I'm hoping that in the fourth quarter and it's October really, that with these new co-packers opening up, that with the can capacity that we have, that we will start mitigating these inefficient freight costs that we are experiencing. But you know I can't talk about aluminum, because I don't know what's happening with aluminum and we were very careful not to buy forward on aluminum which, we normally do as our can companies, because we were nervous about what was going to happen. So that's where we are in the fourth quarter.  Certainly things are improving, but I cannot say that they are totally solved. And in Europe we've opened up also a number of new co-packers. We\u2019re getting cans in Europe from India and from China, so even the European situation is being elevated. I would say if you compare it to the third quarter, I suspect we will have less issues in the fourth quarter than we have had in the third quarter, if that answers your question. : Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of the company I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular expend distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.  We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year net sales with annual net sales topping the $5.5 billion mark for the first time in the company's history. Despite certain challenges in the 2021 fourth quarter, the company achieved solid results overall. We note that the comparative 2020 fourth quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $165.1 million as well as reduced marketing, sponsorships and certain other operating expenses, largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These items should be taken into consideration when evaluating comparative performance over the 2020 fourth year and full year, -- fourth quarter and full year. During the 2021 fourth quarter, the company continued to procure additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States and abroad in response to increased consumer demand. In addition, the company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion and delays in the receipt of certain ingredients. In the United States, the company lacked sufficient co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of its products. As a result, the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand for its products in a number of markets in the 2021 fourth quarter. During the 2021 fourth quarter, the company experienced increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans. In addition, the company experienced increased ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, increased outbound freight costs and production and efficiencies, which resulted in increased costs of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 fourth quarter. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.43 billion compared with $1.20 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 19.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter would have been up 19.3%. The comparative net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to prior returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and labeling issue concerning 1 product in Japan, which we will refer to as the 2020 product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter was 53.9% compared with 57.7% in the 2020 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of increased freighting costs, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, geographical and product sales mix and production inefficiencies. Operating expenses for the 2021 fourth quarter were $334.7 million compared with $288.4 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 fourth quarter were 24.9% compared with 24.1% in the 2020 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased outbound freight and warehouse costs, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for other marketing activities including social media and digital marketing and increased payroll costs. During the comparative 2020 fourth quarter, the company decreased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on our sales and marketing programs during the 2021 fourth quarter. Distribution costs for the 2021 fourth quarter increased to $69.8 million, which is an increase of 48.4% or 4.9% of net sales compared to $47 million or 3.9% of net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter. Operating income increased 2.6% to $412.9 million from $402.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe that a portion of the increase in costs that we experienced in the quarter and the 2021 full year are likely to be transitory. With our 2 new suppliers of aluminum cans in the United States operational, we will begin to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminum cans in the United States, although we will continue to import aluminum cans into the United States, although at a reduced level in the first half of 2022. In 2022, we expect to continue to import aluminum cans into EMEA reducing such imports in the second half of 2022. The supply chain challenges we are experiencing are significantly increasing and the logistic costs of importing and shipping raw materials and ingredients as well as other freighting costs, which are included in cost of sales. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. We are rebuilding and increasing inventories in an effort to reduce the excessive cost of trucking long distances to satisfy demand and to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing in proximity to our customers. Increased freight in costs, including the shipment cost of importing cans amounted to approximately $38 million in the 2021 fourth quarter and approximately $100 million for the 2021 full year. Our out-of-orbit freight costs, which are included in distribution expenses amounted to approximately $15 million in the 2021 fourth quarter and $54 million for the 2021 full year. Net income decreased 31.9% to $321.3 million as compared to $471.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by the recognition of a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million. Net income for the comparative 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the nonrecurring tax benefits, the impact of the 2020 product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was $328.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 fourth quarter decreased 32.1% to $0.60 from $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the comparative 2020 fourth quarter excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the 2020 product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was $0.62.

Sales of Red Bull increased 13.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 1.3% and sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1%. Sales of VPX Bang increased 0.4%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 1, 2022, and sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 7.4% over the same period the previous year.

Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 were 4.2% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 0.7 of a percent higher. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300 of the coffee -- plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee, for the 4 weeks ended February 12, 2021, was 53.7%, up 1 point, while Starbucks Energy share was 44.1%, down 0.7 of a point.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 25.9% for the month of January 2022. Monster sales increased 24.5%. Monster's market share in value decreased 0.3 points to 27.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 38.3% and its market share increased 0.3 of a share point to 3.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of January 2022 compared to January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 41.3% to 43.8%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. According to Nielsen, for the month of January 2022 compared to January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 32.2% to 37.8%. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of January 2022 decreased from 47.2% to 33.1% due to a shortage of shipping containers. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. In addition, the company experienced supply issues in EMEA during 2021, which impacted the Nielsen statistics in different countries. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 29, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 27.3% to 29.5% in Great Britain, from 7.9% to 8.1% in the Netherlands and from 36.8% to 38.4% in Spain.

Monster continues to be the leading energy brand in Japan and South Korea. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $508.1 million, which is 35.7% of total net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to $384.8 million or 32.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $2.4 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 47.5% in dollars and increased 46.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Net sales adjusted for the 2020 product returns in this region increased 41.2% in dollars and increased 39.9% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 32.6% compared to 30.2% in the same quarter in 2020. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was impacted by can freight and raw material airfreight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 32.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the 2020 product returns in this region associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 40.1% for the 2020 fourth quarter. In 2021 fourth quarter, can supply shortages, lack of ingredient availability, it's sufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability together had an adverse impact on sales in EMEA. In some cases, impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. However, the shortages of trucking availability will largely resolve in the latter part of the quarter. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA by continuing to import cans and expanding its co-packing capacity. We are also pleased that in the 2021 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 19.2% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. In Asia Pacific, excluding the impact of the 2020 product returns and the labeling issue in this region in the 2020 fourth quarter, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 10.7% in dollars and 14.1% in local currency over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41.4% versus 34.8% over the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of the 2020 product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and related costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.3% in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 12.7% in dollars and 20% in local currency. Without the impact of the 2020, product returns in Japan net sales decreased 1.2% in dollars and increased 5.2% in local currency over the same period in 2020, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 31.3% in dollars and 35.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales increased 22.6% in dollars and 17.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. We are reevaluating the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 7.5% in dollars and 4.8% in local currencies due to timing of sales into bottlers.

There are a number of pending proceedings with VPX but as they are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, we launched our new True North Pure Energy Seltzer line in e-commerce and selected natural channels in the third quarter. In early 2022, we launched this said line nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers. In October 2021, we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in 2 flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple. We have launched multiple innovation SKUs, 2 new 12-ounce flavors as well as new package configurations in the 2022 first quarter. This month, we launched 4 new flavor extensions in 16-ounce cans to the retail trade, namely Ultra Peachy Keen, Juice Monster Aussie Star Lemonade, Rehab Watermelon and Reign Rainbow Sherbet. In January 2022, we launched additional multipack options, such as 4-pack, Ultra Watermelon, a 4-pack Reign White Gummy Bear, 2 Ultra Variety packages in a 12-pack format. Additionally, we have launched 12-ounce 6 packs of Monster Energy, Zero Ultra, our new Peachy Keen Ultra, Java Monster Mean Bean and Java Monster Loca Mocha, Ultra Peachy Keen also launching in a 12-ounce option along with our Ultra Watermelon. In addition, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew is scheduled to launch in the 2022 second quarter with 2 lower-calorie SKUs, Sweet Black and Latte. In the 2022 first quarter in Canada, we are planning to launch 9 new innovations, including the transition into a 355 ml 8-pack for Monster Energy, Zero Ultra and Ultra Paradise. In January 2022, we launched Ultra Gold in a 473 ml single can and 4-pack. We also launched Ultra Watermelon in a 4-pack and Ultra Paradise in a 710 ml can. We are in the process of launching a 4-pack Reign of Raspberry as well as introducing Reign White Gummy Bear in a 473 ml can. In the 2021 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Mango Loco in Uruguay and Ecuador as well as Monster Ultra Watermelon and Predator Gold Strike in Trinidad. In Honduras, we expanded our Fury package offerings with the 355 mL returnable glass bottle. We are planning a national launch of Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign, Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mango Magic in Brazil in the first half of 2022. Additional 2022 first quarter LatAm innovations include Monster Zero Sugar in Ecuador, Pipeline Punch in Central America and Trinidad Monster Mango Loco in Peru and Colombia and VR46, the doctor in Argentina. In Chile, we are launching Reign Melon Mania, Reign Lemon Heads and Reign Orange Dreamsicle. In Mexico, we will introduce our second predator flavor with Predator Mean Green. In the 2021 fourth quarter in New Zealand, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango. In the 2022 first quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Gold and Mother Kiwi Sublime in Australia and are planning to launch Super Fuel Tropical Thunder in New Zealand. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Green, Monster Nitro and Monster Result in a number of countries. We also launched Ultra Watermelon, Golden Paradise and Juice Monarch Mango Loca and Pacific Punch in a number of countries during the 2021 fourth quarter. Monster Super Fuel Mean Green Watermelon and Subzero were launched in 2 countries in the fourth quarter of 2021. During the 2021 fourth quarter and 2022 first quarter, we also launched our Strategic Brands innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator Spicy Ginger and Tropical in South Africa. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Rose in Japan in October, and the Predator brand in Vietnam in November 2021. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the course of 2022. We are planning to launch a number of additional products or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. On February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective, a craft beer and hard sales for company for $330 million in cash subject to adjustments. The transaction brings the Cigar City, Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA, Oskar Blues, Dale's Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzer, Deep Ellum, Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA, Perrin Brewing, Black Ale, Squatters, Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA and Wasatch, Apricot Hefeweizen brands to our beverage portfolio. The transaction does not include CANarchy stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. CANarchy will function independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that this acquisition presents to us in the alcohol space and through their distribution network. We estimate January 2022 sales to be approximately 20.2% higher than in January 2021. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January '22 sales would have been approximately 23% higher than the comparable January 2021 sales. January 2022 had 1 more selling day than in January 2021. Although we see some improvement, the company has continued to experience supply chain challenges in January, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are continuing to experience increased costs in our operations, some of which may be transitory, and we have and are in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate against such increased costs. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region and will improve service levels in EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. Our supply chain challenges are improving. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that CANarchy presents. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Thank you operator. Hey everybody. You talked a lot about improved supply and the things you're doing to increase supply. Your margins obviously were down quite a bit, I think, 540 basis points. Speaking -- can you speak maybe more to margins as opposed to just availability of product and how we should be thinking about that within the context of some of the changes that are being made for '22? Hilton Schlosberg : Well, Kaumil, I think that we've been through enlisted the supply chain challenges. And I'm not sure it's worthwhile repeating what we said earlier. But what we did mention on the call and gave some numbers was that the -- certain of those costs in the supply chain are expected to be transitory. And that is, for example, we do satisfy demand, we opened up what we regarded as orbits where we manufactured and distributed within specific geographies. And to satisfy demand, we had to open up those orbits. And the cost of that was pretty exceptional. And we detailed that, I think, on this call. Also to import cans from abroad is a very expensive exercise, as you can imagine. And that we see kind of mitigating in 2022. We have 2 new suppliers coming on stream and they aren't -- in fact, they are on stream. So we will be reducing our dependence on imported cans certainly in the U.S., and then we'll buy some cans, not to the same degree as we did in the first half. And the second half will be -- we believe we'll be self-sufficient with cans in the U.S. In EMEA, we'll continue to input cans, but they will kind of tail off in the second half of the year. So there are some of these costs that are transitory. Some of the costs may stick. There's been costs across the board, and we had a big shock this morning. As no doubt you guys did as well with aluminum, where aluminum plus the Midwest index went up to $1.97 a pound as opposed to what we were paying in last year of just kind of half of that. So there are a lot of costs that are coming to us. The cost that we can mitigate, the cost that we may not be able to mitigate. Now we'll aluminum stay at this level? I don't think anyone knows. So overall, I think we are navigating well through these supply chain challenges. And we're doing the very best we can to ensure that our customers receive product because at the end of the day, as I've always said to this audience, we bank dollars, we don't bank margins, and we have enough profitability in the system to be able to do what we've been doing and make a profit. And unfortunately, the result is that the GP percentage does come down, but we expect that this will not last forever and that margins will be back to some degree as we move forward. Operator : The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good evening everyone. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to follow up on that line. If I look at -- not to be so shortsighted in a way, but where The Street is modeling your gross margins, it's slightly up for 2022. But if I hear you right, if you have aluminum inflation still coming through, you're still going to be sourcing cans from other places. So you have freight costs. Pricing, as you noted, at the annual Investor Day, will be a positive to the story, but maybe not enough to offset this inflation. And so I just want to make sure I'm hearing right that the top line, of course, remains a very good story here, but the gross margins should remain under pressure in 2022 and then really building into 2023 as these costs are a bit transitory. And then if I could, just on the quarter-to-date number, is that mostly international versus the U.S., just given the disconnect to Nielsen sales. So thanks so much for that perspective. Hilton Schlosberg : Well, let's go back to the -- your second question. That number -- the U.S. is very close to that number for January. So we can -- we have a lot of unmeasured channels in our system, and Nielsen is not always a good indicator of our sales to our distributors. So let's go -- if we can, let's take a step back and look at your -- and address your first question. So aluminum jumped up today significantly. It's been moving up I gave you the number as of today, as of yesterday, it was $0.10 a ton less than that. So with this war and everything else going on in the world, I can't say for certain, and I don't think anyone can tell you what aluminum is going to do and what it's going to be. And obviously, with most of our products being packaged in aluminum cans that is a significant item. Looking back at some of your other comments, I mentioned that -- we mentioned at least on the script that we have sufficient cans now. So we're able to start working towards closing off and close going back to the orbits, which means that trading costs should significantly reduce. When? I can't say for certain, but it's going to happen. Other costs in the system are being controlled. And so what -- looking forward, I think that we will continue to have a difficult 2022. Will the margins stay at the level that we talked about on this call? I don't know. Honestly, a lot depends on what happens with aluminum. So the rest of the stuff is coming under control. I mentioned that we were importing less cans into the U.S. than we did in 2020. That will have a positive impact on margins from the second half of the year will be -- we believe, will be totally self-sufficient with cans in the U.S. So that's a positive factor. And then in EMEA, we will be importing cans in the first half with a significant reduction in the second half. So there's a lot of good things in the cost story, but unfortunately, it is what it is. On the sales side and price increases, we spoke about that. On previous calls, as you know, we have a play that we're running, irrespective, really, I think, of what Red Bull is doing, we've come to the conclusion that we're going to run our own play. We know what we want to do, and we're working on reducing promotional ounces. You've seen prices go up already in the trade, and you've seen them going up in Nielsen. So that is something that is happening as well. What else do I want to say? So we spoke about prices went up in the -- through reductions in promotional launches in the quarter that we look at, although at a very modest degree. And as we go through 2022, you'll see prices -- price increases in our business accelerating. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, how are you. I just wanted to perhaps elaborate more on what you said, Hilton on the pricing front. Are you saying that you -- we should be able to see pricing be on what was passed through by top manufacturing at some point in 2022? And then regarding that, are you seeing any impact from the gas stations given the gas price is going up? Or this is not a concern for affordability at this point? Hilton Schlosberg : So you've seen the convenience and gas numbers in Nielsen. They are somewhat lower than the rest of the market of recent. But we've been through higher gas prices before and they haven't really impacted sales. But we are seeing -- if you look at the Nielsen, you'll see that the numbers in convenience and gas in the energy category are reducing. So whether they'll stay at that level, I don't know. But we have been through this before, and we haven't seen a slowdown in sales and energy in the convenience and gas market. And then looking at pricing -- Rodney Sacks : Of a pickup may add -- sorry, just been a little bit of a pickup in the last week. If you look at the single last week's numbers, again, that's a very short period, but we are seeing a pickup in convenience with the price increase -- effective price increase, it still is translating. So we'll see how that extends. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes, it's a 1-week number, sure. And with regard to pricing, we spoke about what we were doing to increase pricing. We're running our play. 24 ounces going up April 1 in low double-digit numbers. So that will be a nice percentage in 24 ounce. And the rest, we're working on, as you know, with our revenue growth management department working on taking promotional allowances down to achieve the same result as a price increase. But we're continuing to monitor whether we need to take a general price increase or not. And if we have to, we will and in particular, with regard to metal, and we don't know where metal is going. But with regard to metal, if it becomes a permanent situation, yes, then we probably have to reconsider and decide what else could be done on the pricing front, but we're not ruling out a general price increase. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Good afternoon guys. I wanted to come back to your strategy on alcohol. So now with the CANarchy deal closed, do you think the company has the right product portfolio, distribution and capabilities at this point in time to deliver against your ambitions? You've been talking about this for the better part of two years and now with this deal closed, do you think you have everything that you need to deliver? And I guess, specifically, just to kind of drill down a little bit, do you think that you need more in terms of capabilities with respect to spirits, both consumer capabilities, a broader wholesaler distribution network? And if the answer to that is yes, how do you intend to sort of address that and is larger scale M&A a possibility? Rodney Sacks : I think that the CANarchy acquisition is not the complete answer to everything. They are craft brands. They are -- they have a distribution network. They have some sales of brands. We do have a good infrastructure in staff there, and we have -- we're going to use that to build on. We are going to look at taking the distribution system, refining a little bit. We're looking at addressing their products and taking steps to invigorate their sales and looking at our own products that we've been developing, that we have discussed previously and taking and deciding where to and help to launch those through the CANarchy system. And we will separately address the possible M&A of additional brands, whether in a -- sort of in the malt side, the beer side or the spirit side. Those are things that are opportunities. But again, we're looking at the whole business now and reviewing it, but it's the platform that is really good for us. And I think that is what is -- that's the function that's going to serve for us. We are going to obviously have to address issues and other matters in getting that fully implemented. It's not just a perfect system that we've taken over. But it's a good base for us, and we're going to build on it, and we're very confident and we're very pleased with having closed that acquisition, which will give us the springboard from here on. Operator : The next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Please go ahead. Vivien Azer : Hi, good evening. Thank you for the questions. I was wondering if you could just offer some better detail on your supply chain in Russia, in the Ukraine and if you could quantify your exposure to those two countries, please? Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. Well, those countries, including Belarus, in Kazakhstan, which really work within that region account for about 10% of our sales in our EMEA sales. So we have a nice business in Russia, which -- we have to see what happens there, and we have a reasonable business in Ukraine. We have staff and we have people in those countries. And it's really concerning is to -- we don't know what will happen, and it's really concerning, frankly. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg for closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.52 billion in the 2022 first quarter, 22.1% higher than net sales of $1.24 billion in the 2021 comparable period. As in recent quarters, to meet increased demand for our products, rather than experience out of stocks for certain lines at retail, the company incurred operational inefficiencies in the United States and in various countries, resulting in increased costs.  During the 2022 first quarter, the company continued to procure additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States and abroad in response to increased consumer demand. In the first quarter of 2022, the company experienced significant increases in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 first quarter, primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, as well as aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing. The company also experienced a significant increase in ingredient and other input costs, secondary packaging materials, co-packing fees and production inefficiencies. The company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products.  This necessitated the company air freighting substantial quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continued to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. In the United States, the company secured additional co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of its products. The company estimates that approximately $46 million of costs in the quarter were the result of operating inefficiencies due in part to strong consumer demand, including the importation of aluminum cans, as well as COVID-19-related issues such as port congestion, shortage of shipping containers resulting in the need to airfreight ingredients, which the company continues to address.  In addition, increased commodity and raw materials costs, including aluminum, other ingredient costs and secondary packaging incurred during the quarter, amounted to approximately $45 million, and increases in freight rates and fuel impacted gross profits by approximately $6 million.  Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2022 first quarter was 51.1% compared with 57.5% in the 2021 frist quarter. The decrease in gross profit percentage for the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of the items mentioned previously as well as geographical sales mix. Additionally, [ Drop ] requires a first value step-up of the CANarchy inventories of $3.8 million, which together with expenses related to the acquisition of CANarchy of $4.2 million during the quarter, adversely affected both gross margins and operating expenses.  The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 first quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Operating expenses for the 2022 first quarter was $377.2 million, compared with $300.8 million in the 2021 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 first quarter were 24.8% compared with 24.2% in the 2021 first quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2022 first quarter increased to $81.4 million, which is an increase of 49.7% or 5.4% of net sales compared to $54.4 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2021 first quarter. The $27 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to increased freight out costs of $20.6 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight, as well as higher warehouse expenses of $6.4 million as a result of higher raw material and finished good product inventories in the United States and EMEA. We believe that a portion of the increase in distribution expenses that we experienced in the quarter are likely to be transitory.  The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased expenditures for travel and entertainment, increased payroll expenses, increased professional services expenses, including accounting and legal expenses, increased commissions and increased sponsorships and endorsements. During the comparative 2021 first quarter, the company decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment as well as our marketing programs largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on such expenses during the 2022 first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 first quarter were 24.8% as compared to operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 first quarter pre-COVID, which was 27.7%.  Our 2 new suppliers of aluminum cans in the United States are now operational. And as a result, we are able to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminum cans in the United States. In the United States, we anticipate seeing a reduction in cost of sales related to the use of imported aluminum cans in the latter half of 2022. Although, we expect to reduce the importation of aluminum cans into EMEA in the second half of 2022, we will only see a reduction in cost of sales after we have worked through current inventories of imported cans in EMEA. We rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce excessive cost of long-distance freight to satisfy demand and to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in cost.  Operational income -- sorry, operating income for the 2022 first quarter decreased 3.5% to $399.5 million from $414.1 million in the 2021 comparative quarter, primarily due to the company's operations in EMEA and Asia Pacific.  Net income decreased 6.7% to $294.2 million as compared to $315.2 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 first quarter decreased 6.8% to $0.55 from $0.59 in the first quarter of 2021. Through pricing actions during the quarter, the company was able to record positive pricing actions in excess of 3% in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company is planning for a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022. The company is also monitoring the opportunity for additional pricing actions internationally as well as in United States.  According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 23, 2022, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.5% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 23, 2022, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 3.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign increased 4.8% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 23, 2022, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 0.4 of a point to 37.5%. Monster share increased 0.6 share points to 31.6%. Reign share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.4%. NOS' share decreased 0.2 points to 2.6%. And Full Throttle share remained at 0.7 of a percent. Red Bull's share decreased 1.5 points to 35.3%. Rockstar share was down 0.2 points to 3.6%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to 4.4%. And VPX Bang share decreased 1.2 points to 6.6%.

Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 2.4% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 11.7% lower. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily included Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee, for the 4 weeks ended April 23, 2022, was 55.3%, up 4.2 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 42.9%, down 3.1 points.  According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2022, the energy drink category increased 13.5% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 11.6% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 41.5% down 0.7 points.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 25.4% for the month of March 2022. Monster sales increased 28.9%. Monster's market share in value increased 0.8 of a share point to 28.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 67% and its market share increased 0.9 of a share point to 3.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2022 compared to March 2021, Monster's retail market share in value decreased in Argentina from 45.2% to 45%. Monster's Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.  According to Nielsen, for the month of March -- month of March 2022 compared to March 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 34.9% to 40.2%. Monster is now the leading energy brand in value in Brazil, marking another important milestone for our brand in South America.  In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of March 2022, decreased from 40% to 36.3%, due to a shortage of shipping containers. Our bottler in Chile is in the process of validating its new production line in order to increase our in-country production.  I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.  According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending April 2, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period of the previous year, grew from 14.7% to 16.2% in Germany. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 20.7% to 20.3% in South Africa.  According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 27, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 25.5% to 27.1% in Denmark, from 31.9% to 32.1% in France, from 27.9% to 29.3% in Great Britain, from 27.2% to 27.6% in Norway, from 18.1% to 21.4% in Poland, from 36% to 37.8% in Spain, and from 14.9% to 15.9% in Sweden.

According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the last month ending March 2022, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 54.8% to 59.4%.  We again point out that in certain market statistics that cover single months, or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.  Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $553.4 million, 36.4% of total net sales in the 2022 first quarter compared to $459.4 million or 36.9% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $32.9 million in the 2022 first quarter.  Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.  In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 21.8% in dollars and increased 30% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, for the first quarter was 29.6% compared to 37.3% in the same quarter in 2021. Gross profit in the first quarter was impacted by higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased freight for imported cans, increased raw material and ingredient costs, as well as airfreight costs.  In -- the company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 first quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.  In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 1.9% in dollars and increased 9.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 40.9% versus 48.8% over the same period in 2021. In Japan, net sales in the 2022 first quarter decreased 5.8% in dollars, but increased 3.4% in local currency. Sales decreased over the same period in 2021, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.  In South Korea, net sales increased 71.7% in dollars and 86.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea.  In China, net sales decreased 8.9% in dollars and 10.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.  In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 13.8% in dollars and 7.9% in local currencies. Sales in Australia and New Zealand were negatively impacted by shipping delays of certain flavors, concentrates and ingredients. Furthermore, sales in Australia were also impacted by severe flooding in that country in the 2022 first quarter.  In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 52.5% in dollars and increased 59.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 103.1% in dollars and 146.4% in local currency in the 2022 first quarter. I will now discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which I will refer to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. In June 2020, Monster Energy Company, which I will refer to as MEC and Orange Bang, Inc., a family-owned beverage business and the rightful owner of several trademark registrations to the Bang marks, initiated an arbitration against VPX.  MEC and Orange Bang allege that VPX reached a 2010 settlement agreement with Orange Bang that restricted VPX's use of the Bang trademark to products that are creatine-based or marketed and sold only in nutritional channels as well as claims at VPX infringed Orange Bang's trademark rights to the Bang marks.  In April 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding in favor of MEC and Orange Bang on all claims. The arbitrator found that VPX's Bang Energy Drinks, which VPX advertisers containing super creatine and other Bang branded products do not contain creatine, and do not provide the benefits of creatine. Because Bang branded products are thus not creatine-based, and are not limited to nutritional channels, the arbitrator found they are being sold in breach of the settlement agreement. The arbitrator also found that VPX's Bang branded product infringe Orange Bang's trademarks.  The arbitrated rewarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX's past misconduct and attorney's fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future net sales of Bang products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. Under the arbitrator's order, if VPX fails to pay the royalty, VPX is prohibited from using the Bang mark, subject to certain limited exceptions. MEC and Orange Bang have filed a motion to confirm the arbitrator's award. VPX has filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award. A hearing on VPX's motion is scheduled for June 27, 2022.  MEC's lawsuit against VPX for false advertising, unfair competition, and misappropriation of trade secrets in the Central District of California is still pending, with trials scheduled to begin in August 2022. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on those matters in today's call.  In January of 2022, we introduced our first 16-ounce Ultra Variety 12 packs, which are being well received by consumers, and we are continuing to expand our multi-pack portfolio in the 2022 first quarter. In February of 2022, we introduced new flavor innovations with Ultra Peachy Keen, Juice Monster Aussie Style Lemonade, Rehab Watermelon and Reign Reignbow Sherbet.  In February 2022, we launched our newest brand nationally, True North Pure Energy Seltzer in 4, 12-ounce flavors through the Coca-Cola distribution network.  At the end of the 2022, 1st quarter, we launched 2 new ready-to-drink nitro-infused coffee products, Java Monster Cold Brew Latte and Java Monster Cold Brew Sweet Black. In Canada, in January of 2022, we introduced Monster Ultra Gold. In February of 2022, we grew Canada's Reign portfolio by launching Reign White Gummy Bear.  We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the first quarter of 2022. In Argentina, we launched VR46 The Doctor. In Chile, we expanded our Reign Lemon by launching Melon Mania, Lemonades and Orange Dreamsicle. In Mexico, we launched our second Predator SKU with Predator Mean Green. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in Puerto Rico and Monster Mango Loco in Colombia.  In the 2022 first quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Gold and Mother Kiwi Sublime in Australia and New Zealand. We launched our third Super Fuel flavor in Tropical Thunder.  In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries. We also launched Ultra Fiesta, Watermelon and Gold and Juiced Monarch, Khaotic and Pacific Punch in a number of countries during the 2022 first quarter.  During the 2022 first quarter, we also launched Predator and Reign in additional countries. During the first quarter of 2020, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Singapore. We also introduced the Predator brand in India. In April 2022, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Japan. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the course of 2022.  Our co-packing network is an integral part of the company's production model, which we intend to preserve. The owner of one of the co-packing facilities with which we contracted located in Norwalk, California, announced earlier this year that they would be selling this facility and ceasing its operations at this facility. To maintain adequate supply of the company's products, we have acquired the associated real property, leases and equipment of this co-packing facility for a purchase price of $62.5 million. Following the purchase, the facility will be closed for a period of time, before the company is able to commence production. We estimate April 2022 sales including CANarchy to be approximately 6.7% higher than in April 2021 and 4.8% higher than in April 2021, excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding CANarchy, April 2022 sales would have been approximately 7.7% higher than the comparable April 2021 sales. April 2022 had 1 less selling day compared to April 2021.  We mentioned that April 2022 sales had a challenging hurdle to meet over April 2021 sales. You may recall that in our 2021 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we estimated that April 2021 sales were approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative 2020 sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we estimated that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales. April 2021, April 2020 and April 2019, all had the same number of selling days.  The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing filling capacity across all regions to address demand for April. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.  In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to address challenges in its supply chain by sourcing cans and primary ingredients and blends, increasing its manufacturing capacity and increasing finished product inventories. This should enable us to improve our service levels and lower transportation costs across North America, EMEA and LatAm. Our AFF's flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region.  We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign, Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that CANarchy presents. While we believe that we will be able to address many of the supply chain challenges we have faced, we anticipate still having to face certain ongoing challenges in the future. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Your U.S. sales continue to come in very strong again this quarter, and show a sustained decoupling versus the scanner data, implying obviously very strong growth in the untracked channels. Can you just review for us what level of growth you're seeing in those untracked channels? What are the key drivers behind it? And then as we think about the U.S. going forward, can you discuss your thoughts on potential Monster top line weakness or category weakness, if we do see a consumer spending slowdown? And if you think we've seen any demand impact so far from higher gas prices? Hilton Schlosberg : So Dara, turning to your first question, there's always a disconnect between our sales, which are sales in the main to distributors and as well, we sell, obviously, to some direct accounts, including the untracked channels. It's really difficult for us to get that information to this investor group. There will always -- all I can say is there will always be a disconnect. And Nielsen is not a true indication even for sales through the distributor system, because the lags in the distribution system as well.  And then turning to your second question about gas prices. We've seen this before. We've seen gas prices moving up, and we've seen sales of energy drinks really staying the course. And at the end of the day, remember that we have a business that is based on a brand, that is a lifestyle brand, and consumers purchase the Monster product because it's part of what they believe to be, and it's what they want to be. It's not something that's necessarily that price-sensitive and that made us kind of feel confident about our decision to take up pricing later this year. We've really took pricing up, as we mentioned, through pricing actions, and we will be taking pricing up effective September 1. Rodney Sacks : The only thing I would maybe add just from 1 aspect. Traditionally, the convenience channel was growing more quickly for the energy category than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And in recent quarters, that had been reversed with less -- lower driving through COVID and then you've got higher gas prices.  So I mean, at the moment, if you look at the latest 4 weeks or 1-week numbers, the convenience channel is growing less than if you look at the all major channels. But I think that's something that we've managed to achieve the results. We have -- despite that and despite the fact that, in fact, convenience is our largest channel, which I just think is positive for the future, because we think that will ride itself eventually when gas prices sort of normalize and/or people just get used to the gas prices and becomes whatever the level is, people will get used to it eventually and continue to drive. Hilton Schlosberg : If you look, for example, at the last 2 weeks, Nielsen in convenience, April the 16, we're seeing Nielsen sales in convenience for the energy category growing at 4.8%. And we're seeing the following week, which is April 23, which is what we discussed on this call, convenience in that 1-week growing 7%.  So the market will continue to grow. As I said earlier, Monster is an affordable luxury, and we don't anticipate at this time seeing a dramatic falloff in sales in the convenience and gas channel. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Rodney, on the 6% price increase starting in September in the U.S., I'm assuming that's on top of the 3% average that you had in Q1. And is that across -- it's great, and is that across all products and channels or balanced with RGM? And what are you hearing from retailers in terms of competitors following or not? Hilton Schlosberg : So that price increase is in addition to the pricing actions that we took in the first quarter that we started taking in the last quarter of 2021, and will continue through this year. So we have taken pricing actions. We'll continue to take pricing actions. September 1, there will be a market-wide increase. And we said approximately 6% depending on channel. And so far, we have not heard any rumblings from competitors about what they're doing and what they're not doing. We haven't heard anything from retailers.  But as I said on a previous call, we're running our own brand, irrespective of the competitors. We believe in the power of our brand, and we have strong brands, and we believe that this pricing action is justified. And it's certainly justified in terms of all the costs, that we are seeing the cost increases and no doubt, our competitors are seeing the same cost increases. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : So you guys called out certainly many pressures this quarter impacting your business to really fill the strong underlying demand. Yet, I just wanted to circle back, because I thought you guys had made some progress in some of the distribution inefficiencies such as maybe already purchasing more supply in the U.S. during the quarter as well as started to operate back within your orbit. So maybe touch on that for us, please? And then, Rodney, can you help us understand maybe where things stand now as it relates to some of these pressures. Have they already started to ease? You mentioned a few things, but just trying to confirm that you've already seen improvement or is it really going to take until the second half until we see improvements on your gross margins? And then finally, I'd be curious to hear how much stronger your sales might have been in the quarter if you could have supplied enough product to fill a strong consumer demand? If you could quantify that for us, that would be helpful. Hilton Schlosberg : Let me just deal with the first part of your question, Bonnie, and then we can obviously get Rodney's input on the rest.  As we look at the quarter, remember, the Ukraine conflict started on February the 24. So we had a dramatic increase in fuel prices, which we really didn't forecast. And we also had a dramatic increase in aluminum prices. And if you just look at aluminum prices, aluminum, the commodity went up 65% in Q1 '22 versus the previous year Q1 2021. So there were unexpected issues that surfaced in the quarter.  I think we said at the time that we were building up inventories and that's what we've been doing. We've absolutely been building up inventories in the quarter, and you'll see that reflected in our balance sheet. We're probably in a good position now, better than we have been in terms of supply. And as we also said on this call is that April, we did not have a shortage of containers or product to any significant degree. So we're as well placed as we have been in the past to satisfy demand. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Two, if I could. Just to come back to the 6% pricing, which is certainly a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough to cover the inflationary pressures that you've seen over the past couple of years. Maybe just comment on the magnitude of it, how you arrived at that, why you believe that's the appropriate number? And then with respect to the April sales update and not to overweight any one given month, and your point in the comparison is entirely fair. But anything that you're seeing within the business that gives you any concern about underlying demand. It certainly doesn't sound that way, but I just wanted to ask given the step-down from what we saw from very strong results in the quarter. Hilton Schlosberg : Remember the hurdle we had in '21, that was probably one of the biggest hurdles we've seen. And -- so I think that April, as we've always said, 1-month in isolation should not be construed as indicative of performance for a quarter or a longer period of time. The way we got to our price increase is -- price increase, remember, we're already taking pricing actions. And we look at a whole bunch of factors, and there's a whole lot of factors that we take into account in determining where we should be. And obviously, price points are a big driver. And what we believe is fair and that the consumer will bear, that becomes a very big factor in assessing the price points and then, of course, assessing the extent of the price increase. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I guess just a short question. So anything preventing the company from buying stock back once the quiet period post the Q filing is complete? Hilton Schlosberg : No. It's a short answer. Rodney Sacks : You've answered it. We will be recommencing some buying activities. Hilton Schlosberg : It's a short question and short answer. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks very much. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 second quarter, 13.2% higher than net sales of $1.46 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 16.9% higher on foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy drinks, the company prioritized ensuring product availability for its customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions despite adversely impacting the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profitability. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brands. During the 2022 second quarter, the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 second quarter, primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, geographical and product sales mix and production inefficiencies. The company estimates that of the increase in cost of sales in the 2022 second quarter of $250.3 million, approximately $164.4 million was comprised of; one, approximately $66.7 million due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans; two, approximately $45.9 million due to increased ingredient and other import costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; three, approximately $27.5 million due to increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing; four, approximately $15.1 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and five, approximately $9.2 million due to production inefficiencies. The company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products. As a result, the company continued to air freight substantial quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continued to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 second quarter was 47.1%, compared to 57.2% in the 2021 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 second quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Operating expenses for the 2022 second quarter were $406. 9 million, compared with $310.9 million in the 2021 second quarter. The comparative operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter included a $16.9 million reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 second quarter were 24.6%, compared with 21.3% in the 2021 second quarter and 25.6% in the 2019 second quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 second quarter increased to $87.9 million, which is an increase of 36% or 5.3% of net sales, compared to $64.6 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2021 second quarter and 3.4% of net sales in the 2019 second quarter pre-COVID. The $23.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to increased freight out expenses of $13.5 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight, as well as higher warehouse expenses of $9.7 million as a result of higher raw material and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements, and increased expenditures for travel and entertainment. Certain of these increases were the result of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return to activities consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in both the U.S. and EMEA. We anticipate seeing a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long distance freight to satisfy demand and to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. Operating income for the 2022 second quarter decreased 29.1% to $373.0 million from $526 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 32.3% to $273.4 million, as compared to $403.8 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 second quarter decreased 32.2% to $0.51 from $0.75 in the second quarter of 2021. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company is implementing a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022. The company will also be implementing price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets, some in addition to price increases or pricing actions taken earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2022, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 8.2% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 23, 2022, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 6.6% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy brands, which include Reign, increased 5.6% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel, sales of Monster increased by 6.4% over the same period versus the previous year, Reign sales increased 0.9%, NOS was down 1.8% and Full Throttle was down 2.5%.

Monster share decreased from 30.6% a year ago to 30.5%, Reign share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.3%, NOS share decreased 0.2 point to 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Red Bull share decreased one percentage point from 37.4% a year ago to 36.4%, Rockstar share was down 0.3 point to 3.5%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 at 4.2% and VPX Bang share decreased 1.6 points to 6%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 23, 2022, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 4.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 2.3% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 9.4% higher. Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended July 23, 2022 was 50.9%, down 1 point, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.7%, up 2.2 points. According to Nielsen in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 18, 2022, the energy drink category increased 12.8% in dollars. Sales of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy drink brands increased 8.5% versus a year ago. The market share of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy drink brands was 40%, down 1.6 points. Monster sales increased 10.8% and its market share decreased 0.7 point to 34.8%. NOS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 0.4 to 1.5%. Full Throttle sales increased 13% and its market share remained at 0.6%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 21.2% for the month of June 2022. Monster sales increased 26.9%. Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market share in value increased 1.3 points to 28.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 53.1% and its market share increased 0.8 of a share point to 4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2022, compared to June 2021, Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 46.9% to 49.2%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading brand in value in Argentina. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2022 compared to June 2021, Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 35.7% to 39.9%. Monster is now the leading energy brand in value in Brazil, marking another important milestone for our brand in South America. In Chile, Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retail share for the month of June 2022 decreased from 41.9% to 38.1% due to a shortage of shipping containers. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending July 17, 2022, Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 25.8% to 31.6% in France from 27.8% to 32.1% in Norway and from 37.6% to 39.7% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $649 million, 39.2% of total net sales in the 2022 second quarter, compared to $546.3 million or 37.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $53.4 million in the 2022 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased 13.8% in dollars and increased 26.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 26.7%, compared to 39.8% in the same quarter in 2021. Gross profit in the second quarter was impacted by increased freight for imported cans, increased raw material and ingredient costs and increased co-packing fees, higher aluminum commodity pricing and air freight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 27.1%. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We are also pleased that in the 2022 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the 2022 second quarter decreased 1.1% in dollars and increased 8.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

In Japan, net sales in the 2022 second quarter decreased 9.6% in dollars and increased 3.3% in local currency. Sales performance for the comparable period in 2021 was largely impacted due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan. In South Korea, net sales decreased 5.2% in dollars and increased 3.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales decreased 2.1% in dollars and 8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam, net sales increased 1.3% in dollars and 7.6% in local currencies. Sales in Australia and New Zealand were negatively impacted by shipping delays of certain flavors, concentrates and ingredients. Furthermore, sales in Australia were also impacted by severe flooding in that country in the 2022 second quarter. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased 66.7% in dollars and increased 69.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 200.1% in dollars and 26 9.4% in local currency in the 2022 second quarter. I will now provide the most recent update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which I will refer to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. In June 2020, Monster Energy Company, which I will refer to as MEC and Orange Bang, Inc., a family-owned beverage business and the rightful owner of several trademark registrations to the Bang marks initiated an arbitration against VPX. MEC and Orange Bang alleged that VPX breached a 2010 settlement agreement with Orange Bang that restricted VPX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of the Bang trademark to products that are creatine-based or marketed and sold only in nutritional channels, as well as claims that VPX infringed Orange Bang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trademark rights to the Bang marks. In April 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding in favor of MEC and Orange Bang on all claims. The arbitrator awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past misconduct, as well as attorneys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy drinks and other Bang branded products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. On July 1, 2022, the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted MEC and Orange Bang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motion to confirm the arbitrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s award and denied VPX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motion to vacate the arbitrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s award. MEC and Orange Bang have requested that the court end to final judgment. On July 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the non-circuit. The company will not recognize the award or royalties until such time as they are realized or realizable. Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a ruling affirming the decision of the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida, in which the District Court rejected VPX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that MEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line of Reign energy drinks infringed the trade rest of its line of Bang energy drinks. MEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawsuit against VPX for force advertising, unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets in the Central District of California is still pending with trial scheduled to begin later this month. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subdued, I will not be answering any questions on those matters on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. The first alcohol-based product line that we plan to launch since the acquisition of CANarchy will be a full bodied flavored malt beverage that will be launched late in the 2022 fourth quarter under the brand name the Beast Unleashed. Beast Unleashed will leverage Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand equity, while carving out its own unique space in the beverage alcohol sector and will be distinguishable from the many hard seltzer brands that have become so ubiquitous over the last several years. The Beast Unleashed will have a 6% alcohol content by volume and will come in four great tasting bold flavors, which are based on certain of Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-known and popular flavor profiles. Beast Unleashed will be launched through beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased state launch approach, with the goal of being national by the end of 2023 and will initially be offered in 16-ounce single-serve cans, as well as a 12-can variety pack in 12-ounce sleek cans. Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust, with a number of additional innovative product lines currently under development. We look forward to sharing use of such additional alcohol beverage products at a later date. We are excited about the planned launch of our new Monster Energy Zero Sugar energy drink in the 2022 fourth quarter initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable Zero Sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunity that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. In April of 2022, we launched Pure North Energy Seltzers in sleek 355 ml cans in three flavors Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry and Grape fruit Lemonade in Canada. At the end of June 2022, we expanded our core Monster Energy portfolio in Canada by launching Monster Reserve in two flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple, both in 473 ml cans. In Latin America, we introduced several new energy drinks in our Monster Energy Predator and Fury product lines in certain Latin American countries in the 2022 second quarter. In April 2022 in New Zealand, we launched LIVE+ Watermelon, our fourth LIVE+ flavor. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched Juiced Monarch and Chaotic during the 2022 second quarter. During the 2022 second quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Relentless, Nalu and Reign in certain countries. During the second quarter of 2022, we launched Predator in Turkey and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India and Vietnam in June, expanding the brand to East India and North Vietnam. We also launched Predator in Cambodia in July 2022. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the second half of 2022. In Japan, we launched Monster Super Fuel Killer Kiwi and Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise in China. We estimate July 2022 sales, including to be CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in July 2021 and 11.2% higher than in July 2021 excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding CANarchy, July 2022 sales would have been approximately 16.6% higher than the comparable July 2021 sales. July 2022 has had one less selling day compared to July 2021. The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing facility -- capacity across all regions to address demand for July. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue, in certain regions our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company is increasing its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products. Two, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. Three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. Four, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Five, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. Six, we are enthusiastic for the planned launch of the Beast Unleased, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product and for the opportunity that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we believe that we will be able to address many of the challenges we have experienced in our supply chain. Eight, we consider that certain of the increased costs we have experienced in the quarter may well be transitory. For example, the current cost of aluminum has reduced materially from its recent March highs and we are beginning to see a reduction in fuel and freight costs, as well as reductions in the cost of shipping containers and ocean freight. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator :  Our first question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. Thanks. Hi. Operator : Your line is now open. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Thank you. I guess a question on gross margins. I simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand really why they were the bad in the quarter. I guess I was under the impression that you were already buying a fair amount of your aluminum cans from U.S., and therefore, should have been less reliant on the importation of cans, I guess, at least in the U.S. So, I thought that was the plan. However, I do see your inventory levels in the quarter went even higher and are almost three times the level they were last year. So, I guess, help us understand that and just trying to think through, is this really the right way to manage the business? And then, Hilton, you mentioned these pressures are transitory or it was in the release, but I guess, they are not really feeling like it. So when do you guys expect to be 100% buying in the U.S. and EMEA for your supply, and really no longer importing aluminum cans? Hilton Schlosberg : Sure. Bonnie, thank you for that question. I think a lot of people probably may want to ask the same question. So thanks for addressing it early on. We have always taken a stance that objective is to support our customers and our consumers. We went through entire times in 2020 and 2021 when we did not have enough capacity to service our customers and our consumers. We had bottler screaming. We had retailer screaming, and at the time, we made a very conscious effort that we were going to import cans at expensive costs, not in terms of the actual cost of the can, but the cost of importing a cans, the container costs, the marriage, the which you guys call the merge, just everything relating to the importation of aluminum cans. So that was an absolute conscious decision. As cans started arriving late in 2021, EMEA was the most affected. I think we have had a number of discussions about how EMEA was affected and a substantial number of those cans went into EMEA and have been consumed over a period of time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult with our business because we have promotions from time-to-time. For example, we have got the Apex Legends promotions now and the cans that come in are not promotional cans. So, they are using production when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market and market demand. So, in EMEA, we stopped importing cans. We thought we would still have to import cans during 2022. We stopped that and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer importation of cans into EMEA in 2022. In 2021, we have had  coming in the U.S. and we will soon be out of those cans as soon as we get over this Apex Legends promotion. But in the U.S., the percentage of imported cans in our furnish is very low compared to what it was in the second quarter in EMEA. So, I hope that answers your question. We did it as a conscious effort to support and to supply our customers because we are in this business for the long-term. We are not in this business for the second quarter of 2022. We are in this business for the long-term and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to us to ensure that our customers and our consumers continue to have energy products. Operator : Your next question. Hilton Schlosberg : So is there anything else that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer that or I should have answered, Bonnie? Bonnie Herzog : But, I guess, for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still back the question as you are making this conscious decision to keep have a bigger supply of cans and have elevated inventory. How do we think about that as I assume you are going to work down that inventory now? Is that starting to happen or will happen in Q3 and Q4, and I assume it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very elevated cost. So do we think about these pressures on your gross margin, quite frankly, very much continuing Q3 and Q4, is that right about the product? Hilton Schlosberg : No. As I -- yeah. Okay. Great question. As we look at the future, I mean, that in cost of sales, fuel is coming down, we know that. We know that freight is coming down. We are in that every day of our lives. We know that ocean freight is coming down. We know that we have been able now to really diminish the amount of materials that we having to airfreight to keep the wheels moving with product that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming out of the U.S. with concentrates. We know that AFF is producing and up and running in Ireland. We know that the percentage of aluminum cans is coming down. We know that aluminum costs are coming down. Aluminum reached a peak -- see if I can find it just very quickly. The maximum level of aluminum, including the Midwest premium was 1.8073 in March -- on March 7th. We buy where we are not hedged -- the portion that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hedged is bought at M minus 1. So, the March cans, so the April cans would be based on March pricing. So and we know that aluminum today including, let me find that, including the Midwest premium is 1.36. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come down from a peak of 1.81 to 1.36. So we know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact, right? We also know that we built up inventories, which we had to because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventories we were talking about in 2021 were just not sustainable. They were just not sustainable. So we built up inventories and we are now able to avoid a lot of the shipping, the freight that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been out of orbit. So you add all of that together and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give forecast. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to start giving forecast. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very clear that 2022, the second quarter, as in fact, we had anticipated would probably be our worst quarter in terms of margin. But I just want to stress again that we are in business for the long-term and we are supporting our customers and our business in the long-term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. On the same topic and I tried to do the phasing of the cost pressures and the pricing, would you say pricing both domestic, international would be by that mid single-digit and could probably cover about a third of this $250 million that you quoted? And then you have, of course, and I appreciate the breakdown that you gave, you can phase out some of this higher cost for aluminum, also the $67 million that you said to bring cans imported. So would you end up to about from the $250 million to about $100 million to $150 million in pressures into the fourth quarter, I want to check that? And then on the Monster Zero Sugar, congrats on that, should we think like we obviously have seen Coke Zero Sugar recruit new customer -- new consumers into the category, are you thinking how incremental that could be against Ultra? I am assuming, as Rodney said, it attracts the need state for the typical Monster consumer, because of the taste profile, and also because of the packaging and some more masculine and more into the core consumer, is that fair? Do you have the shelves coming in, how much support you believe you can give to the launch? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So those were two questions all in. I will start with the first one. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give guidance and what I have tried to do on this call is give some direction. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we are saying -- that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we are seeing is coming down. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to happen overnight, because there are costs in the system that will take their time to work through. So, in principle as, since we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give guidance, I have given some general direction, which I hope you will find helpful and the other analysts will find helpful in analyzing where we go from here. But I just want to repeat yet again that we are in this business for the long-term. We are in this business to support our customers. And yes, maybe we did take a hiccup in gross margin in 2022 -- the second quarter of 2022, but there have been a lot of other cost pressures, including imported cans, imported cans being one of them, but at least we were able to bring our inventories back to a situation where we are able to service customers and we are able to service consumers. Look, it will be a terrible situation, when our price goes up in September 1 and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have sufficient inventories to satisfy demand. I mean, that would just be the end. So we have done our very best to stay on track and to work within a very, very difficult supply chain environment. Rodney Sacks : Perhaps. Thanks. Hilton, I could address the second part on the actual Zero Sugar. I think that we have hedge Zero sugar products. We have the full Ultra line. We have low carb and absolutely zero. But none of them have been really an analog of our original Monster Green. The original Monster Green flavor, which we have had now for over 20 years is still our leading product pretty much in every the world. Consumers do want a choice, and as consumers, I think, get a little older, they do start looking to -- for a sugar -- zero sugar or sugar-free alternative, but we would obviously like to stay in the same franchise with the same product, with the same personality. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a black can with a sort of green claw. And so we feel there is a way to, A, increase the franchise to bring additional consumers who really want that original Monster flavor, but in a Zero Sugar and also to retain and broaden our existing consumer base, as we bring younger consumers in, they tend to not be as worried or concerned about the sugar content. As you get a little older, I think, sugar content does become an issue. There are also in many countries around the world, they have started to tax products with sugar, have label requirements. So we think that by having an offering our original green Monster in a sugar-free -- a zero-sugar version with a very similar can, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distinguishable, but very similar with, as I said, it still has the same personality and image. We believe we will further entrench our consumer base and expand it for many years to come. So, we think this is a very important development and an important way we can continue to solidify and make Monster and keep it unique because the Monster flavor is its own unique flavor that is so popular and we would like to continue to expand on it and build on it. So, the plans are to obviously roll this out after the U.S. very extensively. Operator :  Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I am going to ask one question in two parts, but I swear it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s related. So, the first one, Hilton, I mean, obviously, I get everybody gets what you are saying about guidance, what you think about cost pressures. I just think it would be immensely helpful based on just the commentary that I have been getting from folks or feedback from your shareholders. If you could at least just directionally confirm the gross margins should get better from here and if you could give a sort of magnitude around it, I think it would be helpful. But the related and more serious question is, you have a lot of volatility historically in gross margin, and I have asked this question before, but I am curious, given the current environment, how you think about whether you want to do more with the Coke system from a procurement standpoint, potentially manufacturing through their co-packers in the U.S. or their bottlers in the U.S.? And has there been any sort of change in how you might be thinking about that, given, obviously, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened over the last, call it, 12 months where you would have less to worry about, I suppose, if you are working with them more closely? Hilton Schlosberg : Yeah. So, with regard to your first point, I think I have already answered that. I believe that the second quarter is probably -- we are probably going to see the lowest margin in the year. And as regards better direction than that, Mark, we just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it. We just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give guidance. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first point. And then on the second point is, we are really not sure and we have had discussions with our distribution partner on a number of issues. And we are not sure that further engagement with them on any of these topics would be positive, but -- positive in terms of lowering cost of sales. But we are continuing to have those discussions and if it makes sense, then definitely we will -- we definitely will. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to disclose too much, but one of our partners in Europe, that is actually part of the Coca-Cola system, did not fare better in procuring cans than we were able to. So I just want to just put all of this in perspective that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a panacea. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hope you are doing well. I guess I will ask about topline I guess. So, Rodney, Hilton, I guess, I just wanted to ask about Bang, like what are you seeing there in terms of shelf space and kind of what do you expect as they kind of transition to distributors? And I guess, do you see a potential opportunity for you to capture some of that incremental shelf space? Hilton Schlosberg : I think generally in transitions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Rodney Sacks : Yeah. Hilton Schlosberg : \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always upheavals, okay. IT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S transitions never happen cleanly overnight. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always upheavals. And remember, that Bang is in a lot of the Pepsi shelf space and a lot of the Pepsi Cos and despite that you guys have seen their shares decrease over the last 24 months or so. So I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say any more than that. I am not sure if Rodney wants to say anymore, but I would say that, obviously, we continue to grow up as much shelf space as we can. We contract for a lot of our own shelf space and we work with the Coke bottlers and then, on the other hand, we work in with the Pepsi space and with the Pepsi coolers. Rodney Sacks : Yeah. Just to bullet lightly. I mean, the -- if Bang transitions out of the Pepsi coolers, you have obviously all aware of the announcement that Celsius who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been trying to secure and has been securing additional shelf space, we will go into the Pepsi system. So there will be a lot of fighting going on. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Ghost brand lining you to a lesser degree and C4. So you have got all of these sort of performance brands basically fighting for some more shelf space, and obviously, we will do the same. So there will be a lot of transition going on and we believe that we are obviously focused on that as well and our own brands and increasing our own shelf space. Operator : Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi guys. One of the things we have been watching care\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hilton Schlosberg : Hi, Kaumil. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey. Hi, Hilton. We have been watching carefully about the impact on inflation on the consumer with gas prices and stuff. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like we have seen a slowdown at all. I am curious which you are observing and maybe if you have done any test in markets like maybe Midland, Texas or Phoenix, or some of those markets where inflation is much higher than it has been nationally if you are perhaps seeing different trends? Hilton Schlosberg : So what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to comment on is, one, retailer and I am not going to mention who they are in terms of their own schematics and their own structures, went early on the price increase. They rolled out early and not only with us but with the competition as well and they have seen no reduction in sales based on that action. So what we are seeing anecdotally is a continuation of the growth in the category. Yes, it has slowed somewhat, but look in Europe, where the categories are a lot older. The growth has been escalating there faster than in the U.S. So we have seen that and now we are seeing the other concern may be abating everyone is asking questions about gas prices and well gas prices affect the consumption of energy drinks, and frankly, we said at the time that when we have seen high gas prices a portion that hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affected the sale of energy drinks and we are seeing gas prices now coming down slowly, but truly they are coming down. So I think that maybe answers your question as well. Operator : And our final question for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q&A will come from Charlie Higgs with Redburn. Charlie Higgs : Hi, Hilton, Rodney. Thanks for the question. Hilton Schlosberg : Hi, Charlie. Totally fine. Charlie Higgs : Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the price increases you put through in your international markets and what the response is there. And maybe if you could just touch on the scope of the price increases you are planning for in H2 2022, maybe just some information on what countries and what products would be very useful please? Hilton Schlosberg : Yeah. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a range of countries that we took prices in the first half of 2022, either directly in price increases or through a reduction in promotions. And we see an uplift effecting the quarter already of the impact of those price increases. As regards the second six months, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really a list of countries and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we have got the time to go through them now, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a list of countries where we will be taking further price increases where we can. For example, in France, you cannot, if you have gone -- if you have had one price increase in a year, you cannot go with the second price increase. So, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a range of different countries where we will be taking price increases. Brazil, we took price increases earlier this year. Chile, we took a price increase earlier this year. So we have been doing this on a consistent basis, not to profiteer from inflation, but really to mitigate the whole cost in the system has -- you guys will appreciate. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : This concludes Monster Beverage second quarter 2022 conference call. Thank you for attending today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Gentlemen, please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement. Tom Kelly : Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, including the sections contained therein entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 third quarter, 15.2% higher than net sales of $1.41 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 20.2% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for the company's energy drinks, the company prioritized ensuring product availability for its customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions, despite adversely impacting the company's profitability. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. During the 2022 third quarter, the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 third quarter, primarily due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, increased logistical costs, increased aluminum can costs and geographical and product sales mix. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our higher cost imported cans will continue over the next few quarters. However, our main promotion in the third quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally.  We estimate that of the increasing cost of sales in the 2022 third quarter, approximately $84.2 million was comprised of approximately $40. 1 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees to approximately $24.4 million due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans; 3, approximately $11.5 million due to increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing; and 4, approximately $8. 2 million due to geographical and product sales mix. We continue to air freight quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies to enable timely innovation launches. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily as a result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third quarter was 51. 3% compared with 55.9% in the 2021 third quarter, and 47.1% for the 2022 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third was partially offset by pricing actions, including the implementation of our general price increase in the United States effective September 1, 2022, price increases in certain international markets and reductions in promotions. Such pricing actions positively impacted gross profit margins in the 2022 third quarter. Operating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were $415.8 million compared with $344.7 million in the 2021 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were 25.6% compared to 24.4% in the 2021 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID.  Distribution expenses for the 2022 third quarter increased to $83 million, which is an increase of 27.1% or 5.1% of net sales compared to $65.3 million or 4. 6% of net sales in the 2021 third quarter and 3. 3% of net sales in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. The $17.7 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.7 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA as well as increased freight out expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for travel and entertainment. Certain of these increases were the result of the company's return to activities consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We have rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and the EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long distance freight, satisfy demand and to return to our strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in the freight in costs. Operating income for the 2022 third quarter decreased 6% to $417.9 million from $444.5 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 4.4% to $322.4 million as compared to $337.2 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 third quarter decreased 3.9% and to $0.60 from $0.63 in the third quarter of 2021. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States, effective September 1, 2022. In addition to price increases or pricing actions taken earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures, the company implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases early in 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Monster's market share in value increased 2. 2 points to 28.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 94% and and its market share increased 1.5 share points to 4.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2022 compared to September 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 47.9% to 51.7%, and in Brazil from 37.7% to 41. 8%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Brazil. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of September 2022 decreased from 42.2% to 41. 7%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 9, 2020, Monster's reach or market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13. 5% to 15.5% in Belgium; from 26.6% and to 31% in France; from 28.9% to 29.9% in Great Britain; from 20. 7% to 31.6% in Norway; and from 36.9% to 40.3% in Spain.

According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending September 2022, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year increased from 60.4% to 61.5%. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $610.6 million, 37. 6% of total net sales in the 2022 third quarter compared to $527.4 million or 37. 4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $71.3 million in the 2021 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 third quarter increased 14.1% in dollars and increased 30.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 34.7% compared to 37.7% in the same quarter in 2021, and compared to 26.7% in the second quarter of 2022. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 third quarter decreased 13.9% in dollars and decreased 1.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37. 4% versus 43.5% over the same period in 2021, due in part to a product supply issue with an ingredient that impacted a number of our products in Japan, but which has now been resolved, net sales in the 2022 third quarter decreased 35.8% in dollars and decreased 21.2% in local currency. Sales in the 2022 third quarter remain impacted by COVID in certain channels. In South Korea, net sales decreased 8% in dollars but increased 4.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and in South Korea. In China, net sales decreased 6% in dollars and 1.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 30.7% in dollars and 41.5% in local currencies.

We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. We previously discussed the April 2022 final arbitration award, which the arbitrator found in favor of Monster Energy Company, or MEC, and Orange Bang Inc., and against VPX on all claims. The arbitrator awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX' past misconduct as well as attorney's fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bang's energy drinks and other Bang-branded products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. On September 29, 2022, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered final judgment confirming the award. On October 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal of the District Court's final judgment confirming the award. The company will not recognize the award or royalties until such time as they are realized or realizable.  Additionally, on 29 September 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. MEC will not recognize the jury award until such time as the award is realized or realizable. On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. VPX initiated the bankruptcy action before the District Court could decide certain remaining issues. At this -- as this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on those matters on today's call. Our first alcohol-based product line to leverage Monster's brand equity is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2023. The Beast Unleashed will be a full bodied flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume and will come in 4 bold flavors, mean green, white haze, peach perfect and scary berries, all of which are based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles. CANarchy Kanok will introduce The Beast Unleashed through certain beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased approach launch, with the goal of being national by the end of 2023. Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust. In addition to The Beast Unleashed, we will relaunch Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's beer family will get a refresh, including the introduction of Dale's American Light Lager, an easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbs per 12-ounce serving. We also have several additional innovative alcohol beverage products under development and look forward to sharing use of those products at a later date. In the U.S., in September, we began shipping Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle to distributors for an October launch at retail. We are excited about the planned launch of our new Monster Energy Zero Sugar energy drink initially in the United States at retail in January of 2023. Monster Energy's Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. We are planning to launch Monster Tour Water in the United States, in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans in the first half of 2023. Monster Tour Water is a pure unflavored water product. In the first half of 2023, we are also planning to launch Rainstorm in 4 flavors in 12-ounce slim cans to compete directly with certain competitive new entrants in the energy drink category in the United States. In Puerto Rico, during July, we introduced our first 16-ounce 12-pack ultra variety packs. And in August, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and Reserve White Pineapple. In Mexico, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juice Monarch in August. We launched Monster Dragon Tea Lemon in August in Honduras and El Salvador, and in September in Guatemala. In Australia, during the month of July, we expanded our Mother portfolio and launched Mother Lava Guava. In EMEA, in the third quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Assault and Monster Reserve White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched Juiced Monarch, Juiced Chaotic, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 third quarter. During the 2022 third quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Rain in certain countries. We are excited about the planned launch at retail of our new Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink initially in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022, followed by an additional 20 markets in the first quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2022, we launched Predator in Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Jordan, and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022 and the first half of 2023. We also launched Monster Super Cola in a can in Japan in August and Monster Rehab Tea Plus Lemonade in October. We estimate October 2022 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 6. 5% higher than in October 2021 and 5% higher than in October 2021, excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, October 2022 sales would have been approximately 12. 9% higher than the comparable October 2021 sales, and 11.4% higher than October 2021, excluding CANarchy. October 2022 had the same number of selling days as October 2021. The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing filling capacity across all regions to address demand for October. We would like to remind listeners that we took a general price increase in the United States effective September 1, 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases, promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production.  In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. Turning briefly to share repurchases. During the 2022 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock, and as of November 3, 2022, approximately $182.8 million remained available for repurchase under the June 2022 repurchase program. The Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, consumer demand remains solid, even with the pricing actions that have been taken in 2022; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products; three, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region; four, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio; five, we are particularly excited for the launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in January 2023 in the United States. As I mentioned previously, Monster Zero Sugar is an analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. Six, we are planning to launch rate auto body fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international markets and countries. We are also pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. We are enthusiastic for the planned launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product and for the opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are also enthusiastic for the planned launches of the Monster Tour Water and Rainstorm lines in the first half of 2023 in the United States.  Ten, we believe that we will be able to address many of the challenges we have experienced in our supply chain. Eleven, we consider that certain of the increased costs that we have experienced in the quarter may well be transitory. For example, the LME price for aluminum has reduced materially from its recent March highs, and we are beginning to see a reduction in freight costs as well as reductions in the cost of shipping containers and ocean freight. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I was hoping if you can comment on the October performance, excluding FX in the low double digits, and not to take demerit of it, but just understanding if there is some signs of retailers that may have decided to take inventory down or seeing some less or the timing of pricing? And was this performance pretty much consistent across all channels? Hilton Schlosberg : So Alexander (sic) [Andrea] as we look at where we are on the weekly volume trends, we're really not concerned because the trends that we look at are the Nielsen trends and the depletions. So far, volumes seem to be holding up, and we're satisfied with the performance of the price increase. And as you also know, we reduced our promotions as we went through 2022. So at this time, we are continuing to evaluate performance. It looks as if the price increase is, in fact, sticking. I'm looking at numbers. I'm looking at it on my screen now, the total industry and the various participants in the industry, volumes seem to be holding up. So I think that's the only comment that I'd like to make at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : And Hilton, maybe to follow up on that. Can you just talk about what you're seeing internationally in terms of energy category growth. There have obviously been some broader concerns across CPG around macro impacts and weaker consumer spending. And if you could see that impact the consumer broadly and particularly in the energy category? So an update on what you've seen in terms of the category internationally would be helpful. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. So Dara, I think as we look at the category internationally, EMEA really still looks pretty strong. Remember, at the end of the day, we're sending an affordable luxury. So EMEA, and there are lots of concerns in costs in EMEA, gas prices and not necessarily petrol prices, but energy costs are ramping up significantly in EMEA. We've seen lots of other costs hitting us. But at the end of the day, the consumer still seems to be spending, not at the rates they were spending in 2021, but they still seem to be spending on our products anyway. So we've seen growth in EMEA. As I look at other parts of the world, Japan had an issue with an ingredient that Rodney spoke about in his narrative. And the rest of EMEA -- the rest of Asia Pacific, I'm sorry, seems also to be -- to continuing with growth, although not at the same rate as 2021. And we're monitoring the situation. But right now, volumes still seem to be healthy. Rodney Sacks : The only thing I would add is that we're seeing still a little bit of the effects of COVID in places like China and Japan, wher -- Hilton Schlosberg : In japan, that's correct. Rodney Sacks : A little bit of the volume there. But again, we think that's more COVID-related and that eventually is going to work its way through and then we think things will start to improve again there. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : Give us a sense of how much of your volume growth in the quarter was a result of pre-buying ahead of your price increase? Or did you really limit that? And then on your margins, could you give us a sense of how much of the expense of inventory is left and if it will be fully worked through by the end of this year? And then thinking about next year, and I'm well aware you don't guide, but is there any reason to think your gross margins can get back to the mid-50% range early next year, possibly Q1, especially given the pricing. You've already put in the market. You just mentioned it's sticking, and you did just announced some future pricing in international markets. So how should we think about the gross margin recovery? Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So that was quite a long question, Bonnie. Let's start at the very beginning. You spoke about these more expensive imported cans that we have in the system that we brought in to satisfy demand. If you look at cost of sales in the quarter, what we talk about is not a significant number, but will be worked through as we work through normal inventory, and we're anticipating it will be worked through over probably the next, I would say, 3 quarters. So that is something that we will work through in the ordinary course. The cans of many of green and white that we sell in the ordinary course. We sold them every day. And the comment on this quarter was that we had a major promotion with Apex Legends and its city to produce promotional cans overseas because you don't know when they'll arrive, if they'll arrive on time, if they arrive late. So we stick to our core SKUs for our international cans. So -- and you're right, we have had a price increase, and in the U.S., and we've had price increases internationally, we're having more price increases in 2023, as we enunciated on the discussion earlier. So prices are going up and prices going up in response to the inflationary costs that we've seen. As you know, inflation is rampant. But on the other hand, there are some good things that are coming out. We've seen freight rates coming down. There was a lot of capital expenditure put into new equipment and containers. So we've seen freight rates coming down. Fuel is where fuel is. It's very difficult to say what's going to happen with gas prices and diesel and fuel. Aluminum is coming down, but aluminum is one of those elusive commodities in our business because we -- part of our aluminum is hedged, part is bought on n minus 1. So you don't see a perfect improvement in aluminum prices when you look at a specific quarter. So there's -- we're seeing increases in commodities. We're seeing horrific increases in energy costs in Europe. And there's a bunch of costs that are continuing to compromise progress. But all in all, we believe that the price increases that we are putting into place should be able to be tolerated by the consumer and help mitigate some of the increased costs we've seen. Rodney Sacks : I would perhaps add on that is that, I mean, we all know that the inflation is continuing. I mean, you saw the increase in interest rates today again. So inflation, both in the U.S. and in Europe, is high. And if we continue to see inflation at those rates, I mean, we will review our margins. We'll review pricing, as I'm sure all other consumer product companies have done and will continue to do. And so we will review whether -- going into next year, whether they, in fact, pricing needs is justified in looking at an increase at that time in order to keep our margins reasonable. If we need to do that, we will review it. So just to let you know, we're open to it. But at this stage, we have the current increase, and we'll see how things go. But I think the whole world is going through -- is going to continue for some time to face a lot of inflation. And so whatever we say will be reviewed on a timely basis once we see where we are at, at the beginning of the year. Hilton Schlosberg : And the other comment -- sorry, I just wanted to respond to another comment that Bonnie made about buying. So we restricted customers, obviously, the distributors in buying in. We didn't give them cut launch. They were allowed to buy a modest amount. And as we look at the numbers for the quarter, we believe that the -- that whatever was purchased was probably sold in the quarter. That's the numbers we've seen. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Just a quick 2-parter, if you'd indulge me. Number one, if you could just confirm that your understanding is still that Red Bull is going to follow the magnitude of the price increase that you took, it's lagging a little bit in the Nielsen data. If you could just confirm that. My broader question is just on the recent distribution changes from some of your competitors with CELSIUS going into the Pepsi system, Bang coming out. Very common for that to create opportunity for incumbents like you guys and Red Bull in this instance. Can you just comment on your observations with respect to the state of those transitions? And how much of that disruption, particularly around Bang, do you think is contributing positively to your market share performance and how sticky that is? Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Rodney, do you want to start that one? Or do you want me to? Rodney Sacks : Yes. I'll sort of start that one. I think that the CELSIUS transition is -- will be interesting. But it's not all a panacea. It doesn't -- there's no magic in it. We think that they will then find increased distribution and increased number of outlets. I think that the discipline that a system like Pepsi will clearly introduce will also be a little bit negative on the flexibility and that they've been able to achieve or being able to enjoy through the beer distribution network. So you get pluses and minuses. And as you can see from the numbers, their strength continues to be in the grocery and large-format store channel. When you look at their numbers and sales per point in the convenience channel, there -- it's not as high. So I don't -- we don't believe that's going to have a major difference. There are a number of other brands that are all sort of getting some traction at a smaller level. I don't know what effect they're going to have. But overall, I think that we're getting a lot of our traction from the innovation and from execution and focus. And I think that will continue. Hilton Schlosberg : So let me go back to Kevin's question on Red Bull. Kevin, obviously, we can't comment on what they do and what they don't do. But our understanding is they imposed a price increase. And what we're seeing anecdotally is we're not seeing that price increase reflected in many cases at retail, to the extent that the increase was supposed to have have gone up. We, on the other hand, we've seen our prices move up strongly at retail. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I guess just following up on the last question, kind of thinking about shelf placement. So your overall placement has improved. I think you're still a little bit below where you were a couple of years ago, given some of the supply chain challenges. At the same time, you've got lots of innovation, probably more than I think most can remember in at least the last 10 years going into '23. So how do you think about your shelf space on a go-forward basis? Are you putting innovation in place of existing products, are you expanding your footprint on the shelf? And then if you think about the performance in functional category, CELSIUS, C4, GHOST, et cetera, are you seeing placement in the existing energy cooler? Or is that going into new coolers or different places within the existing coolers to a certain extent? Hilton Schlosberg : So let me start off, Mark. Our sales team has an objective because this is the time where we do shelf plans and shelf negotiations. And our sales team, both on the convenience side and on the large store side, are very active in achieving additional shelf space for our brands because we do feel that they are under spaced, and they do deserve further space relative to what's happening in the market. For example, in convenience, we sell more than single-serve sparkling beverages. So as a category, the energy category really requires more space relative to their fair share. And as such, our brand, which is growing, and we mentioned that we've overtaken Red Bull as a company with all -- the various brands and makeup. The company, our mission is to increase our shelf space at retail. I think we have to. Rodney Sacks : I think the other point that what's happening now is you've got this emergence of quite a few new brands who are getting distribution through the beer distribution network taking the place of where CELSIUS is and they're getting it. So we've got quite a few brands now putting pressure on the retailers to give additional space. There isn't additional space in the existing energy door. And what we've been trying for a few years is to obviously try and see where our own performance energy and other sort of allied energy brands are able to create a second door, additional shelving separate. And I think that is going to continue. I think that this emergence of a lot of new products in the convenience category, in particular, will result in an expansion of space where -- so hopefully, we believe we will be able to get additional space in the traditional draw for our innovation and our energy product and as well as space for our additional brands and our performance products like Rain and Rainstorm together with a lot of the other performance or clean energy products in additional doors. So we think that will actually happen and will improve this year. But that's always the challenge. You've always got to try and -- you got a certain amount of fixed shelves and you've got to try and increase your space. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. But remember, the category is growing here, Mark. And that in and of itself, that's a factor for the retailer. The space that they allocate to energy generates them really good returns, really good revenue. And it's something -- space is something that we always strive for, including putting our own coolers in retailers. So that's a big push for us, and always has been. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Peter Galbo : I'll be pretty quick. Just to clarify, Hilton, your fourth quarter gross margins, you're going to be lapping, I guess, the promo benefit from 3Q, but should we still expect a sequential improvement in the gross margin? Or is that promo benefit you saw in the third quarter enough that you'd be actually down quarter-on-quarter into 4Q? Hilton Schlosberg : The difficulty, Peter, is that we don't give guidance. So it's hard to give guidance because we don't give it. But let me just leave you with a thought when you talk about gross margins that the price increase was effective September 1. So we basically had 1 month of a price increase. We will have 3 months of a price increase in December. While we may have additional costs, we will still have that benefit of the price increase for the fourth quarter. Operator : And at this time, we will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call.

The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter, 6.2% higher than net sales of $1.43 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 11.9% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global supply chain challenges and disruptions, the company has prioritized product availability for its consumers and customers, despite adversely impacting gross margins and operating income. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. CANarchy was acquired in February 2022 to facilitate the company's entry into the alcohol beverage sector. During 2022, CANarchy sustained margin pressures, cost of acquisition and integration, as well as certain other costs in preparation for the launch of the company's new alcohol product lines. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was 51.8% compared with 53.9% in the comparative 2021 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter as compared to the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of : one, increased ingredients and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, geographical and product sales mix; and three, increased logistical costs. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters and should be fully utilized during 2023. We note that our major promotion in the fourth quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally. We estimate that of the increasing costs of sales in the 2022 fourth quarter, approximately $60 million, was comprised of one, approximately $39.6 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including primary and secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, approximately $12.5 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and three, approximately $7.9 million due to increased logistical costs. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are starting to see a reduction in freight rates in the United States. Operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter was $390 million compared with $354.7 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter were 25.8% compared with 24.9% in the 2021 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter increased to $76.1 million which is an increase of 9% or 5% of net sales compared to $69.8 million or 4.9% of net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The $6.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.2 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA, partially offset by decreased freight out expenses of $4.4 million. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses and increased general and administrative expenses. We are now able to purchase aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans, as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.5% to $394.4 million from $412.9 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 6.1% to $301.7 million, as compared to $321.3 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.9% to $0.57 from $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share, exclusive of the Alcohol segment operating losses and the adverse impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, net of tax, was $0.64 in the 2022 fourth quarter. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022, and will be implementing a price increase on its 24-ounce line effective April 1, 2023. The company also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases on a phased approach during the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 11, 2023, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 13.1% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 11, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 15.1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, increased 14.8% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel.

Monster share decreased from 31.5% a year ago to 30.9%. Reign's share increased 0.2 of a share point to 2.7%. NOS' share increased 0.2 point to 2.6%. And Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Red Bull share decreased 1 point from 36.1% a year ago to 35.1%. VPX Bang share decreased 3.8 points to 3.1%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.6 of a point at 3.9%. Rockstar share was down 0.3 of a point to 3.7%. CELSIUS' share is 4.3%. Alani Nu\u2019s share is 0.7%. And GHOST's share is 2.5%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 11, 2023, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel, increased 6.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 8.1% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 8% higher. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended February 11, 2023, was 54.7%, up 1 point while Starbucks Energy share was 44.9%, up 0.8 of a point.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 26.6% for the month of January 2023. Monster sales increased 34.1%. Monster's market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 106.2%, and its market share increased 2 share points to 5.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2022 compared to December 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 43% to 53.5%, in Chile, from 34.5% to 41.7%. In Brazil for the month end January 2023, our share increased from 39.9% to 41.1%. Monster is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.2% to 15.2% in Belgium, from 30.7% to 31.8% in France from 29.5% to 31% in Great Britain, from 27.3% to 32.7% in Norway, from 27.7% to 27.8% in the Republic of Ireland, from 38.6% to 40.4% in Spain and from 15.1% to 16.5% in Sweden.

According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ending January 29, 2023, increased from 13.1% to 16.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 11% to 10.7%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended January 22, 2023, and remained at 13% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 6.7% to 6.1%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 5.8% to 6%. According to INTAGE in Japan in the month of ending December 2022, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 53.7% to 54.7%. According to Nielsen in South Korea in the month ending December 23 to Monster's market share in value in all after it's combined as compared to the same period the previous year, increased from 60.2% to 64.2%. Again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the US were $542.5 million, 35.9% of total net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter compared to $508.1 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in US dollars by approximately $81.9 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the US, transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 2.3% in dollars, but increased 14.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter, was 33.9% compared with 32.6% in the same quarter in 2021 and compared to 34.7% in the third quarter of 2022. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in this supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in 2022 fourth quarter increased 0.5 point in dollars and increased 20.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.6% versus 41.4% over the same period in 2021. Due in part to a product supply issue with an ingredient that impacted a number of our products in Japan, but has now been resolved, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 14.4% in dollars, but increased 10% in local currency. Sales in the 2022 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by COVID in certain channels. In South Korea, net sales increased 13.9% in dollars and increased 34.4% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Once the remains -- in China, sales volume in the fourth quarter increased 5.4%, as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 2.9% in dollars and 16.7% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter increased 45.2% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 92% in dollars and increased 196.6% in local currency in the 2022 fourth quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company, or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorney fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment. Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. The parties are briefing post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential claw-backs in certain circumstances. On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As the litigation and bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call. In the first quarter of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed in six states through a network of beer distributors. The Beast Unleashed is a flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles. We are pleased with early results and plan to expand into additional markets in the second quarter of 2023, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We recently launched Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's Beer family will get a refresh in the second quarter of 2023, including the introduction of Dale's American light lager and easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbohydrates per 12-ounce serving. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future. In the 2022 fourth quarter in the United States, Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle was launched at retail to expand our Monster Reserve line. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched at retail in United States in January 2023. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. Earlier this month, we also launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster Cafe Latte. Initial response from consumers has been positive. In February 2023, we launched the flavor of Reign called Tropical Storm in the United States and also commenced with the launch of Monster Tour Water, a pure unflavored water line in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans. We are planning to launch Reign Storm, which is positioned as a total wellness energy drink in 12-ounce sleek cans at retail in March 2023 in four flavors to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. We launched several new SKUs in October in Latin America. In Chile, we expanded our Ultra line by launching Ultra Gold and Ultra Watermelon. In Mexico, we introduced Monster Energy Reserve Watermelon. In Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, Curico and Bermuda, we expanded our Reign portfolio and launched Reign White Gummy Bear and Reign Rainbow Sorbet. In Trinidad and Tobago, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch. In Australia, we expanded our core portfolio and launched Monster Super Dry. In New Zealand, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juice Papillon, which is currently exceeding our expectations. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro, Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched juiced Aussie Lemonade, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 fourth quarter. During the 2022 fourth quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA as part of an ongoing plan, EMEA launch, we commenced distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be followed by an additional 25 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Rehab Lemon tea in Japan, Monster Ultra Watermelon in Turkey. Monster Ultra Paradise in Vietnam, Predator in Malaysia, and we continued the national rollout of Predator India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC during the course of 2023. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, January 2023 sales were approximately 16.1% higher than the comparable January 2022 sales and 13.8% higher than January 2022, excluding CANarchy. We estimate January 2023 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in January 2022 and 10.6% higher than in January 2022, excluding CANarchy. January 2023 had the same number of selling days as January 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partner maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continues in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock for a total amount of $201.6 million, excluding broker commissions under the June 2022 repurchase plan, leaving approximately 682.8 million remaining available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. The company today announced that its Board of Directors has approved and declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock that will be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on March 13, 2023, will receive a dividend of one additional share of common stock for each then held share to be distributed after the close of trading on March 27, 2023. The company anticipates its common stock to begin trading at the split adjusted price on March 28, 2023. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service customers and ensure availability of its products. Three, we are seeing improvement in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis due to supply chain normalization; four, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our EMEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for only 23 new product innovations notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, which launched in January 2023 in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero sugar energy drink in EMEA. We are also particularly enthusiastic for the planned launches of rainstorm in March 2023 as well as Tour Water in the United States. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product in six states and the planned rollout to additional states, as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. And finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the year. Thank you. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good evening or good afternoon everyone. So, Hilton, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margin. You mentioned in the release that you expect some of these cost pressures you\u2019ve experience to be transitory, whereas others remain challenging. And I guess maybe just to start, is there any way to frame how much of the drag on gross margin is still a result of these imported cans? And then just looking ahead in the context of pricing, the cost backdrop you've outlined and kind of the modest sequential improvement we saw sequentially, how would you frame the margin recapture opportunity looking out to next year? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Well, if you look back at what happened in the fourth quarter, we had a price increase in September 1 in the US. We had some price increases internationally during 2022 and into the fourth quarter of 2022. We are increasing pricing in many international markets on a phased basis starting in the early part of 2023. So, a lot of the increased costs that we have been absorbing should be accommodated by increased pricing. But looking forward, we all know what's happening with aluminum. It's coming down. Certain other commodities are coming down. In Europe, we see energy coming down. So overall, I think with regard to margin, we are actually in a good place. And as you saw in this quarter, we were able to move margin on a sequential basis. We do, however, have certain costs that are not going away. For example, co-packing fees have gone up. The sugar is in tight supply because of weather situations. So, there are positives as well as negatives in the system. As regards to the international cans, we don't have that significant quantity left in terms of what the impact will be on gross margin. So, I think we've just got to work through those cans. They are green and ultra-white. We'll look through them and will be good. The only issue is that we do have promotional cans from time to time. And as I've spoken on this call on a number of occasions, these cans are not promotional cans. They're just straight cans that we use in non-promotional periods. And also, it depends -- we have other obligations with our can companies. So, it's a question of sourcing cans on the most optimal place to be able to co-pack. So that may be too long an explanation, but I hope it gave you a sense of what we're seeing from the sand. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi everyone. So, I just wanted to follow-up on that, but then ask question. So, Hilton, would you expect sequential gross margin improvement from here on steady clip just given pricing and some improvement in commodities or overall cost inflation. I appreciate there are other inflationary factors. But would you expect to continue to sequentially improve from here? So that's just a follow-up. But then from a US perspective, I think one of the things that's coming up tonight is, you had mid-single-digit pricing to high-single-digit pricing in the US in September and yet US sales were 6%. So, can you talk to any -- was there any pull forward of demand because of the pricing actions? Were there any promotions in the quarter behind the pricing? Maybe can you just help reconcile the revenue growth in the quarter in the US, which is basically in line with the pricing that you're taking? So, thanks for that follow-up on gross margins in the US comment. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Chris, to answer your first question, we don't give guidance. And I actually gave quite a robust explanation of what we see the runway for margins. So, I just really don't want to estimate it because we really don't give guidance. But I think I gave you a good sense of where we are, probably too much, but that is where it is. In respect of the price increase in the US in September, we actually limited the bottlers to the extent of how much they could buy in. So, I don't think that there was -- in fact, we don't think there was any much pull forward from Q3. I think it was just a question of the market stabilizing. As you know, with when price increases are put into effect, there's always a little bit of a bump as you go into more steady waters. And everything we know and that we've heard is the price really -- the price increase is actually sticking. So, we had a little bit more promotional allowances in the fourth quarter, and you'll see that in the K is released, but that's really consistent with bleeding in a price increase to a market in the consumer goods industry. Rodney Sacks : I think the only other thing I would like to just -- maybe just to add on that is that towards the end of the fourth quarter, I think we were not alone. I think there was a number of companies felt some softness in the consumer pool in -- primarily in December. But that was -- and that happened. And then we think we've seen an uptick again in January as we've indicated from our January numbers and you can see from the Nielsen numbers. So, it probably was a little bit of a combination of just an initial hesitancy from consumers to the price increase and then ultimately just some consumer softness, but that seems to have remedies itself in the first quarter now? Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Drew Levine : Hi. Thank you. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking our questions. So, Ron, I want to continue on that point on the sort of rebound in January, and it also seemed like there was an acceleration for both Monster and the category on a three-year stack or three year CAGR basis. So just wondering what you're sort of attributing that underlying strength in consumption too, do you think it's the new product launches, increased interest in the category, gas prices coming down? So, any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thank you. Rodney Sacks : I think it's a combination of those things. I think we have got gas prices coming down. I think we have seen sort of now sort of increase in convenience. I remember, last year. Convenience was always ahead of the grocery and mass channels. And last year has sort of reversed, and convenience was a little slow. That seems to be coming back a little bit. And we just think that, again, pricing has sort of settled down a bit. But you can see across the whole category, there has been an increase in the Nielsen numbers across the category for most people and our competitors. So, we're just are seeing just a little bit of resurgence of confidence again. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes, the other thing I think you should do is have a look at the -- when we announced third quarter results, we spoke about the October sales. And if you look at the October sales, it's not inconsistent with the quarter. And I'll talk about the fourth quarter of 2022, sorry. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good afternoon. So hopefully, you're doing all right there, Rodney. Rodney Sacks : Yes, I\u2019m fine. Just sort of remnants of a cough for the last couple of weeks. Mark Astrachan : All right. That's good. Two questions for you. One sort of related to the recent line of questioning. So, inventories were up again sequentially. How do we think about the improvement there? And does that kind of lead into flow-through of improvement in gross margin through 2023? And maybe more bigger picture, how do you think about the relative affordability of Monster and energy drinks broadly in the US after the price increase? It seems like you think that other beverage categories. Pricing has been steady riser over the last decade plus, so the gap has sort of narrowed. You took a little bit of pricing, but not nearly as much on a cumulative basis. Is there opportunity here to become more price rationale from an energy category standpoint as you kind of move forward? Hilton Schlosberg : Well, let's talk about the first question, Mark, about inventories. As you know, when we went out of 2021, our inventories were just too low. We were unable to service our customers without major upheavals and without major costs. So, we -- there was no question that the inventories had to move and move significantly up because bearing in mind where our sales are. But as we are, we believe that we have sufficient inventories, which is important for us to be able to service our customers. Are we working on getting those inventories down? Yes. And these inventories will optimize themselves in due course. So, I wouldn't be concerned. Our products have a two-year shelf life, and it's important that we maintain sufficient inventories to service our customers. And then on that second question you asked about pricing, if you know and look, for example, at a Mountain Dew at Walmart, a 20-ounce Mountain Dew Walmart, their price is $2.18. And Monster is $2.28, so we -- I think as you look at the energy category and you kind of balance the pricing of 20-ounce sodas and energy drinks. Remember that we now -- and just twisting over to convenience, we sell more -- energy drink sell more at convenience than carbonated soft drinks. So, there is a balance. And I think we have struck a very good balance. With regard to going forward, we have a price increase planned for 24-ounce, which we believe has got opportunity, and we're taking price in 24-ounce up beginning of April. So that will happen. And we'll continue to monitor the opportunities for price increases in the US, as we see margins and as we see the carbonated soft drink category, and it's a whole bundle of issues that lead us to move in the direction of whether to take price. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Sacks : Hi. Filippo Falorni : Can you talk about your expectations for your innovation pipeline in 2023, particularly on a relative basis over the last couple of years, given it seems like you have a pretty substantial pipeline this year, both in alcoholic beverage and your core energy drinks? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : The fact is that I think that we've actually got a really broad base of innovation, I think that it has sort of improved over the last few years, and I think we're sort of getting it right. I think that will be positive for the brand. We also are being able to secure a little more shelf space across the different channels, which is helping us with innovation, because in some cases, we didn't get shelf spaces in some of the years past, and it was sort of difficult to actually get the innovation to achieve the benefits that we had hoped for. We think that this year, we will be able to achieve those benefits. We have rationalized some of the SKUs. And we think that we'll be able to get a good selection of our innovation on shelf, particularly the new energy Zero Sugar and also the new Reign subline, which will going to go up against other competitors in the 12-ounce category. And there has been some additional shelf space, not only in the energy category, but also in the sort of wellness category. So, I think in some places, we'll also be able to place the Reign Storm sort of line in that area as well. So overall, we think there will be a good contribution going forward from innovation, which is exciting. And so far, initial response to things like our Ultra Strawberry Dreamsicle has been really positive from consumers and bottlers to the Zero Sugar and others. So, we are pretty optimistic and upbeat about innovation this year. Also, we were introducing a lot of multipacks to try and increase the take home, particularly in places like grocery. So again, we haven't described them that much on this call, but there's a whole skew of multipack and variety packs that we're doing in a multipack, which we think will be positive for the brand this year for sales. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey. Thanks, and good evening. Just I guess a couple of cleanups on the gross margin topic. The first one is, Rodney, I think at the start of the call, you bridged to a $60 million increase in COGS. I just wanted to clarify what that was. I think if I'm not mistaken, COGS is up like $70 million-plus. So just exactly what those numbers were and what they weren't, number one? Number two, I don't know if you can comment on the mix of cans in the fourth quarter, old higher cost cans versus current cost cans and if that was materially different than what you had seen in the third quarter? And then three, the Latin America gross margin, you called out, sales growth there is fantastic, but the gross margin has been progressively under pressure and was down, I think, 10-plus points in the fourth quarter. Just the drivers there and if you think you've got the ability to turn that gross margin progress around in Latin America? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : I think, Steve, we spoke about that about margins earlier on the call. Margins on a sequential basis were actually up. So, I'm really not sure what you're referring to. And the first question that we answered spoke -- I spoke quite heavily about the progression of gross margins and the pluses and the minuses. So maybe I'm missing something, but I think we did discuss margin earlier on the call. And with regard to the $60 million that we spoke about in the release, that was only -- the $60 million was comprised of $39.6 million due to increased ingredients in other input costs and 12.5 due to geographical product sales mix and 7.9 due to increased logistical costs. And the rest of the increase in cost of sales was normal increases as you would expect to -- in a normal business environment. Those are the kind of the exceptional ones that we called out. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottling system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

The company achieved record first quarter net sales of 1.7 billion in the 2023 first quarter, 11.9% higher than net sales of 1.52 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 15.3% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter was 52.8% compared with 51.1% in the comparative 2022 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter as compared to the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight in costs, and decreased aluminum can costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.8% in the 2023 first quarter, from 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter, and 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's alcohol brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 53.6% in the 2023 first quarter, from 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter, and 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. The depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters but should be fully utilized during 2023. Operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter were 412.8 million, compared to 377.2 million in the 2022 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter, were 24.3% compared with 24.8% in the 2022 first quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2023 first quarter decreased to 76.3 million or 4.5% of net sales, compared to 81.4 million or 5.4% of net sales in the 2022 first quarter. The 5.1 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of 15.7 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of 9.9 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. We're now purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. Operating income for the 2023 first quarter increased 21.4% to 485.1 million from 399.5 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 first quarter was 20.1% compared with 25% in the 2022 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the increase in the stock compensation deduction in the 2023 first quarter. Net income increased 35.1% to 397.4 million as compared to 294.2 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 first quarter increased 36.6% to $0.38 from $0.27 in the first quarter of 2022. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022, as well as in many other international markets in 2022, and in the first quarter of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. In the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24-ounce lines, effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2023 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Energy Shots increased by 12.7% versus the same period a year ago.

The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category all outlets combined in the United States in both a 13 week and 4-week periods ended April 22, 2023. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended April 22, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shops in dollars increased 12.7%, over the same period of previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, increased 11% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 9.3% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 37.8%, NOS was up 8.8% and Full Throttle was up 11.7%. Sales of Red Bull were up 9.8%, Rockstar was up 5.4% and 5-Hourwas down 5.8%. VPX Bang sales decreased 59.5%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended April 22, 2023, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars decreased from 37.5% to 36.9%. Once the share decreased from 31.6% a year ago to 30.6%, Reign share increased a half a share point to 2.9%, NOS share remained at 2.6 and Full Throttle share remind 0.7 of a percent. Red Bull share decreased 0.9 points from 35.2% a year ago to 34.3%. The VPX Bang share decreased 4.2 points to 2.4%, 5-Hour share was lower by [5.7] [ph] points, -- at 3.7%, Rockstar share was down point to 2 of a point to 3.4% CELSIUS share is 5.4%, C4 share is 2.8% and Ghost share is 2.9%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended April 22, 2023 sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 0.8 of a percent over the same period the previous year. To other Java Monster including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew was 0.6% higher the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks energy were 4.7% higher. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the four weeks ended April 22, 2023 was 55.1% down point one of a point while Starbucks energy share was 44.5% at 1.6 points.

Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 19.5% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brand was 43.1% up 1.7 points. Monster\u2019s sales increased 19.7% and its marketing increased 1.6 points to 38.6. NOS sales increased 4.2% and its market share decreased by point one of a point to 1.3%. Full Throttle sales decreased 8.4% and its market share decreased point one of a point to 0.4%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 17.8% for the month of March 2023. Monster\u2019s sales increased 24.8%. Monsters\u2019 market share in value increased 1.7 points to 30% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 71.3% and its market share increased 1.7 share points to 5.4%. The Nielsen statistics from Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2023 compared to March 2022, Monster's retail market sharing value increased in Argentina to 53.5% and in Chile from 36.4% to 42.7%. In Brazil for the month end March 2023, our share increased from 42.1% to 43.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13th week period until the end of March 2023, once this retail market share in value is compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.8% to 15.8% in Belgium, from 18.3% to 20.9%, in the Czech Republic, from 32.4% to 33.4%, in France, from 15% to 16.6% in Germany, from 29.3% to 30.9%, in Great Britain, or 28.2% to 30.4% Italy, from 29.7% to 34.6% in Norway, from 27.9% to 28.7% in the Republic of Ireland, from 38.2% to 39.9% in Spain, and from 15.9% or 18.1% in Sweden.

According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month of ending March 2023, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year, decreased from 59.4% to 56.8%. We again point out months, certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $622.9 million, 36.7% of total net sales in the 2023 first quarter, compared to 553.4 million or 36.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars, by approximately $52 million in the 2023 first quarter, included in reported geographic sales, or our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.

We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration, in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company or MEC and Orange Bank, Inc., 175 million in damages, attorneys fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy product. VPX has appealed the judgment. Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately 293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference of Monster's contract over shelf space with certain key retailers. On April 12 2023, the district court granted MECs motion for permanent injunction which amongst other things and joins VPX and former CEO, Jack Owoc from falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang or any other beverages contain creatine or a form of creatine. The parties have completed briefing the remaining post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries, and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, the VPX is undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential claw back in certain circumstances. On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately 3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they're realized or realizable. As this litigation and bank bankruptcy proceedings are sub-judicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call. In the first quarter, we initially launched the Beast Unleashed in six states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution into additional markets with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Net sales for Beast unleashed during the first quarter were 20.5 million. We recently relaunched Wild Bass and Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. We are refreshing the Dale's Beer brand and we'll be introducing Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. We are planning to launch a new flavored malt beverage line within the next few months. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing news of additional new product in the near future. We launched the number of new products in the United States in 2023 first quarter. In January 2023, Monster Energy zero sugar was launched at retail. Monster Energy zero sugar is available in 16-ounce cans and was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analogue of our original unique Monster Energy green flavor. In February 2023, we launched a new flavor within our highly successful Monster Ultra line with Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams available in 16-ounce cans. In March 2023, we launched Reign Storm, which is positioned as a line of total wellness energy drinks in 12-ounce sleek cans to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. Reign Storm is available in four flavors, Valencia Orange, Kiwi Blend, Peach Nectarine and Harvest Grape. Also in March, we launched Rehab Monster Wildberry Tea in 16-ounce cans. We are continuing to expand the distribution of Monster Tour Water in still and sparkling variants into additional states. We launched several new SKUs in the first quarter in 2023 in Canada. In February 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen, Punch Monster Ozzy Style Lemonade and Reign Rainbow Sherbet. In March 2023, we launched Monster zero sugar in Canada. There were several new SKUs in the 2023 first quarter in Latin America. In Brazil, we launched Monster Ultra Watermelon. Additionally, we revamped our previous Chaos product into the new Monster Juice Chaotic. In Mexico, Predator [indiscernible] at retail to further expand our affordable energy offerings. In Uruguay, we launched our second Ultra SKU with Monster Ultra Paradise. In Paraguay and Bolivia, we launched our first juice SKU with Monster Juice Manga Loca and additionally in Bolivia, we launched Fury Goldstrike. The first quarter of 2023 in Australia, we launched two Java Monster SKUs, Java Monster Mean Bean and Java Monster Loca Moca. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Juicy Ozzy Lemonade and Juice Chaotic in a number of countries. During the 2023, first quarter we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA as part of an ongoing Pan EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink to an additional 22 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023, will be followed by another eight markets in the second quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In April 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan, we are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand statement, April 2023, sales were approximately 9.9% higher than the comparable April 22 sales and 7.9% higher than April 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate April 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment, to be approximately 7.2% higher than in April 2022 and 5.1% higher than in April 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. April 2023 had one less selling day compared to April 2022. In this regard, we caution again, that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production shared goals. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter, or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally. Two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions, which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, we are seeing improvements in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis. Four, our AFF Flavor Facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our EMEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Reign Storm and Pure Water in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar in EMEA. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We are excited by the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the initial results of our launch of Reign Storm, our new line of Total Wellness energy drinks. Eight, finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands, and additional number of international countries. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Grom : So maybe just two quick margin questions, if I may. So, one, I know you don't want to get into guidance, but you continue to comment on the sequential margin performance or improvement. So with pricing, coming in and cost moderating, should we expect to see sequential improvement in gross margin from here as we move through the year? And then, just somewhat related, as we look at selling expense as a percentage of sales today versus 2019? It's down quite a bit. So as we look ahead, is this high single digit rate that we've seen over the past couple of years sustainable? Or would you be looking to take that higher over time, particularly as gross margin begins to improve? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So addressing your first question on gross margin, as you know, we don't give guidance. But what we can say and what we have said in previous quarters, and where we've spoken about the price increases, we have [rolling] [ph] price increases in EMEA during the whole year. So that will escalate as the year goes through. In the U.S., we had a price increase, as you know, late last year, and we had a price increase on April 1 in larger sizes the 19.2, 18.4 and the 24 ounce can. So that's something that will be reflected continually as the year goes through. In addition, we took up some pricing later on in the year in LATAM and some in LATAM in 2023, as well. In Asia Pacific, we largely took up pricing in Q1 of this year. So they will be a benefit, I believe from pricing as we go through 2023. With regard to costs, that's something that we continue to evaluate. We know that, for example, aluminum has kind of stabilized which is positive for, I think, for us. And we've also had a situation where we've seen freight rates reducing, and we balanced freight in two sections in our P&L trade-in for materials and for finished goods as they move to distribution centers are regarded as part of cost of sales and freight-out is obviously regarded as an operating expense. So we are seeing some improvements. We mentioned, I think on previous calls, and in the script today, that there are some challenges in our cost of sales, including what we're seeing certain ingredients, and co-packing fees. So overall, I think, I could see a situation where we have the price -- we have the price benefits, they seem as if the -- they have been sensibly executed and that we haven't had major resistance from customers. So I think that gives you the background probably to make your own assessment. And then on your second question on selling expenses, we work towards a budget on selling expenses, which we believe are necessary to execute our play. And what those budgets are and where they end up is a factor that we very seriously consider in dealing with the needs of our consumer and the needs of the market. So, we don't really compare it to themselves and at the end of the quarter everybody else does. But we look at the needs of the marketing programs, and what we need to do to keep our brands exciting and in the eyes of the consumers. Operator : Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Filippo Falorni : You talked about the energy drink category remaining solid, can you talk about what you're expecting in the balance of the year for the category, are you seeing any signs of potential weakness at the low end of the consumer base, or you're seeing trends held up in the U.S. particularly? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : So we don't give guidance, Rodney, you go ahead and respond to that. Rodney Sacks : Go ahead. Hilton Schlosberg : No, please. Now you go ahead, that's fine. Rodney Sacks : We don't give guidance and the category has in line with other consumer products in a little bit of a slowing, I think there's been a lot of price increases across not only the energy category, but all beverage and consumer product. And so there has been a little bit of slowing, I think there's been a little bit of trimming of benefits under the snap programs that were increased during COVID. And those are sort of being pulled back a little bit generally now. So I think you would see a little bit of a sort of rationalization by buyers as they have slightly less disposable income. But again, I think that will settle down. We are overall though, if you look at the numbers, we gave you the Nielsen numbers, there is still healthy growth in the energy drink category as a category, it's continuing to grow and expand. But other than the direction you're seeing from Nielsen, we really can't, and won't give any further direction. But obviously, we think that certainly in dollar terms, the category will continue to grow. In actual volumes, they may be a little bit of a slowing. But I think that we will think that it'll be more than made above by dollar increases in pricing. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Bonnie Herzog : I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the innovation, just maybe a little more color on, Zero Sugar, the Beast, Reign Storm, and how they're performing and whether they're meeting your expectations in terms of buy-in from retailers and shelf space allocation. I guess I'm hearing you got a fair amount of incremental space. So just wanted to verify that with you. And then wanted to understand on Zero Sugar in particular, [Technical Difficulty] most of that during Q1 or you still expecting to kind of roll that out in certain market in Q2? Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So if you look at Zero Sugar, we launched Zero Sugar, we rolled it out in Q1. So most markets by far the majority rolled out Zero Sugar in Q1. As regards Zero Sugar, we have actually been very pleased with the results. We had good expectations for the product and our expectations seem to have been realized. We're not seeing a big dip in green. So a lot of people have asked questions about cannibalization. But we're not seeing a big dip in green at all. I mean, green seems very much to be holding its own. So I think that as we look at shelf space, obviously we've negotiated very actively this year for additional shelf space. And we have achieved really commendable increases in shelf space. Not only in convenience, not only in the convenience independence, but across the various channels. Rodney Sacks : The only thing I would add is, Bonnie, internationally, we do have plans to also roll up the Zero Sugar into a number of international markets but that it's not going to go everywhere at the same time we have other things on the agenda today need to roll out. So there'll be an orderly rollout of other innovation internationally, but in many markets including in EMEA, we will be rolling up to Zero Sugar as well. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. And we just launched in Canada as well. So really exciting times, I think for that particular product. Rodney Sacks : Now with regard to the expectations, Bonnie's, Reign Storm really was launched right at the end of the first quarter. So it's just too early to tell. But obviously, we are optimistic about it. Again, and with regard to the Beast, we rolled it out slowly. And we are trying to do that in a cautious way. And we so far, the result, sales, some of the repeat sales have also been encouraging. And but again, it's early on, we have a lot of additional innovation in alcohol that we are looking at and planning. So we were quite excited, it just takes time. And we are rolling it out through this whole new distribution system, which we are continuing to build distributed by distributor, so it's taking time to get there. But as we said on the call, we hope to be national, by the end of the year, we hope to have additional product. So the whole system, I think is working, moving forward according to plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Carey : Just one clarification or maybe if you can help the 18.6 and the 24 ounce? How meaningful are those as a percentage of your overall portfolio? Or is there just any way to frame the size of that price increase as a contribution to total business? And then, just a bigger picture one, that I feel a little bit, but I get questions pretty often just about succession planning and long-term succession planning on Monster and how strong is the bench, and how much of that bench building is going on behind closed doors. It just comes up enough that, I thought maybe this could be an interesting place to just maybe offer some perspective on just how you think about developing talent and developing talent for the long-term. So, thanks for the -- maybe a little bit of help on the scope of the pricing and just on talent development. Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : Chris, I would refer you to the Nielsen numbers. And you'll see that those larger sizes are less than 10%, probably in the 6% to 8% range. But if you look at Nielsen, you'll be able to get a good assessment of that percentage. Secondly, on succession, obviously, the Monster Board is, and Rodney and myself are really concerned about succession. And something that we are addressing, and we continue to address on an ongoing basis. We have a very, in our view, a deep strength in the bench of the team below us that are being developed and are growing and we are helping them develop. So I think from that perspective, it's something that ourselves, the board, are very well aware of. And we'll continue to address that issue. However, I don't think Rodney is going anywhere in the foreseeable future and frankly, neither am I. So we are here and will help develop and segue when the time is right, a new management team. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Andrea Teixeira : I just have a clarification. So went back to Bonnie's question on how accretive Monster Zero has been against Ultra. In absolute terms in numbers in the U.S. it seems there has been a great launch based on the Nielsen data. But it obviously as you look at Ultra, it also has been coming at some deceleration which Obviously one would expect. Can you comment on who your first of all, how is it tracking against plan? And in terms of shelf productivity that you pointed out that you're gaining distribution and trying to make it obviously accretive? How is it number one tracking against plan. And number two, how you're seeing that, going above and beyond Ultra? Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So remember that we had a product called Absolutely Zero. And Zero Sugar is really the new variant of Absolutely Zero. So it's a product that was in the market that has been replaced by Zero Sugar. So when you compare the numbers for Zero Sugar, you can see that on an ACV basis, we moved from 42% from Absolutely Zero to 72%, for Zero Sugar. So the distribution of Zero Sugar is increasing, and it's climbing. It's not that it's a new product. We had, as I said, a product called Absolutely Zero. And so when we look at Zero Sugar, we look at our plans, we look at our plans for Ultra, we have been very satisfied so far, with the launch of Zero Sugar. You look at the ACV growth. And the sales per point and it's something that we really as -- and I said this earlier, we really are very excited with Zero Sugar. Rodney Sacks : Just maybe I will just add on the Ultra side. We have had a really successful launch of Ultra Strawberry Dreams. I think that some of the ACV, if you look at your Nielsen's, you'll see some of the ACV or some of the additional flavors Ultra -- Ultra Heavy in fact decreased a little bit. I think that's something we just need to look at and attend, I think as you get go through this change and introducing of new flavor, sometimes -- some of these additional SKUs that are not the top three, or four or five, sometimes get a little bit lost in the wash. So that's where we've seen a little bit of a drop-off in some of those additional flavors. But I think there's -- we think that there are solid and sound products and I think, we just need -- just really make sure we focus on just reestablishing some of the distribution levels on those. And we think those sales will continue to increase. Sales of Ultra as a brand or sub-brand have gone up in the United States and internationally. But I think that we've had, as I said, some of those flanker sort of flavors are, we need to just put some focus behind which we are doing. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Astrachan : Two housekeeping questions. One cash balance, it keeps growing. Any thoughts on how you'd like to implement spending some of it share repurchase? It was nice to see there were some interest income this quarter, I assume we shouldn't be thinking to that continues to grow. And then, on the alcohol brands gross margin, the implied number this quarter was a little better sequentially than 4Q, anything is there kind of beneath the surface that we should consider and trying to model that business because it's clearly a lot harder to see what's going on there. And then sort of the legacy business. Thanks. Rodney Sacks : On the alcohol side, I think that what we did was -- we had quite a drop off in the seltzer business that which is part of the brands that we acquired, and that affected in operating business where they're running their own production that affected their overhead costs, because you've got some fixed costs. So as you noted in the earlier, last quarter of last year, we reported on the margins were really very [indiscernible] on the -- what we call the legacy business. Those margins are improving. We're busy sort of refitting the one line out to be able to increase the capacity for doing the Beast products. And as we go forward, we will start seeing an improvement in the margin in the legacy business. The margins on the Beast side are healthier, quite a lot better than on the legacy craft business side. And as again, those are probably smaller, lower now than they'll be as we start of getting some scale, we are doing some co-packing, we will be using our own facility and we will obviously be maximizing that. And as we go forward, we will start working on using additional co-pack as we will actually lower our costs. So we do think there will be additional margin going forward, but it is a thinner margin product, and we obviously are traditionally used to seeing on the Monster side. And maybe Hilton, you want to take the question on the cash side. Go ahead. Hilton Schlosberg : Mark, we continually are examining options to deal with our cash balances, and it's something that, again, is a board issue that is receiving attention. So, I really don't want to comment, more than we have that -- intention is to hopefully buy back shares continue that program. But we are looking at -- some opportunities for further investments. And that's too premature to talk about them. But there are a number of possibilities that that we're looking at. And in addition, it is our plan to continue buying back our shares. Endof Q&A: Operator : And, at this time, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, all for the company. I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy. And we remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola Bottlers System. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. And thank you for your attendance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.85 billion in the 2023 second quarter, 12.1% higher than net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 14.4% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter was 52.5% compared with 47.1% in the comparative 2022 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter as compared to the 2022 second quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased operating costs and increased aluminum can costs. The increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in the alcohol segment and in which our sales had quite a nice bump as you seen from the release. As expected, promotional allowances for the 2023 second quarter were marginally higher than the comparable 2022 second quarter, as well as 2023 first quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 second quarter were $450.4 million, compared with $406.9 million in the 2022 second quarter, as a percentage of net sales operating expenses for the 2023 second quarter were 24.3% compared to 24.6% in the 2022 second quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2023 second quarter decreased to $82 million, or 4.4% of net sales compared to $87.9 million or 5.3% of net sales in the 2022 second quarter. The $5.8 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of $11.8 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. We are purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have returned to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The costs of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. The company continues to address certain challenges in its supply chain as it navigates the current global supply chain environment. Operating income for the 2023 second quarter increased 14.4% to $523.8 from $373 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 second quarter was 23.2% compared with 25.3% in the 2022 second quarter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense, a decrease in the effective state income tax rate, as well as an increase in net income in certain foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates compared to the United States. Net income increased 51.4% to $413.9 million, as compared to $273.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 second quarter increased 52.8% to $0.39 from $0.26 in the second quarter of 2022. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022, as well as in many other international markets in 2022, and in the first half of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. In the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24 ounce lines effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2023 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Energy Shots increased by 13.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, including Reign were up 12.2% in the 13 week period, sales of Monster were up 10.5%, Sales of Reign were up 43.7%, sales of NOS increased 11.2% and sales a Full Throttle increased 14.7%. Sale of Red Bull increased 10.2%. The company continues to have market leaders share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13 week and four week periods ended July 22, 2023. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 22, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including Energy Shots in dollars increased 13.7% over the same period, the previous year. Sales of the company energy brands which include Reign increased 13.8% in the four week period in the convenience and gas channel, sales of Monster increased by 11.1%over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 54.9%, NOS was up 13.2%, Full Throttle was up 23.2% sales of Red Bull were up 8.8%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 22, 2023, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increase from 36% to 36.1%. Monster share decreased from 30.4% a year ago to 29.8%, Reign sharing increased to 0.8 of share point to 3.1%, NOS\u2019s share remain at 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Red Bull\u2019s share decreased 1.6 points from 36.3% a year ago to 34.7%, VPX Bang\u2019s share decreased 4.2 points to 1.8%. Five Hour share was lower by 0.7 point at 3.5%. Rockstar share was down 0.2 over point to 3.4%, Celsius\u2019 share is 6.6%, C Four\u2019s share is 3% and Ghosts share is 2.8%. Please note that VPX Bank was in bankruptcy during this period, and we will address our acquisition of Bang later in this call. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 22 2023, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel decreased 3% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew was 3.3% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy was 7% lower, Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the four weeks ended July 22, 2023 was 54.1%, up 3.3 points, while Starbucks Energy's share was 45.6% down two points. According to Nielsen in all major channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023, the energy drink category increased 14.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 21.6% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 42.4%, up 2.4 points, Monster sales increased 25.6% and its market sharing increased 3.3 points to 38.1% NOS\u2019s sales decreased to 5.8% and its market share decreased 0.3 over point to 1.3%. Full Throttle sales decreased 43.2% and its market share decrease 0.3 over point to 0.3%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 23.7% for the month of June 2023. Monster sales increased 25.3%. Monster\u2019s market sharing value increased 0.4 points to 28.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 75.3% and its market sharing increased 1.7 points to 5.6%. The Nielsen's statistics from Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXA convenience chain, which dominates the market sales in the OXA convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2023 compared to June 2022, Monster\u2019s retail market sharing value increased in Argentina from 50.5% to 55.5%, in Chile from 38.1% to 40.8%. And in Brazil from 41.6% to 44.4%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide. Because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen in a 13 week period until June 18, 2023. Monster\u2019s retail market sharing value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16.2% to 16.6% in Belgium, from 32.7% 33.1% in France, from 29.8% to 31.1%, in Great Britain, from 31.8% to 35.2% in Norway, from 28.1% to 30.3% in the Republic of Ireland, from 39.4% to 41.6% in Spain, and from 15.6% to 15.9% in Sweden.

According to IRI in Australia, Monster\u2019s market sharing value for the four weeks ending July 9, 2023, increased from 14.1% to 16.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market sharing value decreased from 10.4% to 10.3%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster\u2019s market sharing value for the four weeks ended July 9, 2023 increased from 12.6% to 14.9% compared to the same period of the previous year. Live Plus\u2019s market sharing value decreased from 6.5% to 5.6%, and Mother's market sharing value remained at 5.3%. According to INTAGE in Japan in the month ending June 2023 Monster\u2019s market sharing value in the convenience store channel, as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 56.7% to 55.1%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending June 2023, Monster\u2019s market sharing value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year decreased from 59.9% to 57.6%. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these periods. Net sales to customers outside the US was $715.4 million, 38.6% of total net sales in the 2023 second quarter compared to $649 million, or 39.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in the US and US dollars by approximately $38.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales, our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the US and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 second quarter, increased 13% in dollars, and increased 16.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 34% compared to 26.7% in the same quarter in 2022. We are pleased that in the 2023 second quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2023 second quarter increased 17.8% in dollars and increased 26.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.4% versus 40.4% over the same period in 2022. Net sales in Japan in the 2023 second quarter increased 11.9% in dollars and increased 21.2% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 50.3% in dollars and increased 59.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales in the second quarter increased 3.7% in dollars and increased 10.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In the 2022 second quarter, our distribution partners restocked inventories following the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 26% in dollars and 36.4% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2023 second quarter increased 0.1 of a percent in dollars, and increased 9.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. In Brazil, net sales in the 2023 second quarter increased by 2.5% in dollars, and 3.6% in local currency. Net sales in Mexico increased 23.3% in dollars, and 10.1% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. Net sales in Chile decreased 23.8% in dollars, and decreased 26.6% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. The decrease in sales in Chile were due in part to a normalization of bottler inventory levels. Net sales in Argentina decreased 19.5% in dollars, but increased 54% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. which will be referred to as VPX, the former maker of Bang Energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorneys fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang Energy. VPX has appealed the judgment. We also previously discussed the false advertising case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, in which the jury returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages. And the District Court granted MEC\u2019s motion for a permanent injunction in joining VPX and former CEO Jack Owoc from falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang any other beverages contained creatine or form of creatine, VPX and Jack Owoc appealed the injunction. The bodies have completed briefing on remaining post round issues On October 10, 2022 VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries, and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On June 28, 2023, VPX and certain affiliates entered into an asset purchase agreement with the company, which among other things provided for the company's acquisition of substantially all of the VPX's assets. The transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement closed on July 31, 2023, at which time the company was deemed to have allowed general unsecured claims in VPX's bankruptcy case relating to the arbitration award, and the jury's award, subject to the potential modification of the Jury Award in the light of pending post-verdict motions filed by MEC and VPX. The asset purchase agreement also includes a mutual release between VPX and MEC which among other things, requires VPX to dismiss its appeals of the trademark infringement arbitration and the false advertising case, as well as cases that VPX filed against MEC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This mutual release does not include any claims the company might have against Mr. Owoc in relation to their jury award. The company will not recognize the allowed general unsecured claims or the jury award as it relates to Mr. Owoc [inaudible] realized or realizable. We will not be answering questions on these legal proceedings on today's call. In June 2023, the company also entered into an agreement with Orange Bank Inc. regarding the company's use and registration of certain bank trademarks and trade names subject to the successful closure of the asset purchase agreement. Under this agreement, the company will pay Orange Bank Inc. a onetime payment of approximately $12.5 million and a 2.5% royalty on all future sales of products bearing the trade name Bang. On June 31, 2023, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. Sorry, apologize on July 31 2023, we completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, collectively Bang Energy for a purchase price of approximately $362 million, subject to adjustments. The acquired assets include Bang Energy beverages, and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. We successfully recruited a limited number of former VPX employees to fill certain open positions within Monster, as well as the majority of the team at the manufacturing site in Phoenix. Pursuant to Monster's obligations with the Coca Cola Company, Bang Energy will be distributed through the Coca Cola bottlers network, starting with the United States in the 2023 third quarter. As a result, there will be a temporary disruption of the product supply of Bang Energy brand energy drinks. Additionally, our intention is to rationalize Bang\u2019s product offerings and product lines and to fully integrate Bang into the Monster infrastructure. We do not intend to manufacture or sell Bang\u2019s other product lines such as Red Line or Shots beyond liquidating existing inventories at this time, we may consider reintroducing certain of those product lines sometime in the future. We are excited about our acquisition of the state of the art Bang Energy production facility in Phoenix, Arizona, which we intend to utilize for Bang as well as other products in the Monster portfolio. As we only completed the acquisition this week, it is still early days and we will provide you with further updates on Bang Energy on our next Investor Call in November. In the first half of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed which is now available in 28 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. According to Nielsen scan data, The Beast Unleashed is currently one of the top new brands in the beer category in 2023. We plan to launch a hot iced tea extension of The Beast Unleashed named Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024. The brand will have full flavors Original, Half & Half, Razzleberry and Green. Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea will be available in 24 oz. single-serve cans as well as in a variety 12-pack in 12 ounce sleek cans. We refreshed the dials and doubled dials beer brands in the first half of 2023 and introduced Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. The brand family has performed well since the refresh. The high Lybrand family the largest in our beer portfolio, from scarcity is also performing well despite overall headwinds in the craft segment and is showing growth in retail scans. Our Alcohol Beverage innovation pipeline is robust, and we look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future. In the 2023 second quarter in the United States, we focused on gaining distribution on our first quarter product innovation. Following the success of our recent Monster Energy Zero- Sugar launch, we are planning to launch NOS Zero-Sugar in 16 ounce cans in the 2023 fourth quarter. In the 2023 second quarter, we expanded our Java Monster portfolio in Canada with the launch of Java Monster 300 Triple Shot, Mocha and Vanilla. We launched several new products in Latin America in the 2023 second quarter. In Argentina, we introduced our Monster Reserve brand, with the launch of Reserve White Pineapple in June. In the Caribbean, we continue to expand our portfolio and introduced a number of new products in different countries. After we successfully launched Java Monster Super Coffee, Mean Bean and Loca Mocha in Australia earlier this year, we expanded the launch of such products to the New Zealand market in the 2023 second quarter. We are pleased with early results in both markets. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 202,3 we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple, Ultra Gold, Ultra Fiesta Mango, Ultra Paradise, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Used Ozzy Lemonade and Used Chaotic in a number of countries. During the 2023 second quarter, we also launched additional SK use or BPM, Burn, Nalu, Predator and Reign in certain countries. We launched the Monster Energy brand in Egypt in June 2023. To add to Predator which we launched earlier this year in Egypt. In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar Energy drink to an additional eight EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 35 markets to date. During the second quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan and Monster Ultra Sunrise in Korea and Monster Reserve Pineapple in Turkey. We launched Predator in additional regions in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023. In July 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Japan and Predator in Iraq. Monster Energy will be launched in the Philippines later this year. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, July 2023 sales were approximately 13.7% higher than the comparable July 2022 sales and 12% higher than July \u201822 excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate July 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment to be approximately 12.1% higher than in July 2022 and 11.2% higher than in July 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. July 2023 had the same number of selling days as July 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. First, the energy category continues to grow globally. Second, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Third, our IFF labor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land of costs to our EMEA region. Fourth, we are enthusiastic for 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Rainstorm and Tour Water in United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA. Fifth, we are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, we are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Sixth, we are excited about the launch of Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with the goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024 as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are pleased with the initial results of our launch Rainstorm, our new line of Total Wellness Energy drinks. Eight, we are pleased with the rollout of Prince and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally, we are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number -- additional number of international markets. Nine, we are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Grom at UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator and good afternoon, guys. Hope you're doing well. So I wanted to pick up on the gross margin commentary and just get a sense for how the quarter kind of came in versus your expectations. This is the first time we haven't really seen the sequential improvement on gross margin in about a year. And I know you mentioned promotion, I think you've talked about other costs, back at the shareholder meeting. But can you maybe just talk about how you see the drivers of gross margin evolving through the balance of the year, should we still expect to see sequential progression from here? And then maybe bigger picture, can you help frame where we are on the long term margin recovery journey. Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : Peter, the difficult answers your question is that we really don't give guidance. So if we look at this quarter that we just reporting, we spoke about some of the drivers behind the improvement in gross margin. But against that, we did have continued increases, and I've said this in previous quarters in certain ingredients and other input costs, as well as co-packing. So that's the fact that will stay with us. And then we have another obviously, issue that we spoke about, and that is geographical sales mix. So as we sell more product overseas, so the margin reduces overall, the percentage gross margin reduces overall. And then, as you look at the alcohol business building, the gross margins from that side of the business are less than the gross margins that we enjoy in the energy drink sector. So you've got pluses and minuses, the alcohol brands, you'll see in the Q that will be released in a day or so that the alcohol brands were $60 million of sales, and that margin is lower, and we've reported it as being lower than in the rest of the business. So, overall, there's really is a mix, and then with a Bang product coming in, we expect that the Bang product will have the same margins as the kind of Ultra products in our own portfolio, the Reign products and Ultra products, and that will improve margins. So overall, there's a -- we've got a mix of positive items that are benefiting gross margins and those items that are detracting from gross margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, and good afternoon. Can you comment on where you're seeing the energy category demand perspective, from a consumer standpoint? And then related to that, obviously, congrats on the acquisition of Bang. How are you planning to lean even more into this wellness energy category, with the organic growth through the House Renovation, Rainstorm, in particular continues to grow fast, but now Bang adds more presence into that sub segment. So what are you \u2013 what you can share at this point, I know you're going to share more in the next earnings call. But can you talk about how you can participate even more in that category? And if I can squeeze just a clarification about Brazil and Latin America, I think x, Mexico continues to do well. But I was surprised to see a deceleration. I know, it's tough comparison, when you gain a lot of shares in Brazil, but just to make sure that we get those points in. Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : So if I talk about the energy category as such, and we started looking at the one week data because the community looks at the one week data, and the energy category is still growing in good double digits 13% in the last week, so we're seeing a good increase in the energy category. And as we look at, traditional energy and wellness energy and performance energy, obviously, you've seen kind of differences within those segments. Interesting, the Bang started off life as a very much performance energy. And today, if you look at the brand, and you analyze what it stands for, really stands for a different segment, which is really lost on energy. So you've got all these different brands that are filling different needs within the energy space. But traditionally, energy is still growing, I did a quick analysis and the traditional energy is still growing and the number I'm looking at is around 10%. You've got this other wellness energy and obviously we are participating in that segment with Rainstorm, yes, which we are really excited about. And then performance energy where we have Reign which is doing very well. The difficulty in, really going deep in -- deep dive into performance energy is that the Bang brand has suffered, because it's lost so much distribution. And that's a factor that obviously is driving that segment of the market. And then quickly, just turning to Brazil, and Chile, the energy category in those countries really grew very rapidly. And we grew extensively within those two countries, but there has been, we've seen a little bit of a slowdown in growth in both Brazil and in Chile. And as you can see, from the numbers that we reported, we are still market leaders. So it's something that is part of doing business within Brazil and in Chile, and we maintaining a market share. And we had a product issue in Chile, which have now been sorted, we bring in product from Mexico, we now are able to produce locally in Chile. But the market has taken somewhat of slowing growth. And, we've been as a market leader, we've been part of that as well. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Two clarifications on the Bang acquisition. So first, can you provide us with like, the last 12 months sales for the brand? And then bigger picture like how are you guys planning to position the brand in the US? What consumers are you going after? And then internationally, you mentioned the transition to the coke system in the US, you plan that also to transition international? And if you can give us any timeline on that. Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg : Maybe I just comment a little bit just, pretty much Hilton, I think covered most of in his last answer. But we are able to look at the brands if you've seen what how the Bank brand has, in fact developed. It was originally in the black can focused, sort of focus on competing with Monster and it then went to a color can and then more recently it went to a white can. And then that white cat has gone through a transition as well. So you then got Reign which is in a black can, and you've got Rainstorm, which is in a 12 ounce white can. And so we see a different way of separating the brands, marketing them differently, and positioning and we think they can all basically fit within our broader portfolio completely separate to NOS which is very much a Motors sort of brand Full Throttle and Monster. So if you look at that packaging, that's how we do it, we're going to probably change the packaging slightly of the Bang brand, but it will remain principally a white can and in a 16 ounce. And so we feel that there is a way which we do -- all these brands can play quite with each other within our portfolio. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if I can just to follow back up on Peter Grom\u2019s question and understanding you don\u2019t give guidance around gross margin. I guess as we looked at it on a gross profit per case basis. You were actually kind of flattish sequentially. So ignoring the percentage but looking at the dollars, is that at all a better way to think about the go forward as just as you're managing gross profit per case on dollar basis relative to the margin. Thanks very much. Hilton Schlosberg : So we always look at gross profit per case. When we launch a product that's very much part of the way that this company has always examined new product introductions. So know your costs that phrase has been something that we preached for any number of years. So as we go forward with new products with new innovation, even for example, with a Bang acquisition, knowing the cost is vital to really being able to position a product within our portfolio. Now, obviously, some products have lower gross profits per case, like, for example, the coffee products, but they are an important part of our portfolio. So as we examine products, and we examine where we are, we always have to look at what we are delivering to consumers to meet to their needs, within the overall ambit of a product portfolio. Now, when we went into energy, into alcohol, I'm sorry, we went into alcohol with our eyes wide open, we knew the margins that were in alcohol would be lower than the margins in the energy drink category. So we look at margin, I've always said this on calls, I say we bank dollars, we don't bank percentages. And I've always encouraged analysts to just think, likewise, that we don't bank percentages, we bank dollars. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hey, good afternoon. How you doing? So just one quick follow up there. And then just kind of like a capital allocation question. But would you mind providing the Latin America gross margin on the quarter? I probably missed it or I'm not sure you gave it. But that would be helpful, and just a Latin America in general. So is there a temporary disruption that we're working through? Or is what we're seeing underlying demand? So just those two follow ups? And then I realized this is a multi-part question, I'm probably going to get in trouble. But just from a capital allocation standpoint, when can you start buying back stock again, so thanks so much. Hilton Schlosberg : So let's talk a little bit about Latin America, remember, we sell to the distributors, and the distributors sell to the retailers. And as the demand is somewhat reduced at retail, the distributors cut back their inventory. So they over inventorize, they cut back. And, unfortunately, we are the recipient of what happens in the distribution channel. So as I said, all of these issues will resolve themselves, because you have these cutbacks, but then we go to a more orderly situation, where we should go to more lean situation in future quarters. And that's where we are in Latin America. The brand is so as I said, very strong. We market leaders in Argentina, we market leaders in Brazil, we market leaders in Chile as very big markets and market leaders in other countries as well. So that's an answer to that. And then, what I would ask you to do is, listen to the conference call, because I don't want to repeat numbers that we've already said, we're already running out of time, the Q will be out in in two days, and that should answer your questions on Latin America. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Hi, guys. I just wanted to quickly circle back on gross margins and see if you could share what impacted out of orbit issue that you highlighted during your shareholder meeting, maybe head off margin and whether this issue is now resolved, essentially. And I just want to confirm that you guys are now back working within your orbit. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes, Bonnie, there always will be anomalies. And we're in the middle of summer, as you know, and it's been pretty hot out there. And we're doing our very best to stay within orbits, but there are anomalies from time to time and our mission in this company has always been to satisfy our customers. So yes, there will be, we maintaining within our orbits, but there are times when we will and we do stray from that. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks very much. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca Cola Bottler system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will remain safe and healthy and have enjoyable summer. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.",

The acquired assets primarily include Bang Energy Drinks and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value, which we define as the Bang Inventory Step-Up hereafter in the call. As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter. During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the company recorded a gain of $45.4 million, which will be referred to hereinafter as the Bang Transaction Gain, in interest and other income and expense net within the condensed consolidated statement of income. During the 2023 third quarter, the company incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition expenses related to the Bang Transaction and those are referred to also later in this call as the Bang Transaction Expenses. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.86 billion in the 2023 third quarter, 14.3% higher than net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter was 53%, compared with 51.3% in the comparative 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 53.4% for the 2023 third quarter, excluding the Bang Inventory Step-Up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter as compared to the 2022 third quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs. Promotional allowances for the 2023 third quarter were higher than in the comparable 2022 third quarter, as well as the 2023 second quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $473.2 million, compared with $415.8 million in the 2022 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were 25.5%, compared with 25.6% in the 2022 third quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter included approximately $8 million of Bang Transaction-related expenses. Distribution expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $85.7 million or 4.6% of net sales, compared to $83 million or 5.1% of net sales in the 2022 third quarter. Operating income for the 2023 third quarter increased to 22.2% to $510.5 million from $417.9 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. Interest and other income expense net for the 2023 third quarter increased to $71.4 million from $2.1 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The increase was due to $39.3 million of interest income and a gain of $45.4 million related to the Bang Transaction. Such amounts were partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses of $13.2 million. The effective tax rate for the 2023 third quarter was 22.2%, compared with 23.3% in the 2022 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense. Net income increased 40.4% to $452.7 million, as compared to the $322.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 third quarter increased 41.3% to $0.43 from $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang Transaction Gain, the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the Bang Transaction Expenses net of tax was $0.41 for the 2023 third quarter, an increase of 34.1%. The company plans to implement additional price increases in certain international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2023, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.2% versus the same period a year ago.

The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and four-week periods ended October 21, 2023. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 6.7% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company\u2019s energy brands, excluding Bang, increased 4.5% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 1.9% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 35.2%, NOS was up 9.7% and Full Throttle was up 7.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 1.8%.

Monster share decreased from 31.1% a year ago to 29.7%. Reign share increased 0.6 of a share point to 3%, NOS share increased share increased 0.1% of a share point to 2.6% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7 of a percent. Bang share was 1.4%.

Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 2% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy was 14.9% lower.

NOS sales decreased half a point and its market share decreased by 0.1 of a point to 1.2%, sorry, the sales decreased 5 point -- 0.5%.

Sales of Predator increased 60.3% and its market share increased 1.5 share points to 6.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXA convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXA convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2023 compared to September 2022, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 52.8% to 56.8%, in Brazil from 43% to 45.1% and decreased in Chile from 41.7% to 39.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. I would like to point out, the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until October 8, 2023, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 30.5% to 31.3% in France, from 29.9% to 32.4% in Great Britain, from 5.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, from 31.6% to 34.7% in Norway and from 40.3% to 40.5% in Spain.

According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of August 2023, Predators retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 29.8% to 32.8% in Kenya and from 17% to 20.3% in Nigeria. According to IRI in Australia, Monster\u2019s market sharing value for the four weeks ending October 15, 2023, increased from 14.8% to 16.4% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother\u2019s market sharing value decreased from 11.7% to 10.1%. Going to IRI in New Zealand, Monster\u2019s market sharing value for the four weeks ended October 22, 2023, decreased from 13.6% to 13.3% compared to the same period the previous year, Live Plus\u2019 market sharing value decreased from 6.2% to 5.2% and Mother\u2019s market sharing value increased from 6.1% to 6.4%. According to INTAGE in Japan, in the month ending September 2023, Monster\u2019s market sharing value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year increased from 55% to 58.9%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending September 2023, Monster\u2019s market sharing in value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year, decreased from 61.4% to 51.9% due to overly aggressive price promotions by a competitor. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $733.7 million or 39.5% of total net sales in the 2023 third quarter, compared to $610.6 million or 37.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $29.2 million in the 2023 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales, our ourselves to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 third quarter increased 22.3% in dollars and increased 23.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 31.1%, compared to 34.7% in the same quarter in 2022. We are also pleased that in the 2023 third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the 2023 third quarter increased 16.8% in dollars and increased 21.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2022.

Net sales in Japan in the 2023 third quarter increased 22.5% in dollars and increased 29% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 18.7% in both dollars and local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.2% in dollars and increased 28.3% in 28.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam, net sales increased 13.3% in dollars and increased 18.7% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2023 third quarter increased 25.2% in dollars and increased 38.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37.7% for the 2023 third quarter versus 34.7% in the 2022 third quarter. In Brazil, net sales in the 2023 third quarter decreased by 4.3% in dollars and decreased by 9.6% in local currency, due in part to inconsistent purchasing patterns by our bottlers. Net sales in Mexico increased 54.4% in dollars and increased to 30.1% in local currency in the 2023 third quarter. Net sales in Chile increased 60.2% in dollars and increased 44.3% in local currency in the 2023 third quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 61% in dollars and increased 243.4% in local currency in the 2023 third quarter. We continued with the launch of the Beast Unleashed during the quarter, which is now available in 43 states, through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the initial results of the Beast Unleashed and are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being available in substantially all of the United States by the end of 2023. We plan to launch Nasty Beast Hard Tea in the first quarter of 2024 with the goal of being national -- of national distribution in the first half of next year. Nasty Beast Hard Tea will be available in four flavors and will be sold in 24-ounce single-serve cans, as well as in a variety 12-pack of 12-ounce sleek cans. In the United States, we launched Bang Energy in 12 single SKUs and two multi-pack SKUs through our Coca-Cola bottlers in the month of September. In the 2023 third quarter, we also shipped NOS Zero-Sugar 16-ounce cans to support our planned 2023 fourth quarter launch. In Mexico, during July 2023, we launched our third Predator SKU with Predator Purple Rain and expanded our Monster Zero-Sugar offering with the launch of Monster Ultra Watermelon in August 2023. In El Salvador and Honduras, during the month of September, we launched Reserve White Pineapple. And in Puerto Rico, we launched Monster Ozzy Style Lemonade in July 2023, and in September, we introduced our Reign Storm total wellness energy drinks. In Australia, Monster Ultra Peachy Keen was launched in July 2023. In September, we launched Mother Reignbow Sherbet in Australia and Mother Lava Guava in New Zealand. In EMEA, in the third quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach, Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple, Juiced Aussie Lemonade, Juiced Chaotic, Ultra Gold and Ultra Peachy Keen in a number of countries. We are excited about the launch of Monster Zero-Sugar in Great Britain in the 2023 third quarter. We will expand distribution to Poland and the Republic of Ireland in the 2023 fourth quarter and to an additional 28 markets by the end of the first quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Japan and launched Predator in Iraq. In October 2023, we launched Monster Ozzy Lemonade in Japan. In India, we participate not only in the premium energy drink segment with Monster but also in the more affordable segment with Predator. We recently introduced Predator in a 250 ml PET format in a limited region in India to complement our existing product offering is 300 ml cans. We also transitioned the Monster brand in the Philippines from our independent distributor to our Coca-Cola Philippines bottler. During the 2023 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 7.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.83 per share for a total amount of $400 million, excluding broker commissions. As of November 2, approximately $282.8 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that on a foreign currency-adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, October 2023 sales were approximately 25.8% higher than in the comparable October 2022 sales and 25% higher than October 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. We estimate that October 2023 sales including the alcohol brands segment to be approximately 24.8% higher than in October 2022 and 24% higher than in October 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. October 2023 had one more selling day compared to October 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules, this affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land of costs to our EMEA region. We are continuing with our plans to add a Juice facility to our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We are pleased with our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Rainstorm in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We are excited for the launch of Nasty Beast Hard Tea early next year with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024, as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. I\u2019d like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, Operator. Good afternoon, guys. Hope you are doing well. So maybe one housekeeping question\u2026 Rodney Sacks : Good afternoon. Peter Grom : \u2026 and then one real question here. I guess, on just the Bang Transaction, I apologize if I missed this, but did you mention how much of a contribution the transaction was to sales in the quarter? And then, I guess, just my real question here is, I would love to get some more color on the quarter-to-date trends you just mentioned. I think it was 25% or so, much better than what we can see in the track data. So can you maybe unpack the drivers of that? Is that simply just much stronger growth in international markets or is there any sort of sales pull-forward or timing impacts that we need to take into consideration? Just any color there I think would be really helpful. Thanks. Rodney Sacks : Okay. Firstly, with regard to the Bang Transaction and the Bang sales numbers, we do not separately give those numbers. They are all included within the Monster Energy Drinks segment. We launched Bang Energy in September through the Coke bottling system and it was not an immediate launch on September 1, some bottlers took a little bit earlier in August and many that rolled out in September, rolled out through the month of September. So this is not a real fair quarter for the capability of what Bang can bring to the portfolio. And then, on your second point, it was very difficult to hear you, Peter. I think you are referring to the October sales, were you not? Peter Grom : Yeah. I was just trying to understand, I think you mentioned 25% or so, it\u2019s just a lot different or stronger than what we can see in track data even after backing out kind of the Bang drag. So I just was trying to get some color in terms of what were the drivers of that, is it simply stronger growth outside the U.S. or is it -- is there any sort of timing contributions or pull-forward in sales, just any color you can provide I think would be really helpful. Rodney Sacks : Well, I think, it\u2019s important to understand that we have large unmeasured channels. And when one looks at Nielsen or IRI numbers, one doesn\u2019t really appreciate that the company operates through -- customers that do not participate in Nielsen or are not measured by Nielsen. And in addition a number of chain stores that allow pickup of products or ordering online, those numbers are not included within the all major channels that we see on the Nielsen. They included in the stores data, but they are not included in the all measured channels. Why? I really cannot answer that question. So there are a number of factors. The business was strong. We had a good October and those are the numbers. So, I really cannot comment anymore. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Drew Levine : Hey. Good afternoon. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking our question. So just wanted to circle back on the Bang acquisition and the transition to the Coke bottling system. Just any high level thoughts on improving distribution and sort of timeline to regaining shelf space for the brand would be helpful. And then, secondarily, within the Nielsen and IRI channels, it does appear that, sequentially, some of these more sort of emerging brands aren\u2019t really gaining as much market share sequentially. So just any high level thoughts on the category dynamics if you think those emerging brands might be hitting on a sort of ceiling and Monster\u2019s position within there, that would be helpful? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Yeah. So, remember, that number of both convenience and chain and other large stores discontinued the Bang brand during a period where there was a litigation and also with the products were questionable as regards to labeling. So there was a lot of discontinuation of Bang throughout the system. What we are doing and what our Coke bottlers are doing is regaining the distribution that is out there for Bang and also we are as a company making presentations to the large and smaller retailers, both convenience, grocery, mass, and obviously, the club channel to ensure that Bang is restocked in their sets. So that will take a little bit of time, it doesn\u2019t happen overnight and we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve really very much extended distribution in the new sets as they come out. And then on your second question regarding the smaller brands, already we have a mission that\u2019s focused on our brands and our brand families, and I really don\u2019t want to comment on the competition. Other than to say that we have a very comprehensive portfolio here and we believe that we are in a good position to focus and build upon our own sales, while recognizing the achievements of the competitors and the positioning of the competitors. Operator : The next question is from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Vivien Azer : Hi. Good evening. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on your commentary, just now in terms of the conversations that you are having with retailers, recognizing that it might be a little bit early days in terms of driving for extended shelf reset and increased placement on Bang, but operationally, kind of how are you thinking about that? Is it kind of a one-for-one for every market share point of improvement you think you can drive for Bang that\u2019s incremental square footage? Are you willing to sacrifice some linear square footage on tertiary, SKUs within your own portfolio to revitalize that brand, any incremental color would be helpful? Thank you. Rodney Sacks : Yeah. We have set our sales team an objective and that is they are not compromise any of our existing shelf space to incorporate the Bang brand. The Bang brand has emerged as a lifestyle brand and we believe it should be positioned in a -- hopefully in a separate cooler away from the energy beverages that includes the wellness beverages and the performance beverages and that\u2019s the mission that we are focusing on with our sales teams. Operator : The next question is from Charlie Higgs with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Charlie Higgs : Hey, Hilton and Rodney. I hope you are both well fine. I got a question on China, please, and the good 28% growth you posted there. Just wondering if you could give any color on that number. It\u2019s a lot stronger than competitors seem to be posting in China. And then, just how the portfolio shaping up there, and then, you -- have you launched Predator there? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : Perhaps, I will just take that. The brand, we have sort of looked at realigning the brand and focusing on the main SKUs and we are gaining additional sales and traction with the brands. So the brands, particularly, Green and Ultra, are doing very well in China and continuing to grow and getting solid sales per SKU -- per point of distribution. With regard to Predator, we are proceeding with our plans to launch Predator and that will happen towards the middle of next year, probably, the second quarter as presently planned. So that will go ahead in a PET bottle. So we are also pretty hopeful that we will have two offerings at different price points to attack the Chinese market. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Rodney Sacks : Hi. Mark Astrachan : Just one follow-up on one other question. So if you look at the scanner data, we look at total distribution points for Bang, I show it\u2019s up something like 22% at current levels or kind of a week or two ago relative to where it was even in September. So you had mentioned helping that, I think, the rollout in September was a bit more measured. So I suppose why shouldn\u2019t we get a little more excited about what you can do from shelf space in terms of where it was? I guess it\u2019s never going to be what it was a few years ago, but certainly seems like it\u2019s on a good starting level there. And then, the main question, we are getting lots of questions and I am sure you are about how to think about pricing and what Red Bull is going to do in the market. I guess, how long does it take for you to figure out how much pricing Red Bull is going to pass-through and how quickly or when you have to tell the retail establishments that you are planning on following them if you decide to do that? Thanks. Rodney Sacks : Well, generally when you have a price increase in our industry, it takes 60 days to 90 days to get pricing adjusted in the U.S. market. I think where we are is, we are evaluating the competition, and obviously, we are reevaluating Red Bull and their pricing and we will see where it goes. They took -- because of promotions they took a lot less in 2022 than was originally expected. So I think we just watching for what happens with demand and the elasticity of demand and we are in a really difficult consumer environment, not necessarily for energy drinks as you have heard on this call. But I think we have to be very wary and watch and see and we will evaluate what makes sense for us and time we will make a decision. I mean we have always said that if there is an opportunity to take price, we will, but we are also very cognizant of the fact that, we don\u2019t want to lose a bunch of market share in the process. And then, Mark, you referred earlier to Bang, and yes, the Coke bottlers during the month of September got Bang back in as many shelves as they were authorized to get product back. And yes, of course, there was an increase in September, but -- and October, and we will continue seeing the development of Bang as we get more and more shelf space authorized to -- for the brand. But as always, we don\u2019t give guidance on these calls and but I will just say that, we are all optimistic here about the future and the potential of the brand otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have done the acquisition. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good afternoon. Rodney Sacks : Hi. Just was wondering if you could give a sense of strategically how you think about the portfolio. In the US, you have got the share headwinds are greater for the Monster brand versus some others. Maybe just how do you think about resource allocation or trying to push to protect and strengthen that brand, what kind of margin mix implications are there or is it just anything under the total corporate umbrella is -- if it it\u2019s got momentum is great. Just give us good a little sense of how you think about the portfolio, strategy and how much -- how important it is for Monster to take the lead or not? Rodney Sacks : I think Monster has always been our lead brand and will continue to be the lead brand. So, ultimately, we focus on Monster itself. And then, we look at the broader portfolio, we look at the category. The category has got grown in the last couple of years and it\u2019s much, much broader than it was and so we think that Monster\u2019s positioning should stay as it is, it\u2019s got -- its positioning, it\u2019s got its authenticity and credibility for what it stands for and it can\u2019t be everything to all consumers. And that\u2019s why these other brands play a really important role for the company and enable us to actually attack other parts of the category, other consumers who have different values and have different need states, whether it\u2019s from NOS to Reign. You saw the results of Reign have increased and sales have really been very healthy. So that brand is doing very well with its positioning, which is different to the positioning we have got for Rainstorm. And then, the same thing that, as Hilton mentioned earlier, we have sort of -- we have taken the positioning of -- for Bang as sort of more of a lifestyle brand. Again, it has its own positioning. The cans, as you know, in the last few years has changed from being a black can, more performance orientated to be a white can, more lifestyle orientated. So there are different positionings, different price points, we think that we will get incremental space for these other brands in joining coolers or additional coolers space, where you are having the -- where you are finding more space being allocated to the clean energy or natural or sort of healthier perception energy brands. As you -- also look at sizes, Rainstorm is in a 12-ounce cans versus our traditional Reign brand in a 60-ounce black can. So these are ways that we are able to distinguish these different products and find a place for each of them on the shelf and to attract different consumers. And so, if you look at the whole portfolio, we think it actually fits together quite nicely and we see growth coming from all of these different levels, but still 100% our main brand remains and our focus is obviously Monster, which is the driver for the company and will continue to be so. Hilton Schlosberg : Rodney, I think, one other point for Michael is that, if -- Mike, you need to look at the numbers, because, I think, Red Bull is suffering far worse than Monster and the -- I think that\u2019s something you need to look at. That\u2019s number one. And number two, a number of our analysts are -- and we have noticed this as of late, are taking the Bang numbers and putting the Bang numbers into Monster, both this year and last year. And obviously, that\u2019s not a great exercise, because Bang has -- Bang share and Bang sales have fallen off dramatically over the last year, particularly through all this litigation and with the removal from shelves and the discontinuations as I mentioned earlier. So that\u2019s not a good exercise to put the Bang brand into Monster this year and last year. So what we did on this call, we actually separated Bang separately and the rest of the portfolio so one could get a feel of the performance of the Monster portfolio separately from what\u2019s happening with Bang. Hopefully, sometime down the line we will be able to roll the two into one another and then it will make better sense of growth or otherwise. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. On behalf of the company, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead. Rodney Sacks : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Before I turn the call over to Rodney Sacks, I would like to mention a clerical error that we had with the filing of our most recent press release that was filed just within the last half hour. And under the income statement session, under the 3 months ended December 31, 2023 the amount that was reported as gross profit which was reported as $983,372,000 should have been $938,372,000. Aside from that clerical error all other numbers on the press release are correct. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter was 54.2% compared to 51.8% in the comparative 2022 fourth quarter. As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $5 million during the 2023 fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.5% for the 2023 fourth quarter, excluding the Bang Inventory Step-Up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter as compared to the 2022 fourth quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs. During this call, we will talk about impairment charges of approximately $39.9 million recorded in the 2023 fourth quarter related to the Alcohol Brands segment due in part to the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories. We will refer to these charges as the alcohol impairment charges. The alcohol impairment charges related to certain non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment acquired as part of the CANarchy transaction. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $504.4 million compared to $390 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter included the alcohol impairment charges. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 29.2% compared with 25.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter. Exclusive of the alcohol impairment charges as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 26.8%. Distribution expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $79.6 million or 4.6% of net sales compared to $76.1 million or 5% of net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10% to $434 million from $394.4 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. Operational income adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the alcohol impairment charges increased 21.4% to $478.9 million for the 2023 fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was 18.5% compared with 23.3% in the 2022 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. Net income increased 21.6% to $367 million as compared to $301.7 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Net income adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, increased 33.1% to $401.5 million for the 2023 fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 22.3% to $0.35 from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, was $0.38 for the 2023 fourth quarter, an increase of 33.8%. The company has implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and 4-week periods ended February 17, 2024. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 5.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, were up 0.9% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster declined 0.7%. Sales of Reign were up 21.6%. Sales of NOS increased 5.1%. And sales of Full Throttle increased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.9%.

Including Bang, the company's market share is 37%. Monster share decreased from 30.8% a year ago to 29.1%. Reign's share increased 0.3 of a share points to 3%.

Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 4.6% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 16.9% lower. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2024, was 58.2%, up 3.5 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 41.5%, down 3.3 points.

Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 8.6% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands decreased 0.2 of a point to 41.3%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 10.9% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 10.5%. Monster's market share in value decreased 0.1 of a point to 29.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 23.2%, and its market share increased 0.6 of a share point to 5.6%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.9% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 33.6%. Monster's market share in value increased 4.7 points to 45.8% compared to January 2023. In Argentina, due in part to hyperinflation, the energy drink category increased 167.2% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 178.2%. Monster's market share in value increased 2.2 points to 55.8% compared to January 2023. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 1.8% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales decreased 2.2%. Monster's market share in value decreased 1.7 points to 40.5%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January 2024, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.9% to 16.3% in Belgium; from 31% to 31.6% in France; from 30.8% to 33.2% in Great Britain; from 4.9% to 6.2% in the Netherlands; from 32.7% to 34.4% in Norway; and from 40.5% to 40.9% in Spain.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $637 million, 36.8% of total net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter compared to $542.5 million or 35.9% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022.

In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10.4% in dollars, and increased 11.1% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 32.7% compared to 33.9% in the same quarter in 2022 and 31.1% in the 2023 third quarter.

During the first quarter of 2024, we announced that CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective, or what we referred to as CANarchy, will operate under the name Monster Brewing Company. This change will better align the business with our brand equity. We continue with the expanded distribution of The Beast Unleashed during the fourth quarter of 2023, which are now available in 48 states through a network of beer distributors. We have commenced with the rollout of The Beast Unleashed in 24-ounce single-serve cans in the convenience and gas channel. We are pleased with the results of The Beast Unleashed and are continuing to expand points of distribution of this brand. Nasty Beast Hard Tea was launched in January of 2024, and is now available in 40 states with a goal of national distribution by midyear. Nasty Beast Hard Tea is available in 4 flavors and is available in 24-ounce single-serve cans as well as a variety 12-pack of 12-ounce sleek cans. Early response to the brand has been very positive. In the U.S., during the 2023 fourth quarter, we expanded NOS Original with a zero sugar offering, NOS Zero Sugar. Our pipeline innovation continues in the first quarter of 2024. In January, we launched 2 additional flavors of Reign Storm, Guava Strawberry and Citrus Zest to add to the 4 flavors already in distribution. We are planning to launch 2 additional Reign Storm flavors, Apricot Strawberry and Mango in March 2024, bringing the total number of Reign Storm flavors to 8. In February, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red in 16-ounce and 12-ounce sleek cans. We also launched Monster Rehab Green Tea, Reign Total Body Fuel Sour Gummy Worm, Monster Juice Rio Punch, Java Monster Irish Cream and Monster Reserve Peaches and Cream. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we continue to innovate in our multipack and variety pack offerings. In Canada, during the first quarter of 2024, we launched several new innovations. In January, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams in 2 package sizes as well as Reign Total Body Fuel Cherry Limeade and Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle. In early February 2024, we launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar in a 710 ml receivable package as well as Monster Rehab Wild Berry Tea. In Latin America, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched several new innovations. In Brazil, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch. In Uruguay, we launched Monster Ultra Sunrise. And in Chile, we launched Monster Aussie Style Lemonade. In Colombia and Guatemala, we launched Monster Reserve White Pineapple. In Peru, we launched Fury Gold Strike, an affordable energy brand. In Latin America, during the first quarter of 2024, several new flavors have been introduced. In Mexico, we continued to expand our affordable portfolio and introduced Predator Tropical. In the 2023 fourth quarter in New Zealand, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Peachy Keen. In Australia, during the first quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Monster Juice Papillon. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Juice Monarch, Nitro Cosmic Peach, Reserve Orange Dreamsicle and Ultra Peachy Keen in a number of countries. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched in Great Britain, Ireland and Poland in the second half of 2023, with additional launches planned throughout EMEA in 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Aussie Lemonade in Japan, Monster Ultra Paradise in Malaysia, Monster Mango Loco and Pipeline Punch in Kazakhstan and Monster Mango Loco in the Philippines. In February 2024, we introduced Predator Gold Strike in Azerbaijan and in the Philippines. During the 2023 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 0.8 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.57 per share, for a total amount of $43.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of February 27, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for purchase under the previously authorized repurchase program, that is dollars. We estimate on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brands segment, January 2024 sales were approximately 20.5% higher than the comparable period January 2023 sales, and 19.7% higher than January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. We estimate January 2024 sales, including the Alcohol Brands segment to be approximately 17.8% higher than in January 2023 and 17% higher than in January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. January 2024 had one more selling day compared to January 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be in future to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally. Two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. The Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We're excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. And lastly, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the 2023 year. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator and good afternoon everyone. Hope you're doing well. So I wanted to ask a question specifically on gross margin. Clearly, the quarter came in a bit better relative to some of the commentary from the investor meeting. Maybe first, did something surprise you in the quarter? And then second, just going back to that same commentary from the investor meeting, there seem to be a lot of optimism that the gross margin trajectory would improve nicely from 4Q looking out to '24. I know you don't give guidance specifically, but just any thoughts on how we should think about the margin trajectory given the very strong exit rate? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So I think at the Investor Meeting, as I recall, we already spoke about 2023 Q4. As you know, we don't give guidance, and we really do try not to give guidance. So if I could just talk about Q4 for a minute, Q4 was strong. But there were a number of really nonrecurring items included in GP in Q4, mainly related to true-ups of various promotional items, various true-ups with partners as well as -- we have a few, we don't have very many, but we have a number of rebate programs. So looking at Q4 of 2023, I would say to you that on an ongoing basis, Q4 came up very much in line with what we expected, which was an increase over Q3. And it's at the level probably of about 53.5% on a kind of standalone basis excluding these nonrecurring items. Operator : The next question is from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask you about the energy drink category in the U.S. We've seen a bit of a slowdown in January. How much do you think it was the weather? How much would you think we're some other external factor on the consumer? And then maybe you can comment a bit on market share trends in the U.S. We've seen a little bit of pressure on the core Monster brand. So any color you could give would be helpful. Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. Firstly, I don't think one should discount the fact that the weather was a factor. Secondly, we do have a lot of non-measured channels. And if you heard earlier in the call, January sales were -- in my book, were really impressive, the increase in January sales. Added to that, Nielsen doesn't cover everything, as we've discussed before, and there were some interesting things in January, for example, one of the big club store chains had what we call an MVM, which is a club store chain that is not read by Nielsen, and in itself is pretty substantial. Adding to that, if you go back to January 2023, we had very robust increases mainly because of the launch of 2 brands that really hit it out of the park. One was Monster Zero Sugar and the other was Ultra Strawberry Dreams. On the call, you would have heard that innovation for 2024 has really kicked off in February and is going through February through to March, so we didn't have the benefit of that innovation program earlier on as we did in 2023. So these are all factors that one must take into account when one examines so-called slowness in the Nielsen volumes. Also, I might add that we have a number of important resets coming up, the trade reset from January on through the early part of the second quarter. So -- and we're anticipating big gains in shelf space not only for our legacy brands, not only for the SKUs that we are about to launch, but also for the Bang brand, where a number of retailers that had hitherto really discontinued Bang because of all the litigation and all of the issues are now taking it back, and we'll see that benefit starting really in the second quarter and -- sorry, starting in the first quarter and moving into the second quarter. So there's a whole number of factors that I think are worth bearing in mind when one looks at the Nielsens, for example, in January. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator. Just you said that you continue to look at opportunities for pricing in the U.S. What is preventing you to announce pricing at this point? Do you see -- I mean, obviously, the key competitor announced pricing back when we all saw you here in New York, you were talking about potentially looking at the impact of elasticities. It seems that things have been moderately positive. Is there any reason why you'd wait? And then second, Hilton, when you spoke about a normalized gross profit margin of 53.5%. Should we expect margins to continue to build from here given that potentially the high 50s, it's still below where you were before the pandemic at 60. Is there any reason why these new plans would not leverage as fast or any structural reasons that you would be below the high 50s? Hilton Schlosberg : No, the only structural reason is we don't give guidance. So that's the only structural reason I can think of. Obviously, we're working on margins. I'm proud to say that the Midwest premium and aluminum, which is one of [indiscernible] are coming down. But against that, we've said that we have increases in other commodities and other pricing. So we're bringing up our own manufacturing facilities up and we're doing whatever we can to improve gross profit percentages. But we don't give guidance and I don't know what's going to happen with freight, for example. We had a good benefit from freight-in this quarter -- this last quarter, and I'm not sure what's going to happen as we look forward into 2024 and the implications of the election and everything else. So that's about that. And then on pricing, we're taking pricing in a number of markets internationally. We've taken pricing in January in a number of markets. And we're moving through with an aggressive price increase program internationally. As regards to the U.S., we really are just -- we're waiting and evaluating. We run a very sizable business here. We have a number of customers that we deal with. And we want to make the right decision. So we're not saying no to a price increase, and we're not saying yes to a price increase this time. What we are saying is that we are honestly really evaluating and constantly evaluating the retail pricing environment. And if we believe there are opportunities, we will take them. Operator : The next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So the comments on some of the U.S. performance were helpful. Just given the strength of that global January number, can you spend some time discussing what you're seeing internationally in terms of category growth and your market share progression? And any thoughts on maybe key expansion plans internationally in terms of some of your key brands and how we should think about that for 2024? Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg : So, Dara, on the call, we did talk about progress internationally in very great detail. I think sometimes we give far more detail than we should, but we do. We gave market shares in various countries we indicated the new product innovations that are going to happen through -- throughout our international territories, and I'm not sure what other question -- what part of your question, we possibly have an answer. And I don't mean to be disrespectful. I just feel that a lot of your question has been covered. Rodney, I don't know if you've got anything to add. Rodney Sacks : No. Other than the -- there's -- if you look at the international markets, they've sort of been a little bit all over the place in many ways. But generally, they've been good. There was a little bit of slowing in Asia Pacific. We are taking steps to see some growth. But obviously, we are very substantial in those markets and the actual markets have been a little flatter. But we've got great opportunity in some of the international markets that are developing. We look particularly to markets like China and India. We're at the beginning of a growth phase in India, particularly focusing on not only Monster, but also Predator there. So I think that it is mixed. Some of the markets have had some sort of ups and downs, but overall, we're in growth in most of the markets, and we still see that as very exciting. And you can see from the results in January, we are still seeing -- despite the Nielsen numbers, we are still seeing good growth in the U.S. as well. Operator : The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Two questions for me, if I could. The first one is just on G&A expenses in the quarter. They were up a lot relative to our expectations of almost 25% in the fourth quarter. Just anything to unpack there and anything anomalous in that number? Hilton Schlosberg : Yes, we spoke about -- Steve, sorry to interrupt, but let's just answer the first. So remember, we spoke about impairment charges of $40 million in this quarter relating to the Alcohol Brands. Steve Powers : Yes. Sorry, I'm excluding that. It's still up a lot, excluding the impairment charges. Hilton Schlosberg : We'll look at that, but it's not what I've been seeing. Steve Powers : Okay. The second question is, in January, you highlighted plans just to step up focus on in-market execution in the U.S., specifically commercialization around placing of the full portfolio and innovation. And just any update you can share on progress made and cooperation you're getting on the -- from the Coke system on that effort? Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. I think that's not a one-fix issue. That's something that's ongoing, and we are working with the Coke bottlers to improve execution. As I said earlier, we are rolling out a number of new products and the new sets are all taking place in this first quarter from February onwards and early into the second quarter. And I think you'll see that -- well, I hope you'll see from those numbers when we report them, that the positioning should be somewhat different to where we are today. Operator : The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Hey, afternoon guys. I wanted to go back to international because I feel like it's one of those things that doesn't get the credit that's due, right? You built nearly a $3 billion run rate business at this point. And I think from the outside, it's a little bit hard to get a sense of kind of what's going on there. So not necessarily to Dara's question, but maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of number of SKUs that you have on shelf, not obviously by country, but sort of broader strokes of the opportunity you have to still develop your portfolio within those markets? How much opportunity is there broadly to develop the energy category? And sort of related to that, margins have improved, but they're obviously still a lot lower than your domestic margins, both gross margin and EBIT margin in that international business. How do you think about improving that over time? Is that possible relative to current levels? And kind of how do you think about the progression of that? Hilton Schlosberg : We've always spoken about the fact that internationally, we compete very strongly against -- in the main Red Bull. And we really try and keep our pricing. We have a pricing strategy that's worked well for us, and that's really keeping within a particular percentage of Red Bull pricing. And the minute we stray from that, we find that our market shares really suffers. So we really have an interesting dynamic in that we have, obviously, relationships with The Coke partners. And we have a pricing structure that kind of has a ceiling, right? So it's -- while we are always on a mission to improve gross margins, and we do that on an ongoing basis, there are some areas where it is very difficult to get gross margin. And I've said this before, that I think it will be very difficult in the main to get gross margins internationally to the levels that we have enjoyed in the U.S. You can see what happened in EMEA. They nudged their margins up by 1% in the fourth quarter. And it's an ongoing battle to improve margins, bearing in mind the dynamics of what we are working against. Operator : This concludes -- I'm sorry, go ahead, sir. Rodney Sacks : Sorry, I just finish the other part of the question that Mark had raised just before we sign off. Just to talk about the international opportunity, I think what Mark is alluding to is correct. In many markets, the international markets have really followed the U.S. We have a far broader portfolio in the U.S. Innovation continues from year to year. But what -- the benefit that the international markets have is they see what we've introduced in the U.S. and the large number of additional SKUs and literally brand families we have in the U.S. And they're able to try and look to those and try and introduce selected SKUs, which gives them a very large runway. In some markets, the runway is focused on the Monster premium brands. And in some markets, the growth is coming from an affordable sector. And we have addressed that. So we have Monster in many markets, but we've also -- where we see that the premium sector has more of a limited percentage of the population that can really afford to have the buying power. We are growing, and that's where we're starting to grow brands like Predator in many international markets and that will help us continue to see growth and Predator also has a lot of depth. We were launching Predator in China this year. We've just launched Predator in India in cans. We are now just rolling out PET in India. We are trying to address some volume production issues because there's not a lot of availability, but that will sort itself out reasonably soon. And we see enormous opportunity once we get some availability for production in PET for PET in India. So there are a lot of opportunities, but they vary from market to market and continent to continent. As you know, we've just recently launch, for example, in Egypt, we launched both Monster and Predator. Predator's quickly made a name for itself as a growing brand. So we have these opportunities in different countries around the world. And so we're quite excited about seeing that. As I said, we did have some slowdown in some of the more developed countries in Asia. The category slowed, but I think that those -- we are taking steps to address and introduce more and different innovation in those markets and to grow them. So we do look forward to having a really attractive runway around the world for us. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy, and thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Rodney Sacks : Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 first quarter, 11.8% higher than net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 comparable period and 15.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, 12.6% exclusive of Argentina's impact. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter was 54.1%, compared with 52.8% in the comparative 2023 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower input costs, partially offset by geographical sales mix. Operating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $485.1 million compared with $412.8 million in the 2023 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were 25.5%, compared with 24.3% in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased storage and warehouse, increased marketing expenses, increased sponsorship and endorsement and social media expenses as well as increased payroll expenses. Distribution expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $94.4 million, or 5% of net sales compared to $76.3 million or 4.5% of net sales in the 2023 first quarter. Operating income for the 2024 first quarter increased 11.7% to $542 million from $485.1 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 first quarter was 23.5%, compared with 20.1% in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction in the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter. Net income increased 11.2% to $442 million as compared to $397.4 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 first quarter increased 12% to $0.42 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2023. The company implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets, including highly inflationary markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and 4-week periods ended April 20, 2024. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through April 20, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, were up 0.1% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster declined 1.4%, sales of Reign were up 16.1%, Sales of NOS increased 4.9% and sales of Full Throttle increased 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 3.6%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, decreased 2.1% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 3.3% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 5.3%, NOS was up 4.5% and Full Throttle was down 0.6%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2.1%. According to Nielsen,  for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased from 36.8% to 35.7% and excluding Bang. Including Bang, the company's market share is 37.3%. Monster share decreased from 30.6% a year ago to 29.3%. Reign's share increased 0.1 of a share point to 3.1%. NOS' share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Bang share was 1.6%. Red Bull share increased 0.4 of a share point to 34.6%. Market share of certain competitors were as follows : CELSIUS 8.5%, C4 3.7%, 5-Hour 3.3%; Rockstar 3% and GHOST 3%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line, in the convenience and gas channel decreased 10.7% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 3.6% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 19.5% lower. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, was 59.5%, up 4.4 points, while Starbucks Energy share was down 40.1% -- down to 40.1%, down 4.4 points. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2024, the energy drink category increased 10.2% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 2.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands decreased 2.8 points to 40.3%. Monster sales increased 4.2% and its market share decreased 2.1 points to 36.5%. NOS' sales decreased 6.9% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 1.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 22.2% and its market share remained at 0.5%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 23.1% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 20.2%. Monster's market share in value decreased 0.7 of a point to 29.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 28.6% and its market share increased 0.2 share points to 5.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined,  in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 15.7% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 26.7%. Monster's market share in value increased 4.2 points to 48.1% compared to March 2023. In Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation-related local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 265.9% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 300.2%. The Monster's market share in value increased 5 points to 58.5% compared to March 2023. In Chile, the energy drink category decreased 8.4% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales decreased 7.8%. Monster's market share in value increased 0.3 points to 42.9%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of March 2024, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.5% to 16.2% in Belgium; from 32.8% to 34.2% in France; from 30.8% to 33.1% in Great Britain; from 4.7% to 6.6% in the Netherlands; from 28.3% to 30.3% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 39.9% to 41.3% in Spain.

Monster's market share in value decreased 5.3 points to 51.4% against the comparable period the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $744.1 million, 39.2% of total net sales in the 2024 first quarter compared to $622.9 million or 36.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $64.4 million in the 2024 first quarter, of which $50.4 million related to Argentina. In EMEA, net sales for the 2024 first quarter increased 28.2% in dollars and increased 32% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2023. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter was 34% compared to 30.7% in the same quarter in 2023.

Additional launches are planned throughout EMEA in 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Violet in Japan, Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and Monster Pipeline Punch in China. During the quarter, we also introduced Predator Gold Strike in the Philippines and Azerbaijan. Last month, we launched a noncarbonated Predator Gold Strike in a 500 ml PET bottle in selected provinces in China. Initial acceptance from retailers and consumers has been positive. During the 2024 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.96 per share, for a total amount of $97.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. The company intends to commence a modified Dutch Auction tender offer for up to $3 billion in value of shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions at a specified price range that is yet to be determined. The company believes that the tender offer represents an efficient mechanism to permit shareholders the opportunity to obtain liquidity without the potential disruption that can result from market sales. The Company expects to fund the tender offer with approximately $2 billion of cash on hand and approximately $1 billion in combined borrowings, consisting of a new revolving credit facility and a new delayed draw term loan facility, each expected to be consummated prior to the completion of the tender offer. The tender offer will be made outside of the Company's previously authorized repurchase programs and will allow the Company to retain the ability to purchase additional shares through the previously authorized repurchase programs in the future. The Company's co-CEOs, namely Hilton and myself, have indicated that we intend to participate in the offer for investment diversification and estate planning purposes. My participation in particular, may provide me some flexibility to consider my own potential options, which may also help the Company continue succession planning for its next phase of leadership. In this regard, after consultation with the Company's Board, I am considering reducing my day-to-day management responsibilities starting in 2025, while continuing to manage certain areas of the Company's business for which I have always been responsible. At that time, I intend to remain Chairman of the company's Board and Mr. Schlosberg would segue from Co-CEO to CEO. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 12.9% higher than the comparable April 2023 sales and 14.9% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment. Excluding Argentina's impact, we estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 11.5% higher than the comparable April sales and 13.5% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate April 2024 sales, including the alcohol brands segment to be approximately 10% higher than in April 2023 and 11.9% higher than in April 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. April 2024, we had 2 more selling days compared to April 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a larger number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We're excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. Initial acceptance from retailers and consumers has been positive. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally, including the launch last month of Predator in a noncarbonated formula in 500 ml PET bottles in selected provinces in China. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 first quarter, 11.8% higher than net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 comparable period and 15.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, or 12.6% exclusive of our Argentina's impact. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Filippo Falorni : I just wanted to ask on the April number you just gave, I know 1 month of data is not indicative of your long-term results. But  just maybe clarify what's in there. Is the 2 extra day included in the number because that alone can get you to about 10 points of growth? And maybe any timing-related impacts that impacted the number compared to like what you just reported in Q4? That would be helpful. Unknown Executive : So the 2 extra days in April were obviously included in the numbers that we reported for April sales. The second part of your question, I actually didn't really understand. So maybe you can repeat it. Filippo Falorni : Sure. I was just curious, like, is there any impact in terms of shipment timing to the bottlers, considering the trend that we've seen in Q4, it seems a material deceleration. So wondering whether is there any timing impact in that number, in the April number? Unknown Executive : Yes. So we've always spoken in our business about the fact that we sell to the bottlers. And in some cases, the bottlers particularly internationally in manufactured products for us, which we purchase from the bottlers and then sell to them as part of the distribution arrangements. And oftentimes, they determine when they want to produce. So we expect them to produce on such and such a day and such and such a month, they may produce in a subsequent month or they may produce earlier. So when we talk about ourselves, remember, there are sales to the bottlers, they are not sales to -- we do some business at direct to customers, but most of our sales are done to the bottlers. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I was hoping if you can talk a bit about how we should be thinking of the consumer, in particular in the U.S.? We have been hearing a lot of your peers talk about a softening and how we should be thinking of in the context of pricing that you potentially alluded, some of your competitors have taken pricing. You decided to stay put at this point. Anything you can add and how it relates to aluminum going up on the spot price? Unknown Executive : This is a repeated question from you, and thanks for raising it again. As you know, we have a very strong brand. The brand is an affordable luxury. And it's strategic for us to orchestrate when and if we'll take price. So I think we've done a lot of evaluation on what makes sense and what makes sense to the brand, as we said we would. And in principle, we have really worked hard at really coming to a decision that a pricing opportunity is out there. And we -- I'm not saying how much it's going to be. It's going to be later this year, but we will be announcing to bottlers and retailers sometime in the next few months because there's -- as you know, there's a 30- to 60-day -- mainly 60 days for implementation of a price increase, but we expect it to happen in the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : Rodney and Hilton, I know no changes for some time, but congrats on kind of the new roles to come. I guess I just wanted to ask about the Dutch Auction announced today. Just kind of -- just would love some perspective on the decision process? Why now? Why using debt? Is this a change in terms of how you're thinking about the balance sheet in longer term? Or is this just kind of a short-term dynamic? And lastly, I'm not sure if I missed this, but did you provide any color on timing as it relates to this? Rodney Sacks : I think that it's a question of timing. I think that given the recent softness in the market, we believe that it is an opportunistic time to execute an at-scale transaction of this nature. We believe that this structure gives the company the opportunity to repurchase a greater number of shares and do so more quickly than we could under the programs, which we've implemented, as you know, over the -- quarter by quarter, we've continually strategically bought stock back. We think that is a good use of our cash. Obviously, we look at acquisitions from time to time, but we have a lot of excess cash. . And if you remember, we did a similar modified Dutch Auction in 2016 that we thought was very successful. It enabled the company to buy back shares, and we moved on. So we think the timing is right. We think that we'll probably implement it shortly in the next week or so. We'll come out with the documentation and the formal announcement. So it will be in this quarter. We also want to make the point that the tender offer is going to be in addition to our existing plans, which will remain in place. And that will also continue to give us opportunity to, again, to continue to buy additional shares as and when opportunistically, we think we should. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : Just a follow-up on the pricing announcement in Q4. Just is that on the entire U.S. portfolio? Is that the plan? And then just the question would be, I think this is the best international gross margin in several years. And so is there anything structurally occurring in your international margin structure? Or is this just maybe just easing commodities, easing import, cost easing. So basic question, is this just more cyclical in commodities? Or is there something else going on within your international gross margins? Unknown Executive : So referring to your first question. And you asked a question about gross margins and we -- and if you look at this quarter, we had a pickup, obviously, in international margins which we've been working on for some time, particularly in EMEA. And we also had a pickup in U.S. margins. So we've been working on improving margins across the board. You'll remember that I spoke in the first -- in the fourth quarter, when we had our final year results, and I said that our gross margin then had a few nonrecurring items in basically true-ups and rebate programs that were recognized in that fourth quarter. And I said that on an ongoing basis, on a stand-alone basis, we expected margins to be at the about the 53.5% level. Well, we did better than that. And it's something we've been working on and we'll continue to work on in trying to improve gross margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : Congratulations to you both, I guess, pending Rodney's decision. I had a question on your U.S. sales growth in the quarter, which was, I guess, a decent step down. It sounds like your business is maybe slowing month-to-month during the quarter and then a little bit in April. So could you touch on what's driving the slowdown and really for the entire category. I guess I'm also curious about this in light of your robust innovation pipeline and I think shelf-space gains. And then you mentioned that you continue to grow your sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. So first, could you just maybe clarify how your sales are performing on your end in the measured channels. And then could you give us a sense of what percentage of your business is now in nonmeasured channels, I guess, in the U.S.? Unknown Executive : So Bonnie, we don't report what percentage of our sales is done in the nonmeasured channels. So it's hard for me to give an answer to that since we don't report it, but it's something we can consider doing in the future. But our nonmeasured channels remain strong. And as you know, we have a bunch of really important customers in that category, including FSOP, Foodservice On-Premise. We have one of the big club store chains is in that nonmeasured channel. We have Home Depot, Lowe's, Amazon. So we do have a bunch of customers that operate in those nonmeasured channels. And you can see the discrepancy between the Nielsen numbers and what we report as a company because, a, the Nielsen numbers are sales to consumers, we report on sales to bottlers and our direct customers, and we also include sales to our nonmeasured channels. And then I just actually wanted to get back to a previous question where it was asked whether that price increase that we referred to would be across the whole portfolio. And when we look at the portfolio in the U.S. We have a number of different product lines. But the reference to the price increase will be on the main Monster Energy line, and possibly some of the others, but that also has not been clarified as of yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Kaumil Gajrawala : Can I try maybe following up on Bonnie's question a little bit more, at least from the data and stuff that we're seeing, it sounds like there is maybe more of a slowdown than perhaps what  you're seeing or how you're feeling about the category itself. And just if you could dig into, is that accurate? And if so, what do you think might be happening? Rodney Sacks : First talk a little bit -- there clearly has been a slight slowdown. I mean I think that you guys have followed a lot of the consumer product companies both beverage and non-beverage. And I think that there is -- including a lot of the convenience chains we report as well. And I think there has been a report generally across the board, there is some slowdown. I think you've got to take into account that last year, there was a lot of acceleration. There were increased sales, so you're looking at it on a 2-year basis as well. But there is some softness. We think that inflation and higher gas prices are having an effect on the number of consumers that are going into the stores and traveling. And so I think that is something I think we're sort of industry-wide are experiencing. We think that things will pick up. We think that summer is coming, but that has been something you've noticed and you guys see that. You read the Nielsen's as we do, but we also look to other channels to look at increased sales. And through the other channel business, we have continued to have healthy sales. And obviously, we are introducing a lot of innovation that's getting listings now. So we are looking positive to how that will implement our sales going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Can you just give us an update on Bang and just some of your thinking on how it's progressing and specifically maybe some of the marketing activation or distribution momentum and what we might expect for plans for the rest of the year? Unknown Executive : So if you look at Bang and look at the latest 4 weeks, you'll see that sales are starting to accelerate. And mainly because we've been able to get listings as we move through to this season of listings in the chains. As you know, the brand was discontinued for a number of reasons last year. And it's been a real impetus to get the brand up and running. We believe it has, and we believe it's moving positively. The marketing for the brand is -- has really been a low ebb and it's gaining momentum as we move into the summer. We're in the process of accelerating, and I'm going to be careful what I say, but a large influencer platform to help move and accelerate the brand. So the marketing is underway. It's just taking a little bit of time to get it up and moving. As I said earlier -- or I said in previous calls, it's positioned as a lifestyle brand. And we believe that too -- we have to invest in the market, we accept that and to achieve the positioning that we're looking for. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Maybe I just actually wanted to ask not on the gross margin line, but on some of the operating expense lines. I mean there's been quite a sizable build, I think, in some of those numbers and certainly ahead of, I think, what the Street had. I'm just curious, is there any timing shift there? Or is there any build in terms of the, I don't know, distribution expense ahead of either shelf resets or Bang rolling out more significantly? Just kind of want to understand how you're thinking about that going forward. Unknown Executive : Well, on the one hand, we took a conscious decision to build up inventories. So in doing so, we really had this objective of satisfying demand, which we really did not do very well at in previous years. So we have significant inventories now, and we -- our in-stock rates are climbing in the 95-plus percent levels. So we're able to service much better, but obviously, there's a cost to it. And freight, as you know, has gone up. And -- so that's one factor. Warehousing has gone up. So that's one factor in the -- in our operating expenses. There's nothing that's really that's tied to any particular period. These are all expenses that were incurred within the quarter and they reported as being in the quarter. Sponsorships are up, payroll is up. So there's a bunch of -- and you'll see it in -- more effectively in the Q, the number of cost items that are up. And as before, we do maintain a huge objective to get costs down. So these increases do not get unnoticed. But unfortunately, they're part of doing business in the world in which we're living, and we have competitors. And we have to negotiate for the best marketing dollars that we can. Rodney Sacks : The only thing I would add is that when you look at the costs, and we've had increases in sponsorship and marketing and social media, those probably are the biggest cost increases. But we are diverting or focusing a little more on the social media platforms because of the full array of our brands that are more aligned to social media consumers. Those are going to take effect and we have these programs being put in place, and we're obviously expensing those costs as we incur. But I think some of the benefits will start -- we're hoping we'll start seeing them in the second and third quarter as we go into summer, and those programs become more, more active. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask who's going to be reading all of the country market share numbers, Rodney, when you transition to the full Chairman role, just kidding. Unknown Executive : Need Rodney to do that. Mark Astrachan : Seriously, I wanted to ask about international gross margins. Just curious how you think about the ability to potentially improve those in negotiating specifically better economics with the Coke system is Monster's importance to the system and to their revenue and profitability increases. And I guess maybe thinking about it broadly, right, a lot of these agreements were struck 9 years ago. So 10-year anniversary next year. I know some are up for renewal then. What about on a go-forward basis? And sort of how do you think about those discussions with the system? Unknown Executive : Yes, Mark, thanks for that question. I want to put you in that position. It's dealing with the bottlers and you've got a lot of experience, I know in talking to them, but that's really a tough egg to crack. So we have to do it in different ways. We've got to look at commodities. We have to look at it in terms of pricing. And we've got to look at it in a very judicious manner with the bottling community. We have a great business going and we've got to be very careful not to jeopardize the motivation behind the brands. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : I guess just on the price increase, just the question I've gotten a few times. Is there anything you can share in terms of the magnitude of the U.S. fourth quarter price increase? Unknown Executive : Peter, it's really difficult because we've come to an assessment, and before we go out to our bottlers and our retailers, it would be -- it would not be appropriate for me to talk about that at this stage. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola Bottling System. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of the company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks, Tom. The energy drink category in the United States and in certain other countries experienced lower growth rates in the second quarter. Retailers have reported a reduction in convenience store foot traffic and we have seen a shift in retail towards more mass and dollar channels. Other beverage and consumer packaged product companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment and weaker demand in the quarter. The energy category globally continues to grow and has demonstrated resilience as we believe that consumers view energy drinks as an affordable luxury. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen measured channels. The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 second quarter or 2.5% higher than net sales of $1.85 billion in the comparable 2023 quarter, 6.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, 4.3% exclusive of Argentina's impact. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the alcohol brands segment increased 7.4% in the 2024, second quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 second quarter was 53.6% compared with 52.5% in the 2023, second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 second quarter as compared to the 2023 second quarter was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower aluminum can costs partially offset by production inefficiencies. On a sequential quarterly basis, gross margins were 0.5% below 2024 first quarter margins, primarily as a result of higher allowances certain of which we believe are nonrecurring as well as production inefficiencies. Operating expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $492.3 million, compared with $450.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. The increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses, increased payroll expenses and increased storage and warehouse expenses. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 second quarter were 25.9%, compared to 24.3% in the 2023 second quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $87.4 million or 4.6% of net sales compared to $82 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2023 second quarter. Operating income for the 2024 second quarter increased 0.6% to $527.2 million from $523.8 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 0.6%, 2024 second quarter was 22.9% compared to 23.2% in the 2023 second quarter. Net income increased 2.8% to $425.4 million as compared to $413.9 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 second quarter increased 5% to $0.41 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2023. As previously reported, we will be taking an approximately 5% price increase on our core brands and packages effective November 1, 2024, in the United States. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States for the 13-week period ended July 2, 2024. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 20, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang were down 2.5% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster declined 3%. Sales of Reign were down 0.5%. Sales of NOS increased 4.1% and and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.7%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2024, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased 2.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, decreased 4.8% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 5.4% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales decreased 3.8% and NOS was up 2.6% and Full Throttle was down 8.6%. Sales of Red Bull were up 0.7% or 0.8%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 2024, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased from 35.7% to 34.7%. Excluding Bang, including Bang, the company's market share is 36.7%. Monster share decreased from 29.4% a year ago to 28.5%. Reigns share rains decreased 0.1 of a share point to 3%, NOS share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6%, and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Bang's share was 1.9% and Red Bull share increased 1 share point to 35.9%. Market share of certain competitors were as follows : CELSIUS 7.9%, C4 3.5%, 5-hour 3.3%; Rockstar 3% and GHOST 3%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2024, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line, in the convenience and gas channel decreased 11.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew was 5.6% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 17.9% lower. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the 4 weeks ended July 20, 2024, was 57.4%, up 3.4 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 42.2%, down 3.5 points. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended July 30, 2024, the energy drink category increased 6.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 2.1% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands decreased 1.8 points to 40.2%. Monster sales decreased 1.2% and its market share decreased 2.8 points to 34.7%. NOS' sales increased 17.4% and its market share increased 0.1 point to 1.3%. Full Throttle sales increased 66.9% and its market share increased 0.2 or 2.5 of 8%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 20.3% for the month of June 2024. Monster sales increased 18.1%, Monster's market share in value decreased 0.5 point to 28.2% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 21.8% and and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 6%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively ourselves in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.1% and for the month of June 2024. Monster sales increased 29.1%, Monster's market share in value increased 3.7 points to 48.1% compared to June 2023, in Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation-related local currency price increases. The energy drink category increased 301.3% for the month of June 2024. Monster sales increased 320.2%. Monster's market share in value increased 2.6 points to 58.1% compared to June 2023. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 0.8% for the month of June 2024. Monster sales increased 1.4%, Monster's market share in value increased 0.2 point to 41.1%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.

In India, predated Gold Strike in a PET format which was launched as a test in 1 region at the end of 2023 is also meeting expectations. We are planning to launch that pack format in additional regions in India later this year. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India and are excited about the expansion of Predator in these 2 countries. On June 10, 2024, the company announced the final results of its modified Dutch auction tender offer, which expired on June 5, 2024. The company accepted for purchase approximately 56.6 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $53 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3 billion excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. In addition, during the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, the company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares over common stock at an average purchase price of $49.55 per share for a total consideration of approximately $107.7 million, excluding broker commissions. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the company repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $49.59 per share for total consideration of approximately $192.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of August 6, 2024, approximately 342.4 million shares remained available for purchase -- sorry, $342 million remained available for purchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that July 2024 sales were approximately 5.9% higher than the comparable July 2023 sales and 6.1% higher than July 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment July 2024 sales were approximately 9.4% higher than the comparable July sales and 9.6% higher than July 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment. July 2024 had 2 more selling days compared to July 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. As reported earlier, we are planning a price increase in the United States on our core brands and packages effective November 1, 2024. We continue to review opportunities for price increases internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland, which we anticipate will be completed later this year. We're excited for the launch of Monster Energy Ultra Vice Guava in October 2024. Monster Brewing continues to provide opportunities within the alcohol brand segment. We're excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand fits well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : The commentary on the U.S. category was helpful. Could you just put the recent slowdown you're seeing maybe in context versus other soft patches if you go back in history just in terms of drivers, magnitude, et cetera, just to give us some insight on how long you expect this to last? And also within that, maybe you can just touch on the promotional environment and how that might impact your plans to maybe cushion some of the pending U.S. price increase with promotion and how you guys think through that? Rodney Sacks : Sure. Dara, historically, we've seen declines in quarterly year-over-year volumes, really only during the financial crisis and COVID lockdowns in the U.S., and they particularly significantly impacted foot traffic. The current situation in the U.S. is actually relatively unprecedented. And we've not seen inflation rates, and we haven't seen inflation levels, I'm sorry, and interest rates for one heck of a long time. And we believe that those have contributed to the slowdown. If you look internationally and those markets traditionally have been -- have a longer history of energy drinks. We saw and have seen slowdowns in certain European countries over the periods. And in each case that we've seen them, the levels have, in fact, rebounded. So at the end of the day, when you look at the positive factors, we believe that energy drinks certainly are a need state, consumers want energy drinks and Household penetration is growing, all the things we spoke about really on this call. And what we like other consumer products companies, we see this decline primarily driven by a reduction in consumer spending and the lower foot traffic in the convenience channel. We've seen reports of foot traffic convenience channel being down by as much as 3% to 3.5%. And then a swing towards more grocery mass on -- online purchasing. So it's kind of a situation where we are a blue collar brand. And our consumers are more hard pressed than consumers in other categories. And that's why maybe we have seen a larger reduction than other competitive products in the space. But at the end of the day, some of those competitive products have had price increases, which we have not had yet and we will have later this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I was hoping if you can talk about the -- basically about the channels, you discuss the mass channels and discounts being 1 and how you've been able to shift for those consumers who are looking for basically more affordable energy. And you did a reference to to production challenges internationally. Is there a way to think about it and the impact and if it's temporary, how we should be thinking about those? Rodney Sacks : The production challenges, which were in Germany have largely been resolved now. It is a situation where there was a lack of capacity in a particular plant, we set up facilities in other manufacturing entities and then the plants in Germany that the distribution points in Germany we're unable to accept product because there were -- they had challenges getting product in because we have a very large market in Germany. So it was a mix of factors. By the end of the day, we're back and running and we don't anticipate a recurrence of that issue in Germany this quarter. Hilton Schlosberg : Just to give color on the German issue. You must appreciate that in the second quarter, they had the European soccer championships, and there was a lot of extra demand a lot of unusual things happen, and that's why we ended up with this challenge. Which we think was unusual, and it's not likely to occur again in the future, and we've taken steps to address it for -- in the future and have more visibility. Operator : Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Kaumil Gajrawala : Can you try to just kind of reconcile the idea of still taking a price increase with the slowdown in the category. The commentary on who your core consumer is, they're being a little bit more careful doesn't seem to align with the idea to take a price increase, later? Rodney Sacks : Yes. Kaumil, if you look at our pricing, where we are relative to other other beverages that we would regard as kind of comparative. Those are the beverages, they've dramatically expanded their price. We've passed the price index to Monster products. And -- we still see it as an opportunity. The extent is not that significant. We still will retain a very competitive price for consumers. . Both within the energy category and the ready-to-drink beverages as a whole. And we've discussed it with most of our major distributors and customers. And we've absorbed significant increases. As you know, we had one increase in the last 2 years. And our competitors in the ready-to-drink beverage space have had multiple. So we still see it as an opportunity. And we think it is something that we should pursue and move forward with. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. So I was hoping to get some just some thoughts on the quarter-to-date trends, just when backing out the benefits from selling days, it doesn't imply a ton of growth on an underlying basis, if at all. So can you maybe just talk about category trends in July maybe unpack it from a U.S. versus international perspective? And just going back to Dara's question, just any thoughts in terms of how you see growth kind of progressing from here through the balance of the quarter? Rodney Sacks : We look at Nielsen like the rest of the group. And you can really see Nielsen if -- you look at U.S. convenience and you look at all measured channels, that the situation is actually getting worse in July, and it's not getting better. So we've always spoken about our nonmeasured channels and our nonmeasured channels have continued to be a significant part of our activities and continue to grow. But looking at the Nielsen numbers, and I'm sure you've seen that, Peter, the July numbers are -- so it's not a dramatic, but it is a worsening trend. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I thought... Rodney Sacks : Bonnie, we haven't thought to come on this call, we've been waiting for you. Bonnie Herzog : Well, you didn't pick me early enough. I've been here waiting. So I did want to... Rodney Sacks : We don't see the picking unfortunately. Bonnie Herzog : Yes. Okay. Well, I did want to circle back, of course, slowdown that you guys did report in the quarter versus your expectations. I guess I am still trying to reconcile a few things. Could you maybe help us understand where bottler inventory levels are? I mean, is there any timing impact by chance, especially internationally that might have impacted Q2? And then second, maybe help us understand your innovation pipeline. I know you talked about a lot, but any shipment timing impact that you saw with the rollout of innovation, whether it was in Q1 or in Q2? And then how do we think about the second half? Do you possibly have more innovation rolling out in the back half versus what you did in the first half? Rodney Sacks : Well, let me talk about -- answer your first question, Rodney will talk about innovation. We haven't heard of any bottle inventories that are challenged or have changed significantly this card. We are in summer -- and we haven't heard anything. I know and I read, obviously, one of the competitors mentioned that they had bought the inventory issues -- but we have not seen that. The only thing we spoke about is this German issue for 1 million cases, which has been rectified. Hilton Schlosberg : But I think we always every quarter, we have choppy issues with bottlers because -- as we said earlier in the quarter, it depends on when they produce and sometimes they may be producing just before or at the end of the period. That does have some effect. But again, we've not really looked and gone into it because it's really -- it's just part of the way our business is done, and we just got to live with it. And so we haven't called it out specifically, but these things do continue to occur. Rodney Sacks : If we hear something significant. Obviously, we call it out, but we haven't [indiscernible]. Hilton Schlosberg : Now with regard to innovation, innovation has been fine. We've had 2 good products -- the fantasy Ruby Red has done very well, and we've got out a little later with the Rio funds. They've both done very well. If I look at the sales point of those 2 items are pretty strong they're ahead of sales per point of competitive new product launches like Red Bull, their sugar-free this year. In fact, the sales per point of those 2 new items that we launched are actually ahead of South per point of the very top Celsius sort of SKU. So I'll just give you some sort of perspective. One of the perhaps challenges this year was perhaps a little lower than others. If you look at our the distribution levels we achieved on the innovation, they're perhaps a little lower. They've been in the 60s -- but 60s and perhaps we think that in a perfect world, that should have been closer to 75% or 80%. So that's something we are addressing with our bodily partners and with the industry. And obviously, I think we could probably improve on that. But that is probably one of the issues that perhaps didn't deliver as much in dollars on the innovation as One of the reasons that the innovation was maybe a little lower. But ultimately, the innovation has done -- is still doing pretty well when I look at even the latest weekly figures. Also, we do have this planned innovation. We have really a large company focus on the launch of Ultra Vice Guava. We think it's a really exciting, it's a really -- it's a great package. It's a great flavor. But we are, in fact, galvanizing our own team and the partners -- and we're going to go out and have a -- we believe, a real good launch of this product towards the end of this year, in the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So we see that as being really positive -- and I think that give us something to execute against. We also got some good innovation coming in next year and -- but that will start shipping at the end of this year, part of it and some of it at the end of January. And we've got a good plan going through for spring of 2025. So we remain encouraged by our innovation. In fact, one of the other innovation items we launched was Zero Sugar in EMEA, which has done really nicely. We also launched Juice bad apple which we hadn't launched in the U.S., and that has been rolled out, and that is also getting some really good reception. So that is something that we'll be looking at to maybe expanding in other areas, but we went -- we tested it first in EMEA. So we do have some pipeline coming or newer products. So we are positive going forward that we'll be able to address consumer trends and look at the industry will be positive going forward. Rodney Sacks : And one other thing I just wanted to mention, Bonnie, was that if you look at 2023, remember, we launched Zero Sugar, which was the analog to Monster Green. And that was a very, very significant launch. So when you compare '24 to '23, Zero Sugar was really a major push as indeed with Strawberry Dreams, great flavors. So was really incredible with regard to launches. 2024 was great, but obviously not at the same level as '23. Hilton Schlosberg : We'll also just as a matter of interest, we've got some great innovation. We're looking to launch for Bang because that's been a new brand to our portfolio. We have our own sort of innovation launch for early next year. And we have another launch in conjunction with all means possible. And their social media response and presence on their channels and for the brand has been, we are seeing some really positive signs. So we are sort of quite positive about also being able to take Bang into start to sort of start to get that brand more focused with new innovation now, which we haven't had until now. We'll be consolidating and just getting relistings. Operator : And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Filippo Falorni : I wanted to ask about gross margins. You mentioned in the release that you were 50 basis points below the first quarter because of higher allowances that you think are nonrecurring and some production efficiencies. Should we think those go away starting in Q3? And then maybe you can talk about the commodity environment. It seems aluminum is still favorable year-over-year -- is it going to be still favorable in the balance of the year? Just any color on the commodity environment as well? Rodney Sacks : Let me talk a little bit about what you're referring to -- and yes, indeed, we do believe that these -- the high allowances and the production inefficiencies will take care of themselves. I'm not sure where the the production inefficiencies will take care of itself in the third quarter, but certainly, it will over time. The production inefficiencies relate to the 2 plants that we have up and running. We opened Norwalk for production in April, and we're gearing up production in NOC, which is one of the reasons for the production inefficiencies because we're gearing up that plant to full production. And then on the other hand, we have our facility in Phoenix that we acquired as part of the bank transaction, which is at present, only producing bank products. But we're gearing it up to produce Monster both the Ultra versions of Monster and Reign, which are the nonsugar varieties and then ultimately, the sugar varieties because they don't have -- they don't have sugar tanks. And we've had issues with water that we've been dealing with to ensure that we deliver the best Monster flavors possible. So that's where the production inefficiencies are coming from, and they will resolve themselves over time. The alliances absolutely will resolve themselves, we believe, in the -- this next quarter, they should be gone. So that's where we are on that. Now in the -- on the commodities environment, we hedge aluminum. So how we hedge aluminum is we use the ladder. So we purchased aluminum according to a prescribed formula and we have certain amounts at our discretionary reevaluate aluminum on a weekly basis. So -- and we take advantage, of course, of pricing when pricing falls but there are instances where we may have purchased aluminum at higher prices to ensure that our latter strategy is properly executed because there was a time in aluminum, as you know, was up -- and everyone is going to purchase aluminum and now it's back down -- so it's a -- they're plus and minuses. But I do believe that we're in good territory with aluminum and aluminum, we should be able to see reductions over time. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rodney Sacks for closing remarks. Rodney Sacks : Thanks. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottling system. We believe that we're well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of the company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

However, in all measured channels, excluding convenience, the energy drink category is growing at a faster rate. In the United States, the energy drink category in the convenience channel is beginning to show some improvement in October. Although, we do not normally refer to one-week Nielsen statistics and do not intend to do so on an ongoing basis, I think that it is noteworthy to mention that according to Nielsen, for the one-week ended October 26, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 3.7% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of the Company\u2019s energy brands including Bang were up 2.9% and sales of Monster were up 2.2%. A number of other consumer packaged goods companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment for certain income groups and weaker demand in the quarter. Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in September and October, 2024. However, we cannot determine the impact on our business. The alcohol segment operates a brewery in Brevard, North Carolina, which was closed for a week due to flooding from Hurricane Helene. This brewery is partially operational and is expected to be fully operational by mid November 2024. We believe that many consumers view energy drinks as an affordable luxury. Growth opportunities in household penetration and per capita consumption along with consumers growing need for energy are positive trends for the category. In EMEA, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for the recently reported 13-week periods for our tracked markets, which differ from country-to-country is growing at approximately 11.1% versus the same period last year on an FX neutral basis. In APAC, for our tracked markets, the energy drink category according to Nielsen and INTAGE for our tracked markets for the 13-week period ending September 2024 is growing at approximately 13.6% versus the same period last year also on an FX neutral basis. In LatAm, for our tracked markets, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for the recently reported 13-week periods, which differ from country-to-country is growing at approximately 21.1% versus the same period last year, again also on an FX neutral basis. Gross profit for the 2024 third quarter was adversely impacted by an increase in inventory reserves, due to excess inventory levels in the Alcohol Brands segment of $10.6 million, which I will refer to later in this call as the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves. Operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were adversely impacted by a $16.7 million provision and $1.2 million of Company incurred legal expenses in connection with an intellectual property claim brought by the descendants of Hubert Hansen in relation to the Company\u2019s use of the Hubert Hansen name prior to the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, which closed in 2015. And, I will also refer to this later this call as the intellectual property claim. Net of tax, these items adversely impacted net income for the 2024 third quarter by $21.5 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02 per share. Diluted earnings per share on a pro forma basis for the 2024 third quarter adjusted for these items was $0.40 per share. On July 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its debtor affiliates. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value, which I will refer to as the Bang Inventory Step-Up. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value. Gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter as a result. During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $45.4 million in interest and other income. During the 2023 third quarter, the Company incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition costs related to the Bang Transaction. Net of tax, these items positively impacted net income for the 2023 third quarter by $22.7 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02 per share. Diluted earnings per share on a pro forma basis for the 2023 third quarter adjusted for these items was $0.41 per share. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the Company for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for the items impacting profitability and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information. We believe that these non-GAAP items are useful to shareholders on this call in evaluating our ongoing operating and financial results. These non-GAAP items should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of U.S. GAAP financial measures. The Company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.88 billion in the 2024 third quarter or 1.3% higher than net sales of $1.86 billion in the comparable 2023 quarter, 4.7% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brand segment increased 5% in the 2024 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the 2024 third quarter was 53.2%, compared with 53% in the 2023 third quarter. Gross profit for the 2024 third quarter was adversely impacted by the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter, exclusive of the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves, was 53.7%. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was primarily the result of lower input costs, pricing actions in certain international markets, and the Bang Inventory Step-Up, partially offset by higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales, mainly to drive trial and awareness of the Bang Energy brand in the United States, as well as the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves. On a sequential quarterly basis, adjusted gross margins were higher than the 2024 second quarter gross margins. Operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $519.9 million compared to $473.2 million in the 2023 third quarter. The increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased payroll expenses, increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses, as well as the intellectual property claims. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were 27.6%, compared with 25.5% in the 2023 third quarter. Adjusted operating expenses after making the adjustments described earlier increased 8% to $502 million as compared to $464.8 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $82.7 million or 4.4% of net sales compared to $85.7 million or 4.6% of net sales in the 2023 third quarter. Operating income for the 2024 third quarter decreased 6% to $479.9 million from $510.5 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. Adjusted operating income after making the adjustments described earlier decreased 3.5% to $508.4 million as compared to $526.8 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 third quarter was 21.8%, compared with 22.2% in the 2023 third quarter. Net income decreased 18.1% to $370.9 million as compared to $452.7 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Adjusted net income after making the adjustments described earlier, decreased 8.8% to $392.4 million as compared to $430 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 third quarter decreased 11.7% to $0.38 from $0.43 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share after making the adjustments described earlier decreased 1.6% to $0.40 per share as compared to $0.41 per share in the 2023 comparable quarter. Our third quarter financial results were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 third quarter of $62.8 million. We estimate that diluted earnings per share were adversely impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. As previously reported, we have taken a 5% increase on our brands and packages, excluding Bang, Reign, and Reign Storm, effective November 1, 2024 in the United States. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in our international markets. The Company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States for the 13-week period ended October 26, 2024. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13-weeks through October 26, 2024, all outlets combined excluding convenience, sales in dollars in the energy category, including energy shops increased by 4.9% versus the same period a year ago. According to the Nielsen report for the 13-weeks through October 26, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 1.9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the Company\u2019s energy brands including Bang were down 0.6% in the 13 week period. Sales of Monster declined 1.8%. Sales of Reign were down 2.9%. Sales of NOS increased 2.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5%. According to Nielsen, for the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 1.5% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the Company\u2019s energy brands including Bang were flat in the latest four-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 1.6% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales decreased 4.4%, NOS was up 3.9%, and Full Throttle was down 4.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 5.6%.

Monster\u2019s share decreased from 29.7% a year ago to 28.7%. Reign share decreased 0.2 of a share point to 2.8%. NOS\u2019s share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Bang\u2019s share was 1.9%. Red Bull share increased 1.4 share points to 35.9. Market share of certain competitors were as follows : CELSIUS 7.7, C4 3.4, 5-Hour 3.1, Rockstar 2.8 and GHOST 3.1. According to Nielsen, for the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024, sales in dollars in the Coffee + Energy Drinks category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel, decreased 7.9% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 were 3% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 14.8% lower. Java Monster\u2019s share of the Coffee + Energy Drinks category in the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024 was 58.6%, up three points, while Starbucks Energy\u2019s share was 40.8%, down 3.3 points. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended October 5, 2024, the energy drink category increased 7.7% in dollars. Sales of the Company\u2019s energy drink brands increased 8.3% versus a year ago. The market share of the Company\u2019s energy drink brands increased 0.2 of a point to 40.7%. Monster sales increased 3.9% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35%. NOS\u2019s sales increased 16.2% and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 1.3%. Full Throttle sales decreased 3.5% and its market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 0.05%. According to Nielsen, for all our efforts combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 16.3% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 11.3%. Monster\u2019s market share in value decreased 1.3 points to 27.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 18.6% and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 6.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the Oaxaca convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the Oaxaca convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.9% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 28%. Monster\u2019s market share in value increased 3.1 points to 48.2%, compared to September 2023. In Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation related local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 202.5% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 182.5%. Monster\u2019s market share in value decreased 3.8 points to 53%, compared to September 2023. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 11.7% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 12.9%. Monster\u2019s market share in value increased 0.5 point to 40.3%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. I would like to point out the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 6, 2024, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 31% to 32.8% in Great Britain, from 5.6% to 7.9% in the Netherlands, and from 40.2% to 40.4% in Spain.

Monster\u2019s market share in value increased 1.2 points to 53.1% against the comparable period the previous year. We again put out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by promotions and other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $760.1 million 40.4% of total net sales in the 2024 third quarter, compared to $733.7 million or 39.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $62.8 million in the 2024 third quarter, of which $26.5 million related to Argentina. In EMEA, net sales in the 2024 third quarter increased 6.8% in dollars and increased 10.4% on a currency neutral basis over the same period in 2023. In EMEA, our sales were impacted by bottler retailer disruptions in certain key accounts in Western Europe, as well as supply disruptions in South Africa. These disruptions reduced dollar sales by an estimated 2.9% in EMEA in the quarter. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was 35.4% compared to 31.1% in the same quarter in 2023. We are pleased that in the 2024 third quarter Monster gained market share in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa and Spain. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2024 third quarter increased 4% in dollars and increased 8.8% on a currency neutral basis over the same period in 2023. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was 40.2% versus 43.2% in the same period in 2023. Net sales in Japan in the 2024 third quarter decreased 7.6% in dollars and increased 0.2% on a currency neutral basis. In South Korea, net sales in the 2024 third quarter decreased 8% in dollars and decreased 2.2% on a currency neutral basis as compared to the same quarter in 2023, largely due to the timing of production schedules this year. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales in the 2024 third quarter increased 15.4% in dollars and increased 15.8% on a currency neutral basis, as compared to the same quarter in 2023. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and are excited about the recent launch of Predator, which is being rolled out to additional markets in China later this year and during 2025. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 13.5% in dollars and increased 13.8% on a currency neutral basis. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2024 third quarter decreased 5% in dollars and increased 20.1% on a currency neutral basis over the same period in 2023, 4.1% exclusive of Argentina\u2019s impact.

Net sales in Chile decreased 4.4% in dollars and increased 8.8% on a currency neutral basis in the 2024 third quarter, due to challenging economic conditions in the country. Our market share in the quarter increased 40.8%. Net sales in Argentina decreased 56.5% in dollars and increased 48.5% on a currency neutral basis in the 2024 Q3. We remain the market share leader in Argentina and our market share in the quarter is 55.1%. Monster Brewing had a challenging third quarter. Net sales for the Alcohol Brand segment were $39.8 million in the 2024 third quarter, a decrease of approximately $2.5 million or 6% lower than the 2023 comparable quarter, mainly as a result of lower sales of craft beers. In addition, as mentioned earlier, due to excess inventories of certain Monster Brewing brands, it was necessary to increase inventory reserves in that segment by $10.6 million. In addition to the appointment of a new President of Monster Brewing announced last quarter, we have now restructured the Senior Management team in the alcohol division and are continuing to consolidate production facilities to maximize efficiencies. The Beast Unleashed was rebranded to The Beast. The brand is now available in all 50 states through a network of beer distributors. The Beast was launched in the State of Utah in July. We are currently launching our second variety pack of The Beast in 12 packs, which includes Mean Green and three new flavors Pink Poison, Gnarly Grape and Killer Sunrise. The Beast Variety Pack 2 is currently available in 48 states. The Jai Alai IPA brand, family\u2019s first major refresh since 2017 is now shipping to all available markets. Oskar Blues first non-alcoholic brew designated Dale\u2019s will be available next month in select markets. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Vice Guava in the United States in October 2024. Initial response from customers and consumers alike has been very positive on this innovation. In Latin America, during the Q3 of 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Mexico, Monster Ultra Paradise in Peru, Monster Zero Ultra and Juice Monster Mango Loco in the Dominican Republic and Juice Monster Pipeline Punch in Costa Rica. In Australia, during the third quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Violet. In EMEA in the third quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Reserve, Orange Dreamsicle, Juiced Aussie Lemonade, Juiced Bad Apple, Juiced Mango Loco, Ultra Black, Ultra Golden Pineapple, Ultra Peachy Keen, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, and Ultra White in a number of countries. Additional launches are planned across all brands throughout EMEA in 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we launched Papillon in a 500 ml aluminium bottle in Japan and Ultra Peachy Keen in Singapore. In China, we expanded the launch of Predator Gold Strike, which was launched in 11 provinces in China at the end of April in a non-carbonated 500 ml PET bottle. We launched in two additional provinces Guangxi and Fujian in September. We are planning to launch Predator in a number of additional provinces in 2025. In India, we extended the Predator Gold Strike carbonated 250 ml PET bottle beyond the Delhi region to the Northeast states in July and Madhya Pradesh in September. We will continue adding additional states in 2025. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India and are excited about the expansion of Predator in these two countries. During the 2024 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 11.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $47.32 per share for a total amount of $534.7 million. As of November 6, 2024, approximately $500 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that October 2024 sales were approximately 4.8% higher than the comparable October 2023 sales and 5% higher than October 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brand segment, October 2024 sales were approximately 5.8% higher than the comparable October sales and 6.1% higher than October 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. October 2024 had one more selling day compared to October 2023. On our third quarter conference call in November 2023, we reported that gross sales in the month of October 2023, including the alcohol segment, were approximately 24.8% higher than October 2022 gross sales, which presented a high hurdle rate for the company this year. October 2023 had one more selling day than October 2022. A portion of the increase in the October 2024 sales may be attributed to advanced purchases by our customers in anticipation of the price increase in November in the United States. However, such amounts cannot reasonably be determined. Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in September October 2024. Again, however, we cannot determine the impact on our business at this time. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, the energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers\u2019 need for energy, are positive factors for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. As reported earlier, we\u2019ve implemented a price increase in the United States on November 1, 2024. We continue to review opportunities for price increases internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. The juice plant at our AFF facility in Ireland has now been completed. After trials, we expect the juice plant to be in production in early 2025. We\u2019re excited for the launch of Monster Ultra Vice Guava. The Call of Duty unpacked gaming promotion, which kicked off last month, has received positive consumer response, with the publishers reporting that it\u2019s the biggest Call of Duty release in the franchise\u2019s history. We are currently exploring opportunities for our alcohol products in certain international jurisdictions. We are seeing some acceleration in the sales and market share of Bang Energy and remain excited for the future of this brand within our overall product portfolio. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney C. Sacks: Hi Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : I want to just go back to the expectation of the flow through from pricing and how much you had to deal back on that? And how is your view on the state of the energy drink category given what\u2019s happening in particular now with October understandably, but one extra selling day, it might be a little soft from what I think investors would expect. So, I would appreciate your views on both. Thank you. Thomas J. Kelly: Yes. So, Andrea, when we have a price increase, we have to see where that price increase settles. And once we see a price increase settle and determine in what direction it\u2019s heading, what the elasticity of demand is, we are then in a better position to determine what promotional activity, if any, needs to be set against the brands. So, it\u2019s a really difficult question to answer at this time. Rodney C. Sacks: I think Andrea had a couple of other questions. Do you want to quickly go through your other questions, Andrea? Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Hilton. Yes, I was just saying if there is any pull forward that you saw, so that it would inform some of that. I mean, I would say October would have been stronger if that\u2019s the case. Would you say there was any pull forward for the pricing? In other words, like the retailers would take in more inventory ahead of the pricing? Rodney C. Sacks: Okay. So, we sell to the distributors, right, the Coca Cola distributors. And we allow them a certain amount that they can buy in and we cut off the old pricing in the middle of October. So, I\u2019m not sure and we\u2019ve looked at it and we cannot determine with reasonable certainty what if any of that increase was attributable to buy ins. I suspect there could have been some, but we just can\u2019t determine that. And in the same vein, it\u2019s hard to determine what the impact of the hurricanes were Milton and Helene were on the business. We know that at retail it was impacted and we\u2019ve done some work to try and assess the extent to which our own business could have been impacted. But again, it\u2019s difficult to determine. What we can say is that, if you look at the territories that were impacted by the hurricanes, both of them, there\u2019s probably a 1% differential between Nielsen activity in those territories and the activity through the U.S. So, there definitely was an impact. But again, we can\u2019t determine the impact on our business. Andrea Teixeira : And then in terms of state of the union for the energy category as we stand right now, I\u2019ll be appreciative of knowing your view. Rodney C. Sacks: Well, if we look at foot traffic in convenience, convenience is 62% of the Nielsen category for energy drinks. And we look at foot traffic and we talk to our retailers we get some input from third party market research companies and refer to the one anecdotal week that we spoke about earlier on this call. I think we have and it\u2019s again a personal view, I think we\u2019ve reached the bottom and are very close to the bottom. And I think here in Monster anyway, we actually feel good about things coming back. I mean, we saw what happened today that there was a rate cut. The election is over, which probably will give consumers bigger better confidence whichever party got in. I think there was some concern about the election. Now it\u2019s over. We\u2019ve passed that. We\u2019ve got a rate cut today. And what we\u2019ve seen in our industry is that there hasn\u2019t been a change in consumer preferences and a change to different types of drinks. Our consumers have stayed with energy drinks and instead of, we believe instead of drinking three a week or four a week, they\u2019ve been drinking one or so less. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Thomas J. Kelly: Yes, I think it is quite noteworthy. If you look at we started the Nielsen for the period ended 26 October. If you look at the latest 13 week period, the category was up 1.9. You look at the latest 14 weeks, the whole category in general was up 3.2 and the latest week is 3.7. So that trend has been and that\u2019s why we refer to it. We think there is some recovery trend there, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see with how that pans out. Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. And then just getting back to October very quickly, we did mention on the call, we had a really high hurdle rates over last year. So, that\u2019s another factor to bear in mind when you look at the October increases, which I thought were actually quite good. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Can you just maybe touch on how you see inventory levels or how you saw inventory levels going into October? And really what I\u2019m getting at here is, is it just a comp or because you sound quite good on consumption trends, but maybe distributors were still a bit reticent to take on more inventory. And now that the consumption is coming through, perhaps do you feel there could be a resumption into the remainder of the quarter? Because I think basically what\u2019s getting contemplated right now is if you\u2019re kind of running flattish for the quarter, excluding the extra day or if this is just comp and the consumption trends should start to show through in your numbers as well. So any comment there would be maybe helpful. Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, happy to do that, Chris. The way our business works, we sell to the Coke distributors. They place orders and we execute those orders. So, they have sophisticated systems that take into account consumption. That\u2019s one of the factors, weather another factor and a whole bunch of other factors and they order product that we deliver. So, we also have a some we have a small direct business and we\u2019ve spoken about the non-measured channels, which is done directly by us. But generally, we execute orders according to customer requirements. So, some of our competitors have hiccups in inventory. We don\u2019t our business doesn\u2019t behave in that way. We supply orders according to what our customers order. Operator : Your next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask about just your comment about the improvement in the category in October. How much do you think innovation plays a role as well? You sounded excited about the Vice Guava. Just general thoughts of if you think innovation can also drive further acceleration into the U.S. category as you think into October and the balance of the year? Thank you. Rodney C. Sacks: Look, I think innovation does drive some consumption, but we\u2019ve had innovation. We had probably three or four new innovative products in the first half of the year. We only really started to get product on shelf on our latest innovation which is one SKU sort of towards the end of October. So yes, there has been some benefit from that if you take the one week numbers. But I think overall, I don\u2019t think it has that has had much impact. I think the overall impact that we\u2019re seeing across a number of our other SKUs is also been trending sort of upwards as well. We see the South point just moving in a better direction. So, again, a short period of time doesn\u2019t make a whole summer. But at the end of the day, we do start feeling because everybody\u2019s been seeing the slower traffic and the sort of this little bit of stagnation in the category. But we do see signs of it starting to re-emerge and consumers being able to go back into stores and not buying again. Thomas J. Kelly: Yes. I mean, we said earlier, we believe the overall macroeconomic conditions are improving and that\u2019s positive. And the foot traffic inconvenience, I think that\u2019s another factor. As I mentioned earlier, we get third party research. We talk to our customers and that\u2019s all positive. So, add that to this equation, and I think you\u2019ll maybe come out with the kind of answer that we\u2019re thinking about here as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hope all is well. Rodney C. Sacks: Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about gross margin in EMEA. I know it\u2019s sort of specific, but it\u2019s one of those questions that I think a lot of people are curious about and don\u2019t have a huge amount of color. The trends have really improved over the last couple of years, but you\u2019re still decently below 2022 levels or 2021 levels, I should say. I guess the question is without asking for guidance because I know you don\u2019t want to give it, what do we think about from here? I mean, is it reasonable to think that you can get back to 2021? And if you don\u2019t want to specifically answer that, what are the trends that have led to the improvement in that region from a gross margin standpoint? And how sustainable are they? Hilton H. Schlosberg: Well, we have taken price. And we\u2019ve taken price historically in a number of international markets and we continue to examine opportunities to do so. The cost of production and the cost of raw materials, there have been increases over time and significantly increases since COVID. We\u2019re doing our very best to manage and hedge aluminium exposure, which is obviously a big cost in this company. So, we use a ladder, which we may have spoken about on previous calls, but if we didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll talk about it now. We have a ladder strategy, where we execute hedges to assist in managing aluminium exposure, and we really do examine that on a weekly basis or semi twice a month. So, that\u2019s something that we look at. So, all in all, we have a business that is focused some in the U.S. you heard about the numbers overseas, which are growing and they have lower margins, although we spoke about the EMEA margins on this call that have moved up in the quarter, which is the trend we are looking to achieve. And then we have alcohol, which is currently is at a lower margin lower percentage margin than the rest of the business. So, we here are very focused on improving margin wherever we can and we will not stop in that pursuit. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re carrying on working on and it\u2019s a work in progress. Rodney C. Sacks: Just to mention, I think you referred to EMEA largely. If you look at the last four quarters, we\u2019ve been margins have continued to improve each quarter. Are you still about the whole company? I thought you talked about EMEA. Mark, what are you talking about? Mark? I\u2019ll just give Mark comes out really relative to EMEA. So, I\u2019ll just complete that to say that we do have the juice plant coming into production pretty much early next year. And together with the measures Hilton has indicated I think that we\u2019ll see we\u2019ve sort of got positive about the EMEA improving in margin going forward and whether it can get back to 2021, I\u2019m not sure. So sorry, one was a question about the overall margin and I just sort of focused on EMEA. That\u2019s good. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney C. Sacks: Hey Peter. Peter Grom : I guess, I just wanted to go back to the advanced purchases. I get it\u2019s a lot of moving pieces and the hurricane noise probably makes it harder. But I think back in 2018 when you did the November price increase, you were at that point at least able to estimate the impact from advanced purchases ahead of the price increases. I\u2019m just curious, is there a reason why this time may be different and you\u2019re not able to kind of estimate that? And then just on gross margin, obviously, you would love some perspective on the path from here. You kind of alluded to it here. But can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a commodity perspective and kind of how you see inflation evolving from this point? Thanks. Hilton H. Schlosberg: Okay. Where we want to start. You want to start about commodities or advanced purchases? Peter Grom : Whatever you want. Hilton H. Schlosberg: Okay. All right. We have the option. So, I think the difference this time versus the previous price increase was that we cut off our price increase the favorable price increase mid-October. So with any customer who purchased product after mid-October, they actually paid the higher price. So, as we look at the whole structure, everything that happened in October, it\u2019s really it became a very difficult exercise to determine what, if any of the price increase could have impacted October sales. So, that\u2019s the bottom line. If we could have done a better exercise, we would have, but it became too secured as to try and find a sensible answer. So, we\u2019d rather not give it and we\u2019ll see the impact on the quarter when the quarter is over. And then in commodities, I think everybody knows that what\u2019s happening with aluminium. And I mentioned the extent that we have a ladder approach and we build up that ladder as time goes by. There\u2019s already a tariff on aluminium and we\u2019re hoping that the tariff will not increase, but there is already a tariff on aluminium. And as regards some of our other commodities, we have seen increases in some and we\u2019ve seen decreases in other. We buy a lot of commodities and it\u2019s really it\u2019s going to take us five minutes to go through them all. But what I can say is that generally we are seeing increases and in certain commodities like for example, aluminium, like for example, sugar and there are other commodities that have stayed the same or minimally decreasing. So, the climate that we\u2019re looking at for commodities is one of taking aluminium out of the picture, which is showing significant increases, is one of relatively manageable factors in increases.
