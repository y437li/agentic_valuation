Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We welcome you to our first Synchrony Financial earnings conference call. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners, our customers, our employees, GE and our new investors for making possible the launch of Synchrony Financial as a public company. For those of you listening in and who are not familiar with Synchrony Financial, I wanted to briefly touch on who we are and what makes our business model compelling. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation.  First, we are the largest provider of private label credit cards in the U.S. and a leader in financing for major consumer purchases and Healthcare Services. In aggregate, we have over $58 billion in receivables and nearly 60 million active account holders. Our range of credit products are offered to consumers, through our long-standing and diverse partnerships. That include national and regional retailers, manufacturers, buying groups and healthcare service providers. It's important to note that while we are a new public company, our consumer finance heritage dates back over 80 years. That's an important from an experience standpoint, but also demonstrates our commitment to our partners. We will support them through all business cycles. We provide a compelling value proposition to both our partners and consumers. Our loyalty and retail credit product suite is integrated with our partners to allow consumers to apply for credit, manage their accounts and access most customer services, seamlessly over their channel of choice, in store, online or mobile. We help our partners grow their businesses, with targeted marketing and loyalty programs. We have advanced data analytics and a CRM platform that enables us to transform big assets into actionable, retail insight, delivering targeted marketing, based on consumer behavior, which help our partners drive traffic and gross sales.  To support our partner program and maximize program effectiveness, we have dedicated on-site teams and marketing centers of excellent that work with our retailers to provide customized real-time solutions. Of course, our cardholders benefit from the promotions and loyalty rewards and the ability to finance and compartmentalize major purchases. We are also supporting our partners and cardholders through the evolving payment landscape. We have long viewed mobile logs as an important channel to our payment strategy. We have a platform today that allows customers to apply and buy, service their accounts and receive awards on their mobile device. Payments are the last leg of our development.  Our strategy is to build, partner and invest in the development of payment services that benefit our partners and cardholders. Our focus is security, ease of payment and delivery of an optimal value proposition and customer experience.  We are working closely with our partners to understand their preferences, as well as the preferences of our cardholders, as we evaluate which wallets make the most strategic sense. I think it's important to note that we are in discussion with key players, testing emerging technologies and piloting mobile payment applications, as part of our roadmap to developing long-term successful mobile payment solutions. And we're very pleased to announce today, that we have signed up to participate in the Apple Pay program for our Dual Cards. We will be in a position to place participating Dual Cards into the Apple Pay wallet. We have also invested in LoopPay, which is an innovative mobile payments platform company. LoopPay's payment technology is a mobile phone application and accessory case that enables mobile payments at the register, where you swipe your credit card. LoopPay works with most existing point-of-sale systems and allows consumers to upload any payment, loyalty or IV cards via a patented magnetic, secure transmission technology and does not require merchants to update point-of-sale hardware. In early September, the merchant customer exchange announced their payments, loyalty and offers platform called CurrentC, which is a mobile payment network. Many of our partners are engaged with MCX, so clearly, we are supportive of the CurrentC platform, as they work to continue to develop their capabilities. At the end of the day, it is our belief that consumers will choose the device they prefer to pay with. And it's our job to build the capability to play in the emerging technology landscape and to ensure that our cards have a very strong value proposition, so that the cardholders choose to put our partner's cards in their wallet of choice. Now I want to spend a few minutes on our growth opportunities.  We have demonstrated a strong record of winning new partners and renewing partnerships, a testament to our partner-driven operating model. We also have a track record of growing organically through increasing penetration at our retailers, by increasing the number of cardholders and getting a greater share of our customers' spend. We believe, we have a significant opportunity to increase the penetration of our retail card partners' more than $550 billion in sales volume.  Further, we have an opportunity to expand our focus on small business lending. We currently handle approximately $10 billion in annual small business purchase volume, and have some attractive capabilities that we believe, we can further leverage.  And to support our loan receivables, we are driving significant growth in our direct deposit base. Since the first quarter of 2013, when we acquired approximately $6 billion of deposits from MetLife, we have grown direct deposits to over $18 billion, as of the end of the third quarter, an increase of $12 billion in a little over 18 months. And we will continue to make investments in marketing the brand and building out the product suite and platform to grow our direct deposit business.  All of this contributes to our solid financial performance and profile. Since 2011, we have grown receivables nearly 9% annually, and produced a strong earnings profile. We have very attractive returns, strong capital and liquidity, and are well-positioned for future capital return, after our separation from GE. I'll now move to a discussion about the third quarter. The highlights on Slide 4 will be consistent with what I've just discussed. First, let's take a look at our financial results. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.70, which was driven by several key factors. Looking at the business as a whole, purchase volume was up 11%, helping drive receivable growth of 7% over the same quarter last year. Platform revenue growth was strong at 9%. Asset quality remained stable to slightly improving, with net charge-offs down 2 basis points and 30 plus delinquencies down 6 basis points. Expenses were in line with expectations. The increase was driven by investments we made to help grow the business and to support the buildout of our stand-alone infrastructure, as we prepare for separation. Capital and liquidity were significantly strengthened with our stock and debt issuances during the quarter. Tier 1 common capital was 15.1%, and high-quality liquid assets were over $14 billion at quarter end. Looking at our business highlights. We renewed 2 of our largest partners during the quarter, Lowe's and QVC. With Lowe's, we have now renewed our 5 largest programs through 2019 and beyond. In addition, we added nearly 1,000 partners to our payment solutions platform and nearly 9,000 CareCredit provider locations, since the third quarter of last year. I'll speak more to the performance of each of our 3 business platforms later. Aside from our successful IPO and debt issuance, some other highlights during the third quarter included the launch of a cash back value proposition that makes the new Sam\u2019s Club program the most competitive credit reward program in the club category, along with EMV chip-enabled technology to enhance security on the new Sam\u2019s Club Dual Cards.  We also launched EMV cards at Walmart. And our goal is to have all of our Dual Cards chip-enabled by the late 2015.  As you may have seen on various media outlets, we also launched our brand campaign to help build our business and banking platform. We had a stand-alone readiness plan that we're executing to build the infrastructure to operate as a separate entity from GE. We have made significant progress on this plan. We are also working with regulators to meet the requirements to operate as a separate regulated entity, as we progress through 2015.  Moving to Slide 5, for a perspective on our key growth metrics. Purchase volume for the quarter was $26 billion, an increase of 11% over the last year. This helped drive receivable growth of 7% to $56.8 million. Our average active accounts were up to 59.9 million, which is a 7% increase from last year. And platform revenue was up a strong 9% over the third quarter of last year.  We continue to feel good about the growth we're seeing across the business. Many of our partners have positive growth in purchase volume, and we continue to drive incremental growth through our value proposition and promotional and financing offers. On the next slide, I'll spend a few minutes discussing the performance within each of our sales platforms, before turning it over to Brian, to give you more detail on our financial results. We continue to see solid growth across all 3 sales platforms, Retail Cards, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Retail Card, which is a leading provider of private label credit cards and also offers Dual Cards and small-business products, partners with 19 national and regional retailers that collectively have over 33,000 locations across the United States. Retail Card accounts for approximately 2/3 of our receivables and platform revenue and we generated strong growth across our partner programs, growing receivables 6% over the last year. The growth helped drive platform revenue improvement of 10%. We also grew average active accounts 6% during the same time frame. We are actively looking at potential new programs and additional renewable opportunities in Retail Cards. Payment Solutions, which accounts for approximately 20% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, primarily, in the home furnishing, consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets. We have over 260 programs with 62,000 partners that collectively have nearly a 118,000 locations. The majority of our industry had positive year-over-year growth in both purchase volume and receivables. Performance was particularly strong in the home furnishing and automotive product market. Purchase volume was up 9% versus last year and average active accounts were up 9%, driving receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 6%.  Our marketing initiatives and improved penetration were among the key drivers of growth.  We are also actively pursuing a pipeline of potential new partnership opportunities in this platform as well and recently announced multiyear agreements with Select Comfort, the International Diamond Center and REEDS Jewelers to provide consumer financing.  CareCredit, which accounts for about 12% of our receivables and 70% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology services. The majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The reminder are national and regional healthcare providers.  We service a broad network of over 155,000 providers, with over 185,000 locations.  The majority of our specialties showed year-over-year growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with veterinary, vision and dental care turning the highest receivable growth. Purchase volume was up 5% and average active accounts were up 8%, driving receivables growth of 6% and platform revenue growth of 8% over last year.  In sum, a strong quarter across each of our sales platforms. As focused on expanding and deepening our partnership and programs yielded solid performance. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. Brian Doubles : Great. Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Page 7 of the presentation. The business earned $548 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. Overall, the business delivered strong top line growth, with purchase volume up 11% and receivables up 7%. If you adjust for the loans that were moved to held-for-sale, receivables were up 9%. Net interest income after retailers' share arrangements was up 8% compared to last year. It's also up 8% year-to-date. So this continues the strong trend that we've seen all year. RSAs were up $13 million or 2%, driven by growth in the programs, partially offset by increases on the provision and other expense lines.  The provision increased to $134 million compared to last year, largely driven by growth in the receivables and the year-over-year impact of the methodology changes we completed in 2013.  Asset quality continued to be stable. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.26%, down 6 basis points versus last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.05%, down 2 basis points versus last year. Other income was down $18 million or 16% versus last year. Interchange was up $19 million, driven by continued growth in auto store spend on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense, which was up $26 million, primarily, driven by the launch of our new value proposition at Sam\u2019s Club, that Margaret mentioned earlier.  Other expenses increased in line with our expectations and were driven by 3 key components : First, we're making investments to support ongoing growth, particularly in our retail card programs. As many of you are aware, we recently completed long-term extensions with many of our large partners and as part of those renewals, we set aside more dollars in the marketing and growth funds to support those programs. Second, we also launched our new branding campaign in September, and continued our marketing efforts with a focus on our deposit products. And lastly, we continue to invest in the infrastructure build, as we executed our plan to separate from GE.  So overall, the business had a strong quarter. We executed on a number of key transactions, including the IPO and closing over $13 billion of new financing. We also made good progress on our plan to separate from GE. I'll flip to Page 8 and walk you through net interest income and our margins. Net interest income was up 7%, driven by strong receivables growth, which was partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest margin declined to just over 17%, which was in line with our expectations. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. First, it's important to point out that the yield on our receivables continues to be relatively stable. A small reduction of 21 basis points year-over-year was the result of a slightly higher payment rate in the quarter. The majority of the decline of approximately 230 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased the high-quality liquid assets on the balance sheet to $14.1 billion, which is up $12 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the Fed, which results in a lower yields in the rest of our earning assets.  Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate was up 14 basis points to 1.7%. We have had quite a bit of change to our funding profile, so let me give you a breakdown by funding source.  First, the cost of our deposits were down 18 basis points to 1.6%. This was largely driven by an increase in our direct deposits, which were up $10.5 billion versus last year. This is a very attractive source of funds for us, and we expect to continue to grow our direct deposit base going forward. Securitization and funding costs increased 24 basis points to 1.5%, driven by extending some maturities in our master note trust and the addition of $5.6 billion of undrawn securitization capacity. Our other debt costs increased 77 basis points to 2.4%, driven by the higher rate on the GE Capital and bank loans, as well as the unsecured bonds. It's worth noting here that the new bonds we issued are longer tenure, so we swapped out some shorter-term, variable-rate funding for longer dated, fixed-rate funding. So this should benefit us in a rising interest rate environment.  Let me close out on margins and make a few comments on our outlook for the next few quarters. First, we expect the margins on our core receivables will continue to be stable. In terms of our overall net interest margin, it's important to highlight that this quarter reflects a partial impact from the additional liquidity and funding cost. Once these are fully reflected in our results, we expect to see the net interest margin come down in the 15% range and remain relatively stable.  During the IPO, we provided guidance of 14% to 15% on net interest margin, so we do expect to be at the higher end of that range.  On Page 9, I'll walk through some of our key credit metrics. Before I get to that, however, I thought it'd be helpful to provide some perspective on the seasonal trends in our portfolio. As you can see in the charts, we typically see lower delinquency levels in the first and second quarters, which we believe is driven by the tax return season and consumers paying down holiday balances in the first half of the year. Charge-off rate naturally follows delinquencies, and so you see it hit a low point in the third quarter. And we typically see receivable balances grow, as well as delinquencies increase, in the third and fourth quarters, driven by vacation and holiday seasons. These trends have been fairly consistent over time, so that should give you a good framework on how to think about it going forward.  So let me turn more specifically to the results for the third quarter. Overall, we continue to see stable trends on asset quality. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.26%, down 6 basis points versus last year, 90 plus delinquencies were 1.85%, up 2 basis points. The net charge-off rate was also stable at 4.05%, down 2 basis points from last year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of receivables was very consistent, with the last 2 quarters at 5.5%. We also measure reserve coverage by comparing the reserves to the last 12 months charge offs and we're currently at 1.2x coverage, which equates to roughly 14 months' loss coverage in our reserve. This has also been very consistent all year.  In terms of our go forward expectations, overall, we feel good about our portfolio and our underwriting strategies. We also think that unemployment will continue to be fairly benign. So given those dynamics, we expect our credit trends to continue to be relatively stable.  Let me turn to Page 10 and cover expenses. Overall, the expenses were in-line with our expectations and were driven by overall business growth, plus incremental investments in the programs and our brand, as well as the infrastructure we're building as part of our separation from GE. Let me give you a breakdown of $153 million increase for the quarter. Employee costs were up $66 million, as we added additional employees over the past year to support growth in the business and the infrastructure build, as we prepare for separation. Professional fees were up $39 million. This is largely driven by consulting and legal expense related to our separation, as well as the continued investments we're making in our direct deposit platform to enhance our capabilities. Marketing costs were up $61 million, as we've increased investment in our programs, continued our marketing efforts around our direct deposit platform, as well as launching the new brand for the company. Other expenses were down $13 million, primarily driven by lower assessments from GE, as we begin the process to separate.  So overall, our efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, which still indicates a very efficient operation compared against other financial institutions. In terms of how we're thinking about the expense run rate going forward, we thought it would be helpful to reiterate the guidance we provided in the S-1 and give you an update on those estimates. First, we disclosed and we thought the incremental marketing expense from the renewals would be in the range of $100 million to $150 million a year. Our current estimate is $120 million, so very close to our original estimate. Second, we estimated a $90 million to $100 million of costs related to launching our new brand and continuing our marketing efforts on deposits. Here, we expect to be closer to a $100 million, driven primarily by the plans to continue to grow our deposit platform. Lastly, we disclosed approximately $200 million to $300 million of incremental costs related to infrastructure build. These costs are really spread across a few key areas, building out our stand-alone infrastructure, replacing certain services we received from GE, strengthening our regulatory and compliance processes and migrating to our own dedicated IT data centers. In these areas, we expect to spend approximately $250 million, which is a mid point of our earlier guidance.  So in total, we believe we're on track here and expect to be at the midpoint of the range we provided in the S-1.  On Page 11, I'll cover our capital and liquidity position. As you know, we had a very active quarter and made a number of changes to our balance sheet, as part of the IPO and the other transactions that we completed. So we wanted to start with an overview of the sources and uses from those transactions. First, the IPO generated just under $3 billion of proceeds, which were retained by the company. Next, we completed our debt offering shortly after the IPO. Given the strong demand, we are able to increase the size of the deal from $3 billion to $3.6 billion. Lastly, we received $9.5 billion of funding from a syndicate of banks and GE Capital. So with the total proceeds of approximately $16 billion, we repaid just over $8 billion of intercompany financing from GE Capital. We've also used the additional $600 million of proceeds from the bond offering to prepay the GE Capital and bank loans. Our strategy here is to continue to prepay both of these loans ahead of their contractual maturity in 2019. And then the remaining funds, approximately $7.3 billion, we used to strengthen our liquidity.  So turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 15.1% Tier 1 common under Basel I. This level places us among the highest in our peer group. This translates to 14.6% common equity Tier 1 under the fully phased-in Basel III guidance.  The only other point I'd make regarding our capital level is that consistent with our communications during the IPO, we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buybacks until we complete the separation from GE. So we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. So moving to liquidity. Total liquidity increased to $19.7 billion and is comprised of $14.1 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $5.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets.  Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined as part of the IPO. We've built a very strong balance sheet, with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.  On Page 12, I'll cover our funding profile. One of the primary keys to our funding strategy is to continue to grow our deposit base. We view this as a stable, low-cost source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $10 billion, and primarily, through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 54% of our funding. So we're well-positioned to meet our long-term target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. Funding through our securitization facilities was pretty flat year-over-year at just over $15 billion. However, we did extend some maturities and added the undrawn capacity to further strengthen liquidity. And as I mentioned earlier, we completed our first unsecured bond deal, which was well-received and allowed us to increase the size of the deal to $3.6 billion. The pricing was better than expected, which allowed us to go out a little longer in duration. Lastly, I want to talk through some recent developments related to the GE Capital loan. First, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on GE Capital for funding. So on October 6, we brought in an additional $750 million of bank financing and used the proceeds to pay down the GE Capital loan. Given this happened outside of the quarter, you don't see it reflected in the numbers, but the net effect is that the third-party debt increased to $11.8 billion and the GE Capital loan reduced to $655 million. This is a positive result for the business. Given the GE Capital loan carries a higher spread, this early pay down will save us approximately $15 million a year in interest expense. So overall, we feel very good about our access to diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to prepay the bank and GE Capital loans.  I'll turn to Page 13 and just provide a quick summary on the quarter. The business delivered strong purchase volume and receivables growth. We completed long-term extensions with 2 of our largest customers, and we continue to add new partner and provider relationships every day in Payment Solutions and CareCredit. We announced the agreement with Apple and continue to strengthen our mobile offerings for our partners and consumers. Our deposit growth is ahead of schedule, and we're on track to deliver our long-term target of having 60% to 70% of our funding from deposits. We will continue to manage a strong balance sheet, with capital and liquidity levels that are above our peer group. We also remain focused on building out our infrastructure and executing on our plan to separate from GE. And lastly, I did want to mention today that I provided some insight on how we're thinking about 2015. We are planning to provide some more specifics around our 2015 outlook, as part of our fourth quarter earnings call in January. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a few brief points on Slide 14, and then let Greg get us into the Q&A portion of the call. To summarize, we are a leader in the private-label credit card business and are in a unique position to capitalize on our deep partner integration and further leverage the compelling value proposition we provide partners and consumers. Our fundamentals are solid, with strong capital liquidity and our business generates strong returns. And looking ahead, we have attractive growth opportunities, particularly to further leverage data analytics and mobile and e-capabilities, as we continue to seek ways to provide even more value to our partners and consumers and stay at the forefront of emerging payment trends. Finally, we are generating strong deposit growth through our online bank and this should help support our growth objectives moving forward. In sum, we are well positioned to leverage our past success, solid foundation and unique market position to help drive growth with existing partners, as well as develop new partnerships and consumer relationships.  We look forward to reporting our progress on future calls and interaction with the investment community. We are very excited about the prospects for the future of Synchrony Financial and those critical to our success, our employees, partners and cardholders. That concludes our comments on the quarter. So now, I'll turn the call back over to Greg to open up for Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A session. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to 1 primary and 1 or 2 follow-up questions, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : I wanted to start with loan growth. You noted 9%,  including held-for-sale. Can you just maybe help us better understand some of the components across the platforms, how much is coming from new account additions versus willingness for customers to take on additional debt. And Margaret, you did note across both Retail Card and Payment Solutions that you are looking at new partners. Just how active is the pipeline? And how should we think about the timing of these announcements? And was there any impact from the IPO process, potentially slowing the announcements of these potential new partners? Margaret Keane : Okay. So I'll have Brian start, and then I'll answer the second half. Brian Doubles : Sure. So Ryan, we've continued to see strong growth across all 3 platforms. As you highlighted, excluding Dillard's and Meijer, which we moved to held-for-sale in the second quarter, kind of the core is up 9%. That's spread pretty evenly across the 3 platforms. So we still continue to feel pretty good about the growth that we're getting. It's both new account growth, as well as active account growth. So one of the things we've been very focused on particularly, in Payment Solutions and CareCredit, is getting that repeat purchase volume. And so now, if you look at CareCredit, 47% of our purchases are repeat transactions. If you go back 5 years ago, we're -- it was probably one and done. You weren't getting that repeat volume. So that's been a big focus of ours. And then, also in the Payment Solutions platform, repeat transactions are 24%. Again, 5 years ago, that was probably close to 0. So I would say it's a combination of all of those drivers that have given us strong growth. Margaret Keane : So Ryan, on your question about growth strategy, I'd say first of all, we still have -- our biggest opportunity is still driving organic growth, which we're very focused on. But what I would tell you is we reorganized our business development team. We've added additional resources to really jump on the opportunity for what's out there in our pipeline. We have a very active pipeline. We're really focused on all 3 platforms. We felt good about what's in our pipeline. And I think, you saw in our announcement today particularly for our Payment Solutions, we announced REEDS Jewelers, as well as the International Diamond. And I think, you can expect to hear more of that in the coming months for all 3 platforms. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then, my second question would just be related to separation, a 2-part question. First, Margaret, from an higher-level, would you be able to give us a timeline on the milestones that we need to see for you to reach separation? I mean, clearly, you're investing a lot of these different initiatives, but it would be helpful just to understand what some of the key initiatives and things we need to see, before you go to the Fed. And then, for Brian, on separation expenses that you outlined in Slide 10, the $470 million or so that you would expect to incur, how much of that is actually currently embedded in the run rate, that you show on the right side? And how should we expect to ramp-up to occur over the next few quarters? Margaret Keane : Great. So Ryan, as we said, we're still targeting late 2015. And they're really, a couple of key things that have to be accomplished. The first is, and you saw this in our expense build out, we need to demonstrate that we have standalone capabilities and we're operating as a stand-alone company. The second is, we will have to apply through an application process with the Fed. We're anticipating doing that first half of 2015. Once that happens and the Fed will come in and actually evaluate our standalone capability. So they're going to want to see that we have the infrastructure in place. So with that said, we're really targeting first half of 2015 to get the application done, have the Fed come in and then, the timeline after that will be contingent upon the approval from the Fed. Ryan Nash : And then, Brian, on the expenses? Brian Doubles : Yes, the expenses. I think, probably, the easiest way to think about it is if you just break down the spend this quarter and look at it year-over-year, so expenses are up $153 million year-over-year. $43 million of that is just related to growth in the business. The other $110 million is really tied to those 3 categories, that I outlined in the $470 million run rate for the year. So if you just take the $110 million and you annualize it, that would get you fairly close to the $470 million. So a lot of this is in our run rate already. There's going to be little bit of seasonality in some of the spend, so I would think about it coming in over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And then from there, we would expect our expenses to grow more in line with revenues. Ryan Nash : Got it. But we shouldn't see another big ramp up, is what you're saying? Brian Doubles : No, you shouldn't. Costs are going to grow in line with revenues. I think, you got 2 or 3 more quarters here of the build. But if you look at the third quarter, a lot of this is in our run rate already. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One just on the reserving and one on the digital platform. So on the reserving, Brian, I heard you highlight that the ALR ratio has been holding steady about 14 months, recently. I just wanted to understand if that's what you're anticipating, we should be keeping that to? Or is there anything incremental for credit deterioration that you're looking for, just seasonally speaking? Brian Doubles : Yes. No, Betsy, we're not seeing anything on credit deterioration at this point. If you look at the metrics, 30 plus is stable, 90 plus is stable and the charge-off rate is pretty flat year-over-year. So we continue to feel like credit's going to be, it's not going to get a lot better from here, but it's not going to get worse either. So that's how we're thinking about it. And if you look at the reserve profile has been fairly consistent. I did mention 14 months. The only problem with that metric is it's backward looking. Obviously, we reserve more on an incurred loss basis. So a more forward-looking view. But that is not a bad way to think about it, a combination of looking at the reserve coverage on receivables and reserves against the last 12 months' charge-offs. The one thing that you don't want to do though is to just take reserves over the current period charge-offs, because there'll be a lot of seasonality in that metric. So really use the last 12 months, is a much better indicator. Betsy Graseck : Exactly. So then, any build in reserve really is a function of the loan growth? Brian Doubles : That's definitely what we're seeing right now. So we expect to continue to build reserves in line with receivables growth. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, Margaret, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the digital that you talked about, and in particular, this recent article on you highlighting the Innovation Station that you drove over the past several years to increase card purchases significantly. What was it? 62%, or something like that, between 2010 and 2013. So I wanted to understand, if the digital activities that you're working on now are going to be able to drive significant growth from here? Or is it more table stakes? Margaret Keane : So, thanks for that question. So I would tell you that we continue to see great growth on online and mobile. And it's something that we're very focused in. About a little more than a year ago, I was out at Stanford University's Engineering School and actually spend time with the leader there, who works with really a group of millennials. And it really gave me the concept of how I really unleash the talent in the millennials on my team, and really create a different work environment for them. So we created this Innovation Station, which is really a cross-functional team. So it's really not only computer geeks, but also our risk teams, our operational teams to really figure out a unique way to really focus on ideation and accelerating our capabilities in the market. So what we're seeing and the fact that we've done this has really helped us to accelerate what are partners are looking for and what consumers are looking for. For instance, we do something called the Bolt session, where we actually bring partners and end consumers. And we take a business issue or problem we're trying to solve from a digital perspective and we actually by the end of the day have a prototype. And we can test it with consumers right there. So it's really a way for us to think more broadly about where the world is going from a digital perspective and something we're extraordinarily focused on. Betsy Graseck : And if I tie that into what you're working on with Apple Pay, can you help us understand how you're thinking about how Apple Pay is going to impact not only your card members, but your merchant partners as well? And then, do you see an opportunity for Apple Pay, beyond the dual cards, into the PLCC only cards? Margaret Keane : Sure. So why don't I just talk about our strategy around mobile payments in general. And the way we think about this is, we really want our cards in as many mobile wallets as possible. And I think, when you think about the consumer themselves, we're going to have to drive this from both our partners' perspective, as well as the consumer perspective. But at the end of the day, it's really going to be up to the consumer on how they choose to make their payments and what device they're using. So our strategy, right now, is really to work with all the wallets. We're not going to holdback just on Apple. And we are working with partners who do MCX, so we'll be partnering with them. The good news for us, and we're -- I should also say we're doing some of our own virtual payments, too. We have 2 applications out there now, where our partners have asked to create an application for them for payments. So we're really looking at this very broad base. For us, our applications today allow customers to apply and buy, service almost all of their account online and get the rewards. So we really see payments as the last leg of the stool. And then, our job is really to make sure we have a very strong consumer value proposition, so that the customers want to load the cards inside wallets. And then the last one I would tell you, we are interested in getting our private-label credit cards, as well as our Dual Cards into all the wallets. So we really view this as a big opportunity. It's really going to be a seamless experience from a customer perspective for us. And we're very excited about partnering with Apple on the Dual Cards for the partners that want to be on that application. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Donald Fandetti : Margaret, I was wondering if you could just provide an update on how you see the CFPB playing out, maybe over the next year or so, on deferred interest. And then secondarily, PayPal looks like it's going to be an independent entity. I don't know, if that has any impact on your 2016 renewal. Just thought I'd check in on that. Margaret Keane : Sure. So why don't I start with the CFPB first. So we will be supervised by the CFPB. They're one of our ongoing supervisors. We know that they are working on looking at deferred interest right now. The silver lining for us is that, we had gone through a review with them on our CareCredit business. And we believe that the learnings we got out of that review from CareCredit, we're applying them across the business. So I can't say, ultimately what they're going to ultimately decide, but we feel like, we had a little more insight to what they were looking for. And at the end of the day, their goal is really to be fair and transparent, or they want us to be fair and transparent to consumers, which is something we believe into. So that's about what I could say on the deferred interest portion. On PayPal, we've had -- we've been a long partner with the PayPal. We've been with them since 2014. Obviously, they're making a very big strategic decision to split off from e-Bay. We disclosed, in our S-1, that we would not be renewing their deal after 2016. So they will be moving on and exploring their own business in a different way. So that's where we are on PayPal. Operator : Our next question comes from the Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Richard Shane : I have one sort of conceptual question and then just one sort of housekeeping. Brian, you're going through and you talked a little bit about why the loyalty program expenses were higher, related to Sam's Club. The question I have for you is this, should we think about as coincident with volume or as a precursor to volume? Brian Doubles : I would think about it as coincident, Rick. So we loaded -- we launched the Sam\u2019s Club value proposition. That's part of what you're seeing in there. That's been very well-received. So as we rollout new value propositions, you're going to see that grow in line with our purchase volume. We kind of had a reset, I think, in the third quarter, because we rolled out some new very attractive value propositions. But it should definitely lineup with purchase volume going forward. Richard Shane : Okay, great. So it's not -- we shouldn't see it as an investment. We should see it tied directly to the activity you get each quarter. Brian Doubles : That's right. Similar... Richard Shane : Okay, great. And then on the housekeeping side, Can you just go through the end of the period asset balances for credit cards, installment loans, commercial loans and other loans? Brian Doubles : Sure. Let me give you -- let me start with commercial and small business. We ended at $1.4 billion, which is up 3.5% versus last year. Installment was $1.1 billion, which is down 21%, but if you remember, we completed the HI sale in the fourth quarter of '13. So if you adjust that out of the numbers year-over-year, the installment book would be up 8%. So that's certainly an area that we continue to grow. Richard Shane : Got it. And then the other 2 categories? Brian Doubles : Other... Richard Shane : I'm just trying to tie it up to the average balances you provide on the charts. Brian Doubles : Yes. Credit card is $18 million versus -- I'm sorry, other is $18 million versus $12 million versus last year. Credit cards was 55 -- $54.9 billion. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I just have a couple of questions. First is just on capital and M&A opportunities. When we think about your capacity to do M&A deals, how much are you constrained within the context of the amount of capital you want to have going into your submission to the Fed? And then secondly, on Apple Pay, one of your competitors seemed less excited to kind of put their private-label cards onto Apple Pay. And I was just wondering, what you guys see in that interaction with Apple Pay that might lead you to believe differently? Margaret Keane : All right. Why don't I take the Apple Pay question and then, I'll turn the M&A question over to Brian. I did hear that, Sanjay, that one of our competitors was less -- our view is that this emerging technology is just the next step in the process for how customers are using their digital devices. So if you think about our cards today, we're seeing really good growth. And we also know that if a customer shops online, shops their mobile phone and shops bricks and mortar, we actually get more of their spend. So really, the payment is the last leg here. And we see this as a real opportunity for us to get incremental sales. And secondly, I think, given that hopefully these devices are going to be a lot more secure, we'll actually be able to reduce some of our fraud costs. So we see this as a real benefit to our consumers. Obviously, we have to work with our partners in selecting which wallets are good for them, but our goal is to try to be in as many places as possible. Brian Doubles : And on your first question, Sanjay, I would start by saying we've had an active dialogue with our regulators over the last 18 months. We tried to incorporate some of that feedback into how we built the balance sheet. We're at 15% Tier 1 Common, which compares very well against really any financial institution. We're going to build capital from here until separation. I think in terms -- longer-term, after we complete the separation, the way we prioritize our use of the capital is, first, organic growth. So this is still a strong -- very strong organic growth story. It will continue to be. Second, I'd say we're going to continue to look at platform, our portfolio acquisitions. Margaret talked about, we've got a great pipeline across all 3 of our platforms. That will continue. So we really view those 2 things as our core, and that would be our first use of capital. Then we're going to look to establish a regular dividend and buyback. And then, I would put M&A kind of fourth. And it's something that we spend a lot of time on. We look at all the time. But I'd say, we're going to be very disciplined around M&A opportunities. We're going to be very thoughtful about anything we do there. And they're probably going to be more capability building, as opposed to deviating from the core of what we do. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Couple of more follow-ups. Just on Apple Pay, one more follow-up on Apple Pay. Just to clarify, Margaret, there's no change in the way you could secure -- the amount of data that you could secure from the merchant, as a result of Apple Pay, right? And then, just secondly, on -- there were lots of articles on Conn's, the furniture retail store in Texas, during the quarter. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about the scope of your relationship with them, because it seemed like they were having some problems? Margaret Keane : Sure. So on Apple Pay, the way I would think about is similar to EMV, so there is that extra secure element. And I think the other is the fact that people tend to hold on to their wallet, I mean, to their phone versus sometimes their wallet or their cards. I think, there is a little bit more security there. But you're right. It's got the same kind of technology that SMB does from an NFC perspective and security. So to that point, I think, you're right. But I think, we just see these as another way to just add a bit more security out there in the marketplace around data and cards. On Conn's, what I would say to you is, I'll start and have Brian add a little more. First, we normally we don't comment on a particular partner like this, but given there is a unique situation and there's media out there, what I would say first is, they're a great partner. We've had them since 2009. Our job with Conn's is we actually underwrite the higher FICO portion of their book. We underwrite it ourselves. We hold those receivables, and we're not seeing any deterioration in the performance of the book that we have. I don't know Brian, if you would add anything. Brian Doubles : Yes. The only thing I'd add is, the Conn's portfolio that we have is $160 million of receivable. So it's 0.2% of our total. It's fairly small for us. And I'll just echo Margaret's comments, that it's performing very much in line with our expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. David Ho : I just wanted to talk about the retail sales outlook. Obviously, a little softening. As we get to the end of the year, you saw Walmart kind of reducing their same-store sales forecast. Obviously, a big part of your loan growth outlook. How do you see this playing out? And are you seeing any differences or changes in just the overall outlook for retail sales? Margaret Keane : So we're not really seeing any difference. We've had a fairly solid 2014, and we're expecting that to hold through the holiday season. I think, the holiday season will be in line with how we've been seeing sales all year. What I would tell you, that consumer is out shopping, but I do think the consumer is definitely more cautious, particularly about big ticket spending. So I think, this is where they're spending more time thinking about what to purchase, how to purchase, and that's where I think promotional financing really helps that consumer make that purchase. But we're not really seeing any softening. On the Walmart comment, what I would say is, this is really where we bring value to our partners, when sales -- overall sales are softening, it's where we bring our capabilities to bear, and it's where we tend to have even greater connection with our partners on how to leverage the card program, our data analytics and CRM to really drive more sales and more customers into the store. So overall, we're feeling positive about the remainder of the year. David Ho : Okay. Just a quick follow-up. On the Walmart sales, do you typically, for mass retailers in general, do you still see 2 to 3x purchase volume growth usually with -- when you look at retail sales growth? Or is it smaller for the mass retailers? Brian Doubles : Yes, I think, it differs by retailer. And I wouldn't categorize it by mass versus -- part of this is the level of support for the program and the amount of advertising that we do. I think that's a driver. I think, when you look at it in its entirety and this has been very consistent over the last 4 or 5 years, you look at retail sales broadly, we tend to be 2 to 3x the broader retail sales market. Same is true, if you just look at revolving credit. It's been up 3%,  and we're up more than 2x that. So that ratio holds in total, but it gets difficult to segment it below that, to be honest. David Ho : Okay. And then, just a quick one on penetration rates. You guys have noted that about 28% from midsize retailers, a little lower for mass retailers. How are those trends trending in the most recent quarter? And how do you view that as an opportunity, outside of macro sales growth and some of the other online initiatives as the driver of loan growth? Brian Doubles : Yes. I'd say they've been very consistent. Our goal in each one of our programs is to continue to increase that penetration. And that's been consistent with -- you can't grow at 2x the retail sales broadly, if you're not gaining penetration every day, both from other tender types, as well as just gaining greater penetration within that retail partner. So that's continued to kind of hold true. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Mark DeVries : My first question is just a follow-up on your last point. Do you have any thoughts theoretically on kind of how far penetration rates at your merchant partners can go? Brian Doubles : I'd tell you that, we have some that are below 5% and we have some that are in the high 40% range. And so it really is retailer by retailer. But that's the kind of penetration that's possible. And on days where we run a certain promotion, it can be in the 80% range. I don't know if, Margaret, could you add? Margaret Keane : No, no. We had -- we always have a contest each year on how high we can go, and I think our max is 86%. Mark DeVries : Okay. So I assume you feel you're a long ways from the point where you kind of maxing out penetration with your individual partners? Margaret Keane : Absolutely. That gets back to the point of, if you think about just retail cards $550 billion in annual sales volume, our ability to drive just 1% penetration, that would be a big win for all of us. So that's kind of how we think. That's why we have to pay a lot of attention to organic growth, as well as new opportunities. Mark DeVries : Okay, great. And then on a related point, what's driving your retail card purchase volume growth to be meaning stronger than the actual account growth and receivable growth here? And do you have any sense for whether Dual Card is growing purchase volumes faster than private-label here? Brian Doubles : Why don't I start and then I'll -- the one thing you have to take under account when you look at the growth rates, if you're looking at purchase volume compared to receivables, receivables, if you adjust for held-for-sale, are actually up 10%.  And so then you'd see those 2 aligned more closely. So in retail cards, those -- that's where we moved Meijer and in Dillard's, into held-for-sale. Mark DeVries : Okay. And then the difference, if any, between the purchase growth you're seeing in Dual Card versus private label? Brian Doubles : We continue to see strong growth in both. We would typically see stronger growth in Dual Card, because we're flipping private-label consumer cards to Dual Cards over time. Our strategy is one where we start consumers out with a smaller balance and over time, we look to grow that line and ultimately, flip it into a Dual Card. So just that dynamic of the flip results in dual card growth outpacing private label. But we really look at it program by program, in total, and not so much by individual product. Greg Ketron : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America. Kenneth Bruce : You addressed a lot of my questions. I guess, maybe if you could address the RSAs in the quarter within the retail segment were up. I know you had called that out, pre-IPO. But could you tease out, essentially, how much of that was maybe one-time or where you expect that to be over the near-term and what some of the key drivers are within the RSAs, please? Brian Doubles : Yes. If you look at the RSAs, there's quite a bit that goes on there, Ken, as you know. So they were up 2% year-over-year. I think you had to start with the fact that revenue receivables growth was well in excess of that. So the RSAs take into account the other line items on the P&L. So you've got provisions and other expense that run through there as well. And so, if you look at RSAs as a percentage of receivables, which is not a bad way to look at it, I think it was down from 5.2% last year to 4.8%. We think 4.8%, that's a fairly normal quarter for us. And so, we would expect it to stay fairly consistent from here. There's definitely some seasonality there, though, that you have to take into account. Kenneth Bruce : And then, maybe just on that particular point, when does it seasonally higher? Is it -- got a larger fourth quarter effect? If you could just give us a little background on that? Brian Doubles : It tends to be a little bit higher in the third quarter, actually. Kenneth Bruce : Okay. And maybe, kind of following-up on a question Sanjay asked. There's been a number of deals that have been highlighted as possibly coming to market and on the M&A front. And I guess, the question is, do you think that you would be able to -- from a capital perspective, do you feel that you've got the capacity to be able to look at a sizable M&A transaction at this juncture? Or do you think that it would require some additional steps, if in fact, if you put yourself in a position to acquire one of those larger portfolios? Just in the context of, obviously, the separation, what you're building up for that, independent of maybe an M&A transaction, but obviously, a large one would probably stretch the capital base and what you might be able to do to accommodate that. Brian Doubles : Well, I think, I need to -- let me separate it into the 2 buckets. So I think, if it were a portfolio acquisition that was in our core, that would certainly be something that we would look to do and we would be conscious of our capital levels, particularly as we're in this application phase and working to get approval to separate. I think -- so those are things that we've -- like I said, we've got an active pipeline and we're going after those opportunities. I think any true M&A that's outside of what we would consider a core portfolio acquisition is probably unlikely here in the short term, as we work through the application process and get approval to separate. Margaret Keane : So we're going to wrap up the call, but just a couple of points. We're pleased with our progress since the IPO and we really are continuing to work hard towards -- driving towards separation. We have a very strong underlying team, and we're working on all the things we talked about today on the call. And while we're in a very fast-moving space, we really believe that we're well positioned to take advantage of the environment right now, both from a standpoint of our partners and the consumer. So thank you very much. And Greg? Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the conference call today, and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. And have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'll start on Slide 3, but before I cover those slides, I will begin with a review of our 2014 accomplishments. After I provide a fourth quarter summary, I will then turn the call over to Brian to provide more details on our results and review our 2015 outlook. 2014 was a hallmark year for Synchrony Financial with many milestones to mark our progress. One of the highlights of the year, as you are all aware, was our launch as a new public company, a large step toward our eventual separation from GE. Also, in preparation to be a standalone public company, we successfully added infrastructure to a number of key functional areas and operations to support our future standalone capabilities. This includes important capabilities such as our new data centers that have been certified and are fully operational. We are now in the process of converting our applications and IT infrastructure. And while achieving separation is of great importance to the future of Synchrony, we have also stayed focused on our business objectives. We have extended a significant number of our largest programs, extending our partnerships has been a key priority and we have lots of success here. We have been capitalizing on new business opportunities signing on several new partners across all three of our platforms. To better serve our partners and cardholders, we continue to enhance our existing offerings and invest in new strategies with a focus on innovation and mobile payment technologies. We are pursuing a wallet strategy that is partner and consumer-led. Our approach is to build, partner and invest in the development of payment services that embrace the latest technologies from across the industry to benefit our customers and partners. For example, we have a mobile platform that today allows customers to apply and buy, service their account and receive rewards on their mobile device. To further enhance our payment strategies, we are in discussions with key players, testing emerging technologies and piloting proprietary mobile payment applications as part of our roadmap to developing long-term successful mobile payment solutions. While developing this capabilities, we are maintaining the value proposition of our cards through the mobile payment process. Last October, we signed up to participate in the Apple Pay program for our Dual Cards, putting us in a position to place participating Dual Cards into the Apple Pay wallet and we continue to progress on this front for rollout later this year. And as we noted last quarter, we continue to work with our strategic partners such as LoopPay to enhance our capabilities and provide options to our customers of mobile payments. We are also working with MCX in deploying their CurrentC app for some of our partners. We are also forging partnerships with leaders in the mobile space to further enhance our capabilities. Most recently entering into a strategic partnership and investment with GPShopper, a leading, integrated, one-stop mobile commerce platform for retailers and brands. GPShopper builds integrated mobile apps and has significant retail expertise. Their mobile platform will enable us to launch mobile solutions with even richer features, including deeper credit integration across our whole partner base and facilitate the development of our mobile platforms for small to midsize partners. This will help drive an improved mobile shopping experience, greater customer loyalty and deeper engagement. We also believe credit is increasingly important as customers' shopping behavior is moved to digital. Our ability to offer instant credit at the time of purchase whether in store or digitally makes Synchrony well-positioned to capitalize on these trends given our competitive strengths and scale. And we are seeing the results of these efforts materialize in a significant increase in online sales activity I will cover shortly. Additionally, we launched EMV chip-enabled technology to enhance security on certain partners' Dual Cards and we are on track to have all Dual Cards chip-enabled by late 2015. Needless to say, we've had a lot underway and accomplished several key strategic priorities in 2014. From a performance standpoint, the overall fundamentals of the business remained strong throughout the year. Speaking specifically to the fourth quarter performance as outlined on Slide 3, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.64. During the quarter, purchase volume was up 11% with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Receivables growth was up 7% over the same quarter last year and platform revenue increased a solid 9%. As I noted, our focus on digital strategies has helped drive a significant increase in online purchase volume. For the fourth quarter, online purchase volume increased over 18% compared to the prior year. Asset quality improved with net charge-offs down 37 basis points and delinquencies down 21 basis points. We continued our strong deposit growth with deposits growing over $9 billion or 36% in 2014. Expenses were in line with our expectations. They were impacted by investments we made to help grow the business and support the build-out of our standalone infrastructure. Our balance sheet remained strong with Tier 1 common capital of 14.9% and liquidity of $13 billion at quarter end. Moving to our business highlights, we recently announced a new agreement with BP that will be one of our 20 largest programs when we onboard them midyear. In addition, we extended our partnerships with Rooms To Go and Yamaha, all within our 40 largest programs. We added over 2,000 partners to our team and solutions platform and over 9,000 CareCredit provider locations since the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the performance of our three business platforms in a moment. Lastly, as I outlined earlier, we have partnered with and made a strategic equity investment in GPShopper. Moving to Slide 4 for a perspective on our key growth metrics, purchase volume for the quarter was $30 billion, an increase of 11% over last year. This helped drive receivables growth of 7% to $61 billion. Our average active accounts were up to $62 million, a 6% increase from last year and platform revenue was up 9% over the fourth quarter of last year. We did have a gain on portfolio sales in the quarter and excluding this, platform revenue growth was 7%. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through our value propositions and promotional financing offers. On the next slide, I'll spend a few minutes discussing the performance with each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to give you more detail on our financial results. Our three sales platforms, Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit continue to generate solid results. Retail Card, which is a leading provider of private label credit cards, also offers our proprietary Dual Cards. Dual Cards are co-branded, but differentiated as they have the capability to act as a private label card within the retailer's sales channel. Retail Card also offers small business products. Through our Retail Card platform, we partner with 19 national and regional retailers that collectively have over 33,000 locations across U.S. The addition of BP will bring us to 20 partners. Retail Card accounts for nearly 70% of our receivables and platform revenue. Partner program performance was strong and broad based driving purchase volume growth of 12%, receivables growth of 6% and platform revenue growth of 7% excluding the gain on portfolio sales. Renewing and extending our programs has been a key priority in this business and we have been very successful here as I noted earlier. We now have nearly 90% of our Retail Card receivables under contract through 2018 and beyond. Our longevity and dedication in the private label space for over 80 years is certainly helpful. The fact that this is our primary business, which we have been in for decades, is very important to our partners. It is also helping us win new programs, both existing and startup programs. We feel very good about the position we hold in this space and the partnerships we've developed and maintained. Payment Solutions, which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases primarily in the home furnishing, consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power products markets. We have 63,000 partners that collectively have over 119,000 locations. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts were up 8% over last year driving receivables growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 8%. The majority of our industries had positive year-over-year growth in both purchase volume and receivables. Performance was particularly strong in home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. We extended our Rooms To Go and Yamaha partnerships and we are also actively pursuing a solid pipeline of potential new partnership opportunities as well. CareCredit, which accounts for 11% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology services. The majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The remainder are national and regional healthcare providers. We service a broad network of over 156,000 providers with over 186,000 locations. The majority of our specialties showed year-over-year growth in both purchase volume and receivables with dental and veterinary turning the highest receivable growth. Purchase volume and average active accounts were both up 7% driving receivables and platform revenue growth of 5% over last year. In sum, a strong quarter across each of our sales platforms as our focus on expanding and deepening our partnerships and programs yielded solid performance. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. Brian Doubles : Great, thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. The business earned $531 million of net income, which translates to $0.64 per diluted share on the quarter. Overall, as Margaret noted, the company delivered strong top-line growth with purchase volume up 11% and receivables up 7%. Net interest income was up 5% compared to last year and this includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was raised to increase liquidity in the third quarter. The growth in interest income of 7% is in line with our receivables growth. RSAs were up $36 million or 5% driven by growth in the programs. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.6% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year, consistent with 2013 and our expectations. The provision decreased $21 million or 3% compared to last year. There are a couple drivers here worth pointing out. First, as you may recall in the fourth quarter of last year, there was an increase to the provision related to some enhancements to our reserve methodology, which did not repeat this quarter. Second, asset quality trends improved and charge-offs were lower year-over-year, which drove part of the decline. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.14%, down 21 basis points versus last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.32%, down 37 basis points versus last year. These items were largely offset by incremental provisions due to strong loan receivables growth. Other income increased $32 million versus last year, largely driven by a $46 million gain related to portfolio sales in the quarter. Excluding the gain, other income was down $14 million driven by the following. Interchange was up $31 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spend on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million primarily driven by the launch of new value propositions last quarter. Debt cancellation fees of $67 million were consistent with prior quarters; however, they were down $21 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses decreased 2% as the prior year's quarter included charges related to certain regulatory matters. After adjusting for these charges, other expense increased due to three main drivers, which we discussed last quarter. First, we're making investments to support ongoing growth, particularly in our Retail Card program. As many of you are aware, we recently completed long-term extensions with many of our large partners and as part of those renewals, we set aside more dollars in the marketing and growth funds to support those programs. Second, we also launched our new branding campaign in September and continued our marketing efforts with a focus on our deposit products. And lastly, we continue to invest in the infrastructure build as we execute our plan to separate from GE. So overall, the business had a good quarter. We had strong balance sheet growth and solid top-line growth generating an ROA of 2.7%. Next, I'll move to Slide 7 and walk you through net interest income and our margin. Net interest income was up 5% driven by strong receivables growth, which was partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest margin declined to 15.6%, which was in line with our expectations. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, approximately 300 basis points, was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $13 billion, which is up $11 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the Fed, which results in lower yields than the rest of our earning assets. The yield on our receivables declined 47 basis points as a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter and the impact of portfolio mix given the growth we're seeing in our promotional offers and payment solutions. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%. Given the changes in our funding profile, I'll walk you through our breakdown by funding source. First, the cost of our deposits was fairly stable, up 6 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor of our direct retail CDs, partially offset by strong growth in our lower rate savings account product. Our deposit base increased over $9 billion year-over-year. We view this as a very attractive source of funds for us and we expect direct depositors to be a larger funding source going forward. Securitization funding costs increased 25 basis points to 1.5%. This was driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of $6 billion of undrawn securitization capacity. Our other debt costs increased by 67 basis points to 2.7%, which is due to the higher rate on the GE Capital and bank loans, as well as the unsecured bond. It is worth noting here that the new bonds we issued are longer tenor, so we have replaced shorter-term variable rate funding for longer-dated fixed-rate funding. And this should benefit us in a rising rate environment. Over the past two quarters, our margin has changed significantly due to the factors I just noted, the primary drivers of the liquidity build and the cost of the new funding sources we put in place after the IPO. As we enter 2015, the transition of our balance sheet is largely complete and we expect our margins to be relatively stable going forward. I'll cover this in more detail later in our 2015 outlook. On Slide 8, I'll walk through some of our key credit metrics. Before I get to that, I thought it would be helpful to provide some perspective on the seasonal trends we see in the fourth quarter. We typically see receivables grow during the holiday season and you also see a corresponding increase to the allowance as well. However, the allowance coverage as a percentage of receivables typically comes down a bit in the fourth quarter just given a significant portion of the holiday balances pay down in the first quarter and don't translate into losses. So overall, if you look at the trends in the third and fourth quarters last year compared to what we're seeing now, they are fairly consistent. So turning more specifically to the fourth quarter results, as I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to slightly improving trends on asset quality, 30 plus delinquencies were 4.14%, down 21 basis points versus last year, 90 plus delinquencies were 1.9%, down 6 basis points. The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.32%, down 37 basis points after excluding the charge-offs associated with the non-core portfolio sale last year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.28%, which is down 18 basis points from the prior quarter given the seasonal dynamic I mentioned above. Another metric you can use to measure reserve coverage is to compare the reserve to the last 12 months of charge-offs. We're currently at 1.26x coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months of loss coverage on our reserve. This has been fairly consistent throughout 2014. So overall, we feel good about the performance of our portfolio and our underwriting approach. And based on what we're seeing today, we think credit trends will continue to be stable. Let me turn to Slide 9 and cover expenses. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations. Expenses did decline from the prior year, but the fourth quarter last year included $118 million in charges related to regulatory matters. Excluding these charges, expenses increased $103 million and were driven primarily by incremental investments in our programs and our brand, as well as the infrastructure we're building as part of our separation from GE. So looking at the key expense line items for the quarter, employee costs were up $37 million as we added additional employees over the past year to support growth in the business and the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation. Marketing and business development costs were up $48 million as we've increased investment in our programs, continued our marketing efforts around our deposit platform, as well as launching the new brand for the company. Other expenses were down $103 million, mainly due to the charges related to the regulatory matters I mentioned earlier. So overall, our efficiency ratio was 32.4% for the quarter, which still indicates a very efficient operation compared against other financial institutions. Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. So looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy is the continued growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program and this puts deposits at 56% of our funding. So we are well-positioned to meet our long-term target of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable at around $15 billion or 24% of our funding. We did issue a little over $800 million of new securitization debt in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the year, we extended some of our maturities and added the undrawn capacity to further strengthen our liquidity. Lastly, I want to walk through some recent developments related to our funding. So first, as we've said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility and GE Capital for funding. These are more expensive forms of financing for us and not part of our long-term funding strategy. So on January 5th, we made a $1.8 billion prepayment on the bank and GE Capital loans and given this happened outside of the quarter, you don't see it reflected in the numbers, but the net effect is that the bank term loan facility decreased to $6.6 billion and the GE Capital loan decreased to $523 million. This is a positive result for the business given the bank term loan facility and the GE Capital loan carry higher spreads than our other funding sources. So overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to prepay the bank and GE Capital loans. So turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 14.9% Tier 1 common under Basel I. This level places us among the highest in our peer group. This translates to 14.5% common equity Tier 1 under the fully phased in Basel III guidance. The only other point I'd make regarding our capital levels is that consistent with prior communications, we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buybacks until we complete the separation from GE. So we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. And post-separation, we'd expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers. So moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to $19 billion and that's comprised of $12.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. So overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined as part of the IPO. We built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. Moving to Slide 11, I'll cover our outlook for 2015. Our macro assumptions for 2015 are consistent with the consensus views on forward rates on unemployment, our framework assumes the Fed beginning to tighten later this year and stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our guidance for receivables growth is in the 6% to 8% range compared to the 5% plus we have communicated in the past. We believe a majority of the growth will be organic and we will continue to grow sales volume at two to three times the industries we operate in. This guidance includes our new relationship with BP, but doesn't assume any other new portfolio acquisitions. We believe our margin will be in the 15% to 15.5% range this year compared to our prior guidance of near 15%. Aside from normal seasonality, we believe the receivables yield and funding costs will be relatively stable in 2015. If rates do increase later this year, we expect our neutral to slightly asset sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income. In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we'll continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to achieve our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2015. We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and we will use the proceeds to continue to pay down both the bank term loan and the GE Capital loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019. In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving throughout 2015 and our plan not to change our underwriting profile, we believe our credit metrics will continue to be stable, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Our net charge-off ratio for the full year of 2014 was 4.5%. We tightened up our expectations on efficiency ratio from below 35% to below 34% as we have more visibility on 2015. This includes the incremental run rate costs associated with the separation, as well as the startup costs related to the BP program launch. We do expect to see some variation in this measure throughout 2015 driven by timing of the separation-related expenditures and some seasonality. Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets between 2.5% and 3% in 2015, which is consistent with earlier guidance and reflects the full impact of the changes to the funding profile and the balance sheet, as well as the separation costs. With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a summary of the quarter and our key priorities for 2015 on Slide 12 and then let Greg begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we exhibited strong broad based growth across several key areas. We signed a new agreement with BP and this will be one of our 20 largest programs. We also continued our success in extending a number of key partnerships and now have extended a large number of our relationships to 2018 and beyond. Looking ahead to this year, our strategic priorities are focused on generating growth across all three of our platforms with our partner-focused business model bringing value through mobile, marketing, analytics and loyalty capabilities. We have attractive growth opportunities in several forms. There is also ample opportunity to better penetrate our existing programs and we have a healthy pipeline, which provides potential beyond our organic growth opportunity. We will look to capitalize on opportunities to further leverage data analytics and mobile and e-capabilities as we continue to seek ways to provide even more value to our partners and consumers and stay at the forefront of emerging payment trends. We will continue executing on our direct deposit strategy continuing the substantial growth we have generated on the platform and driving our deposits to the target range of 60% to 70% of funding. And while we are focused on the strategies that drive our business, we will also be executing on our plans to separate from GE, including the filing of our application in the first half of this year and continuing the build-out of our standalone infrastructure. As you can see by our 2015 outlook, we expect to continue to operate with a strong financial profile and balance sheet this year. To conclude, we like our position and the prospects we have to leverage our deep expertise, solid foundation and track record of success with our distinctive market position. We are also very excited about the future of Synchrony Financial and look forward to continued progress towards our objectives. This concludes our comments on the quarter, so I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. As we do so, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you, good morning. Congrats on the BP portfolio win. I guess I was just wondering if you could just talk about the nature of the pipeline of new deals both in terms of size and pricing. Obviously, we're hearing that it's pretty competitive out there. And then I have got one follow-up. Margaret Keane : Sure, Sanjay. It's Margaret. So I would say that overall we have a solid pipeline in all three of our platforms. As you mentioned, we won BP. The other positives, nearly 90% of our receivables in Retail Card are already locked up till 2018 and beyond. We added a bunch of new partners last year in Payment Solutions and CareCredit. So I would say the competitive environment is a little more competitive than we've seen over the last three years, but I think a couple of things. I think one, our retailers and our partners are still looking for capabilities, people who are really going to come in and actually build their sales and help them build out their platforms and I think we have a key advantage there. I think the other thing is going through this process you really have to maintain discipline. We don't have to win every deal nor would we want to win every deal and I think you know this. Our number one opportunity is still organic growth. So our biggest opportunity is to continue to grow with the portfolios we have. So I think we can be patient and we can be smart about which of these portfolios we really want to go after. Sanjay Sakhrani : That makes sense. And then just my follow-up question is on the ROA trajectory. I guess there's some seasonality to that on a quarterly basis. Could you just walk us through that? Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Sanjay, this is Brian. So in terms of the seasonality and I guess I'd start with kind of where we ended in the fourth quarter. If you think about the first quarter and second quarter, I'd probably use the midpoint of the ROA guidance that we provided for 1Q and 2Q and then typically we see the ROA come up a bit in the third quarter and that's where we see the low point on charge-offs. That's been pretty consistent over time, so you see the ROA pick up a bit in the third quarter and then it comes down a bit in the fourth quarter and that's driven by just the higher marketing spend that we have, as well as some incremental provisions for the growth in the balance sheet. So that should give you a pretty good way to think about it for the year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great, thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Margaret Keane : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One, could you update us on how you're thinking about how the MCX launch this year is going to play into your strengths and maybe a little bit about what you intend to do to capitalize on it? Margaret Keane : Sure. So I think we've said before that we think mobile wallets are a key part of what we want to play in going forward. And our goal is really to be in as many wallets as we possibly can. And as you know, many of our partners are working with MCX, so our team is working with our partners, as well as MCX to be part of that platform. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And expectation is that's a midyear release? Margaret Keane : I really can't comment on that. I think our team is still working through. I don't know if we have definitive dates, but I would say definitely within this year, you will see us in a couple of wallets and MCX would be one of them. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then follow-up question is just on the reserving outlook. I know there was a bit of a built here. I just wanted to understand given the fact that you're looking for stable NCOs next year, the reserve build is largely likely to be a function of loan growth. Is that an accurate assumption? Brian Doubles : Yes. I think that's the way to think about it, Betsy. The provisions in the quarter and what we saw last quarter are really driven by growth. The credit trends really across the board continue to be stable to slightly improving. If you look at just the quarter year-over-year, 30 plus was better, charge-offs were better, 90 plus was a little bit better as well. So we feel good about the overall credit trends that we're seeing. And similar to what we said last quarter, we don't think they are going to get a lot better from here. We certainly don't see them getting worse than where they are. At least as we look out to 2015, we feel like we've got fairly good visibility that far out. Again, we're calling for stable to slightly improving unemployment. That's a driver for us. We're also not planning to make any changes to how we're underwriting today, so those are the two biggest inputs and how we think credit is going to trend next year and we think that if those are going to be stable to slightly improving that gives us some comfort that we think the charge-off trends and delinquency should be pretty stable as well. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that's super. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. I guess you kind of gave us a little bit higher metrics for a couple of the key factors and a little bit better growth, a little bit better net interest margin, a little lower expenses. I mean could you talk a little bit about what's underlying that because some of your competitors I think kind of have been going in opposite directions on some of those metrics? Brian Doubles : Yes. I think, Moshe, I'd say the key thing for us is when we provided the prior guidance, it was kind of a mix of short-term and long-term targets for the business. I think we've got better line of sight to what we think 2015 is going to look like. If you compare the guidance that we're providing for 2015, it's not that far off of what we actually delivered in 2014. So I think that gives us some comfort. We continue to see pretty solid growth. We don't have anything really bullish in there on retail sales. We're still assuming that we trend along at 2% to 3%. Our goal, as we've talked about in the past, is to grow two to three times the retail environment in the industries that we operate in. So that gives us some comfort that we'll continue to be in that 6% to 8% range. That lines up pretty closely with where we were in the fourth quarter. And I'd call the rest of the adjustments kind of slight enhancements to where we were previously and that's just really attributable to continuing to execute on the things that we have to execute on and just having a little bit better line of sight to 2015. Moshe Orenbuch : Certainly, all right. And just following up on the asset growth, anything that you can tell us about the consumers' willingness, ability and willingness to kind of carry debt that you're seeing? Margaret Keane : Yes. It's remained pretty stable. We're not seeing any big movements there at all. I would tell you that overall the consumers definitely continue to show positive momentum in terms of spending. I think consumer confidence is up, employment is up, certainly gas prices are going to help because people have more discretionary dollars. So we're not really seeing a big shift in how they are revolving with us. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Don Fandetti : Yes, Brian, you guys have made some very good progress with your online bank. There is some concern around what happens to the online franchises when the Fed raises rates. I was wondering if you could talk about how you factored in a deposit beta and what your overall thought on that risk is as you look out into potential rate hike. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Don. It's something obviously we're spending a lot of time working on right now and there's not a lot of history that you can draw from. Obviously, if you go back to 2004 to 2007, that was the last kind of rising rate environment where we had online banks. There's been quite a bit published around that time period and online banks had a deposit beta of 60 to 70. Branch-based banks were around 40. We expect to be in that 60 to 70 kind of range. To the extent that we're still trying to grow, it may be closer to 70 than 60. I think time will tell. I think there's a couple of things that you should factor in though first. Given the fact that we don't have expensive branch infrastructure to support, we feel like that's a pretty affordable deposit beta given our margins. So that's kind of how we've thought about it. That's factored into the net interest margin guidance that we provided for 2015. So we feel like we can manage a rising rate environment with the online deposit platform. Don Fandetti : Okay. And one housekeeping item. Were there two extra days of income in the quarter? Brian Doubles : I think one extra day. Don Fandetti : One extra day. Okay. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Lengler with Goldman Sachs. Jeff Lengler : Hi, good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Jeff. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Jeff Lengler : At least on the surface, it looks like the BP partnership is another contract that will have the Dual Card or co-brand capabilities. I guess as you think about new partnerships you could add, how much of an emphasis on these co-brand partnerships do you have versus traditional private label and can you just talk about the economics or margins as they compare to just the traditional private label? Margaret Keane : Sure. So we like co-brand and I think it's fair to say that our co-brand works a little different than our competitors in the sense that a traditional co-brand runs on the network when they are at the pump, if you will. And for us, our Dual Card runs on our closed loop network, so one of the big positives for us is we really get additional data as we work with those partners, as well as we don't charge interchange. So there is I think a difference there. In terms of our pricing, I think the way to think \u2013 they're actually very close in pricing, they just get there a little differently. I think there's higher receivables, loan losses and interchange on the Dual Card. Private label has more evolved, so that's really the difference. Jeff Lengler : Okay. And then just on liquidity, I think it was at like $13.4 billion or 18% of assets and it looks like you started to deploy a modest amount into investment securities. I know you're not subject to the LCR right now, but can you just remind us how you think about what is the right level of liquidity on your balance sheet, how much do you need to set aside for dry powder and do you have any preliminary estimates on where you would shake out on the LCR? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. So we use a variety of metrics to size the liquidity portfolio for the business. First, we run internal liquidity stress scenarios. We also look at our maturities coverage, wholesale maturity coverage and we manage to some metrics there and then we look at LCR and any other applicable regulatory guidance. And it's really a combination of those factors that help us size liquidity for the business. I'll tell you we're comfortably above LCR. LCR is not a constraint. We don't expect it to be a constraint going forward. The only thing I'd point out on liquidity, the fourth quarter tends to be a low point for liquidity for us just given the growth in the receivables balance. You'll see it come up a little bit in the first, second and third quarters as a percentage of assets. Jeff Lengler : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore. Brad Ball : Thank you. With respect to the separation application you said you're applying first half 2015, is it still reasonable to expect that you could gain approval from the Fed sometime in the second half and complete the separation from GE by year-end 2015? Margaret Keane : Sure. Let me give you a little flavor on that. So as I said, we'll submit the first half. We're making very good progress on the infrastructure build-out. We've hired a team. Our forward governance is in place. We brought up our IT data center, so we're moving our applications and infrastructure into the new data center. Treasury, risk, infrastructure are all there. So the way it's going to work is once we submit the application, the Fed will come in and do a review and what they're really going to be looking for is are we standalone ready. That process is new to the Fed in a way because we'll be the first company coming out after the crisis and it will be new for us. So our goal and our target is the end of the year, but the reality is it will be up to the Fed to give us that approval. Brad Ball : Great, very helpful. And then my follow-up question is on oil prices and gas prices at the pump. Are you seeing any notable impacts on either sales volume or on receivables and credit in the quarter, or so far this quarter and what's your outlook for the impact of lower gas prices in the business? Then just real quickly what's the size of the BP business? What's the size of the opportunity there? Brian Doubles : Sure. So let me start on your first question. I think it's still a little bit too early to tell if we're seeing any real impact from gas prices where they are. We expect this to be a positive for the consumer. Obviously, it should be a positive for us. We think with that additional discretionary income, they are going to certainly spend a portion of that \u2013 we believe they will spend a portion of that on our cards, so that's a positive for us. We haven't factored in any real lift there in terms of our outlook for 2015 just because I think it's still a little bit too early to tell, but it's hard to view it as anything but positive. So I think that's good. Then in terms of BP, we're not in a position to disclose the size of the portfolio, but even after we bring on BP, if we look at our concentration of oil and gas in the portfolio, it's less than 3% of receivables. So this is a space where we have continued opportunity to grow. It's a space we like. Brad Ball : Great, thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. I had a follow-up on the separation question. Assuming you are able to get the separation approved at year-end, can you remind us what that means for the timing of your ability to do a dividend and buybacks? Brian Doubles : Yes. So we're speculating to some extent. I think we've got to file the application, we've got to get through the process and then we will have a little bit better line of sight to how it's going to work post-separation, but our expectation is that after we receive the approval to separate, we would get a capital plan on file with our regulators very shortly thereafter and then subject to their approval, we would begin to deploy capital and start a regular dividend. So the timing is definitely post-separation, but it's a little difficult to get any more precise around it. Mark DeVries : Okay. And am I correct in thinking that the dividend would come first and then buybacks would be a subsequent event? Brian Doubles : That's right, that's right. Our priorities are dividend first and establishing a regular dividend for our shareholders and then looking at a buyback program. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. And then I just wanted to clarify something about the guidance. I think you indicated that on the 6% to 8% outlook for receivable growth, a majority of that will be organic. Although is most of the delta between the 6% and the 8% and the prior 5% plus the BP, or are you also more optimistic on your organic growth outside of BP? Brian Doubles : Yes. I'd say we've got a little bit better line of sight to our organic growth too and we're feeling more optimistic there as well. But the 6% to 8% does include BP. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Good morning. You noted that you plan to be about neutral to maybe slightly asset-sensitive towards the end of the year when most people expect rates to rise, but as you grow loans, do you anticipate some of the asset sensitivity rising given some of the more variable-rate loans? And how confident are you at increasing repricing opportunities in Payment Solutions and CareCredit purchase volumes, which tend to be a little more fixed? Brian Doubles : Yes. So there's a couple of things to think about, just where we ended the fourth quarter will again be slightly asset-sensitive so 100 basis point parallel shock to interest rates would take our net interest income up about $50 million. So that's fairly consistent with where we have been in the past. That's very slight from our perspective. Overall, our goal is to minimize the interest rate risk that we're taking. So we try and match our assets and liabilities by duration. We also look at fixed versus variable. The one thing, more specific to your question, to factor in for CareCredit and Payment Solutions is that those are fixed-rate assets to the consumer, but as rates rise, given the highly promotional nature in those businesses, we charge the merchants what we call a merchant discount and that is variable rate. So as we're bringing new business on the books, there's definitely an offset there in how we price those promotions to the merchants. David Ho : Okay. So the asset sensitivity could be a little understated. In terms of the strong volumes that you were seeing on the purchase volume side, how much of that was from Dual Card and how do you size that opportunity over time because we're seeing a nicer translation of the interchange fees versus some of your peers? Brian Doubles : Yes. We continue to see good Dual Card growth. We don't break that out separately, but part of the reason is if you think about our overall strategy for the most part is a low and grow strategy. We talked about this in the past. So we start out consumers with a smaller line PLCC card. And then over time we watch them and then we upgrade them to a larger PLCC line and then ultimately we upgrade them into a Dual Card. We like that strategy. We think its prudent risk management, but just given that dynamic of transferring an existing PLCC customer into a Dual Card product, you're always going to see higher growth rates in Dual Card. That's been fairly consistent. So I think that's one of the \u2013 that's certainly one of the drivers driving the Dual Card growth. The other thing I'd point out is we did launch some very attractive value propositions last quarter. The new value prop on the Sam's Club card, the 531 has been very well-received. That's performing probably a little bit better than our expectations, so we've been pleased to see that. So that's driving some of the interchange growth that you see as well. David Ho : Great, thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. You've essentially raised the outlook modestly in terms of asset growth. Asset growth is really derivative of purchase volumes. Just curious if you're assuming the correlation is exactly the same or there's any change there because I'm assuming a lot of this has to do with the BP contract, as you had mentioned before and just wondering if there's anything in the nature of that contract where that correlation is different. Brian Doubles : I would think about it similarly. I don't think when it comes to purchase volume receivables I would think about it different than our historic trends even with BP. Some of the oil and gas portfolios turn a little bit quicker so you'd see higher purchase volume and a little less translate into receivables. But generally, we like to provide receivables guidance for you guys just given that's how we earn the vast majority of our income. Interchange isn't as impactful for us, so that's why we thought the receivables guidance would be a little bit more helpful. Rick Shane : Perfect, thanks, Brian. And just to follow up on that, again, that contract \u2013 the cards will go into place in the second quarter. Should we assume that, and again you've talked about the fact that there are incremental reasons why you raised the asset growth guidance. We should assume, however, that a lot of that is going to be back-end loaded in the year. Brian Doubles : I don't know if I'd necessarily assume that, Rick. The majority of the growth continues to be organic growth. So I wouldn't make the assumption that it's back-half loaded. I would \u2013 it is probably easiest to model it with BP starting at the beginning of the third quarter, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't\u2026 Rick Shane : Got it. Brian Doubles : Assume that that's dramatically different than what we've been seeing on the organic side. Rick Shane : Brian and I apologize, I should have been clearer. The incremental on top of what you had previously given will be a little bit more back-end-loaded, not for the overall year. Brian Doubles : Yes. Specific to BP, I would build it in second half. Rick Shane : Okay, great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. There's been a lot of focus recently among the general purpose card issuers surrounding growth driven reserve building and in particular how growth tends to drive charge-off rates higher into the season and approach peak losses somewhere around year two. For you guys, your allowance as a percentage of period end losses seems very stable, but I was hoping that you could talk about how that growth dynamic is impacting you and whether there are any notable differences in the normal seasoning effects that you observe in private label versus general purpose card lending? Brian Doubles : Yes. Bill, I'd say the seasoning that we see in private label is pretty consistent to what you'd see in general purpose card. I think 18 to 30 months for peak charge-offs is pretty consistent whether you look at general purpose or you look at PLCC or Dual Card. So I think that's fairly consistent. There is some seasoning impact I think in our book. We're not seeing it as a big driver though and one of the things I think you have to take into account is that our growth rates have been very consistent over the last three, four years. And to the extent that you are putting on new business at the same rate that you put on business the year prior, you shouldn't see a big impact from seasoning. And so we're not seeing that I think to the same extent that maybe others are. We think the charge-offs and the growth rates are going to be fairly consistent and fairly stable. Bill Carcache : Thank you. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, I had a question, a follow-up on Dual Card and your comments there. Can you talk about whether you guys expect the longer term or how you're thinking about the longer-term credit performance of your private label versus your Dual Card products? I don't believe that in the last cycle that you guys were growing as much in Dual Card and I guess I'm thinking of that in the context of how in past cycles we've seen the greater utility in Dual Card generally result in higher credit losses while the limited utility of private label has actually been a positive. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about all that from an underwriting perspective on those products. Margaret Keane : Yes. I think one of the positives is the fact that in many of our retailers, we offer both products and I think that gives us some flexibility if we were to enter a cycle, particularly on origination. But I think the bottom line here is just how we do our underwriting. We talked about the low and grow strategy, so we start you out with a private label, give you a little bigger private label card and then offer you the Dual Card. So I think just how we go to market on our Dual Card is different than the traditional co-brand and gives us some flexibility in a crisis or a deteriorating credit environment. Brian Doubles : I think the other thing just to point out is that we're pretty disciplined on Dual Card around line sizes. So even though a Dual Card will carry a larger line than PLCC, we are not talking about the same kind of lines that you'd see in a general purpose card. Bill Carcache : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Werner with Morningstar. Dan Werner : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give me a little color on the deposit funding in terms of how much is brokered versus how much is through the direct bank and where do you see the growth rates for each of those going forward? Brian Doubles : Sure. I think we had a little over $12 billion of broker deposit funding. Our strategy with broker deposits, there are some advantages to broker deposits I think if you use them the right way and I'll just maybe spend a minute describing how we think about the brokered versus retail deposits. First, our goal is not to really increase broker deposits from where they are today, so we'll hold that relatively flat. We'll probably shrink it a little bit. You'll see that come down as a percentage of the overall funding stack. And right now, one of the advantages of broker deposits is that you can originate longer tenors and you can do it at attractive rates. I think the other advantage of broker deposits is there's no early termination or early withdrawal provisions on broker deposits. So it provides a very predictable funding base for the company and it works very similarly \u2013 looks very similar to a term loan, if you will. And so that's why we think it will continue to have a place in our funding stack, but it's not a funding source that we're looking to grow. So it will continue to shrink and it has over the last couple of years. Dan Werner : Okay. And this is as a follow-up. In terms of acquiring other card portfolios or other deposit bases, is that pretty much limited due to the fact that you're going through the separation process with the Fed? Brian Doubles : No. I think portfolio acquisitions that are in our core and align very well with one of our three sales platforms, we're definitely pursuing those. BP is a great example of that. So we don't feel like we're restricted on normal course portfolio acquisitions at all. We've been very active, as Margaret mentioned earlier, we've got a very active BD pipeline, so we continue to pursue those opportunities and we will continue to do so. Dan Werner : Okay. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Yes. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked, but a couple nuance questions. Number one, with respect to the NIM guidance, which is slightly up, what are the drivers of that, is there anything going on with yields or is it primarily related to the early January payoff of the debt? Brian Doubles : That's certainly part of it. I wouldn't read it as a significant change from the earlier guidance. We were guiding to near 15%. This is 15% to 15.5%. I think we've got better line of sight to how we think 2015 is going to play out. Maybe a slightly different expectation on interest rates played through there a little bit and I think we're optimistic that we'll be able to pay down the bank loan and the GE Capital loan well ahead of the contractual maturity. Just given those are more expensive forms of debt, we think we'll save a little bit of money there on interest expense. Those are related factors we were just able to tighten that up a bit. John Hecht : Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to the RSA, given the composition of the partners, the consideration of BP, anything that we should expect in terms of changing that as a percentage of receivables or should that be pretty consistent throughout the year? Brian Doubles : Well, it's been very consistent. In 2013, it was around 4.5% of average receivables. It was 4.5% in 2014. A couple small changes as we think about 2015. First, just given some of the value proposition launches, loyalty expense is up, that runs through the retailer share, so there was a partial offsets there. The two programs that exited in the fourth quarter we paid a disproportionately higher share in both of those programs. And so just by nature of those going away, that will save us a little bit on the RSA line. So I would think about it running just under that 4.5% range for 2015. John Hecht : Great. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Sure. Margaret Keane : So before we conclude the call today, I want to thank the investment community and especially our shareholders for their continued support. I also want to thank our team for a remarkable 2014. We really accomplished a great deal together this year. And the hard work will continue in 2015 as we seek to further leverage our distinctive market position and enhance our capabilities to help our partners and to grow our business. We like our position and prospects and we're very excited about the future of Synchrony Financial and look forward to continued progress towards our objectives. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for joining us today. I'll start on Slide 3; the overall fundamentals of the business remain strong in the first quarter with net earnings of 552 million or $0.66 per share. Our growth drivers continued their solid trends helping to drive purchase volume of growth of 10%, loan receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 5%. We're seeing the impact of compelling new value propositions such as The Sam's Club 531 cash back program which was recently recognized with a PYMNTS.com innovator award. Programs like this demonstrate the impact of engaging deeply with partners to help them develop innovative and effective ways to drive sales. Our focus on enhancing value for our partners and cardholders through digital offering has also helped to drive significant increase in online purchase volume. For the first quarter, digital purchase volume increased 18% compared to prior year. I will spend a few moments this morning outlining how our digital, loyalty and analytics capability are bringing value to our partnership. Asset quality improved with a 33 basis point decline in the net charge-off rate and a 30-basis point improvement in delinquency. Expenses were in line with our expectation impacted by investments we made to support the build-out of our standalone infrastructure as well as to help grow the business. We continue to generate solid deposit growth with the process increasing 8 billion or 28% over the first quarter of last year to 35 billion. Deposits now comprise 59% of our funding sources. And our balance sheet remains strong with Tier 1 common capital of 16.9% and liquidity of 14 billion at quarter end. Moving to our business highlights, we continue to capitalize on new business opportunities, forging partnerships across all three of our platforms. We extended our partnership with Amazon and now over 85% of retail card receivables are under contract to 2019 and beyond. We also announced a new Top 40 agreement with Guitar Center, the world\u2019s largest provider of musical instruments and recording equipment which we expect to launch in the second half of this year.  Additionally, we launched a new CareCredit exclusive endorsement agreement with VSP, the nation\u2019s largest vision insurance provider. We are excited about these new partnerships and our ability to bring significant value to these relationships. At the same time we still have a meaningful opportunity to driver organic growth and we continue to pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration. Also further progress has been made in our efforts to prepare for separation and we are on track to have the applications submitted to the [FED] in the second quarter. Our plans have not changed with GE\u2019s announcement last week that they are reducing the size of GE capital asset base. We continue to target separation by the end of this year. Moving to Slide 4; I want to spend the next few minutes outlining the achievements we have made to expand the value we deliver to partners and customers specifically as it relates to our digital, loyalty and analytics capability. We have long viewed online and mobile as important channels for our business. These channels have evolved considerably over the last several years and will continue to evolve. As customer shopping behaviors have increasingly moved to digital, the importance of credit has solid suite. Our digital strategies have helped drive a market increase in online and mobile purchase volume which is up 18% from last year. And nearly a third of our credit applications are done through digital channels. Our mobile capabilities cover the entire credit life cycle from acquisition to servicing to loyalty and payments. Our offerings include MFI which allows shoppers to securely apply for credit on their mobile device and instantly access their approved credit line. We also offer end service which allows customers to pay bills and service their account on their mobile device including obtaining their rewards.  During the first quarter we announced that our MFI product will be available to our payment solution customers. Since launching the mobile applications in 2011 we have processed nearly 5 million applications through this channel for our retail card, CareCredit and now our payment solutions platform. We also offer digital cards, our proprietary digital version of our cards that enables in-store count look-up and mobile payments functionality. Piloted in 2014, the digital card leverages geo-locations for authentication and home screen icon for easy access post in moment for participating retailers. In March we announced that we extended our digital card to our CareCredit platform enabling access to a digital version of our CareCredit card on their mobile device, since nearly half of all CareCredit purchase line is from existing card holders this was an important initiative. This coupled with our CareCredit online provider locator which received 600,000 hits monthly provides a power tool for increasing repeat purchases in this platform. Mobile wallets are an important development in the mobile payment space and we are excited to announce our participation in Samsung Pay leveraging both MST and NFC technologies. Samsung Pay is accepted at 90% of retail merchants and allows our partners and customers to access the unique features and benefits of our cards. As you know we also announced our participation in Apple Pay and we have partners that are engaged with MCX and their currency platform, so we plan to support that technology as well. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships we have developed a mobile platform that can rapidly integrate with mobile wallet while preserving the benefits of our cards. We recently made a strategic investment in GPShopper an innovator developed of mobile apps with a focused on the retail industry. This partnership helps us build on our existing mobile platform to more easily integrate credit into the shopping experience with personalized offers, enhance account serving and loyalty programs. We continue to design and launch new loyalty and value propositions for our partners. We are enhancing our loyalty capabilities by leveraging [indiscernible] platform to provide multi-tender loyalty programs allowing us to create a single seamless fully integrated loyalty solution regardless of tender yup. Multi-tender loyalty programs were enabling our partners to market to an extend customer base, give our card holders access to a more seamless loyalty rewards program and it allows us to access the additional perspective card holders. Our analytics capabilities are an important component of the value we bring to our partner and customers. Currently, we receive SKU or category level data on over half of all transactions that occur on our network. We offer our retailers actionable analytics, market research and creative services to help them drive sales. Our data access affords us a wide array of opportunities to better analyze card holder spending to understand what they are buying and how they are shopping. We then work with our partners to customize offers that will increase engagement, sales and loyalty.  Underlying our ability to provide distinct value to our partners and card holders is our proprietary close loop network. Our private label and co-branded dual cards run on our network which means that the transaction comes directly to us, enabling us to see the date of the purchase, name of the retailer, what brands and items were purchased and the channel through which this transaction occurred in store, online or via a mobile device. The volume of data to which we have access is immense and we've build the capabilities to transform this information into actionable insights.  In summary, we will continue to seek ways to build, partner and invest in the latest technologies to further benefit our partners and customers. It's an exciting time in the evolving digital landscape and we\u2019re committed and positioned to continue to deliver value. Slide 5 highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Purchase volume was 23 billion, an increase of 10% over last year. This helped to drive non-receivable growth of 7% to 58 billion. Our average active accounts were up to 62 million, a 4% increase from last year. And platform revenue was up 5% over the first quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continued to drive incremental growth for our value propositions and promotional financing offers.  On the next slide I will spend a few minutes discussing the performance with each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to give you more details on our financial results. We delivered solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. To our Retail Card platform we offer private label credits cards and a proprietary Dual Cards as well as small business products. The addition of DP which we announced last quarter will bring us to 20 retail card partners nationwide. Our retail card platform accounts for 68% of receivables and 69% of platform revenue. Our retail card performance was strong, with purchase volume growth of 10%, receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 5%. Renewing and extending our programs has been a key priority in this business. And as I outlined earlier we have been very successful in this regard. And we now have over 85% of our retail card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth. Payment solution which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 15% of our platform revenue is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases primarily in the home furnishing consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts were up 8% over the same quarter last year, driving receivable growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 8%. The majority of our industries have solid growth in both purchase volume and receivables including home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. We\u2019ve recently signed a new partnership with Guitar Center and extended our Top-40 partnerships with MEGA Group USA a 1,700 member national home furnishings buying group of independent retailers.  We also extended our Pep Boys partnerships, a key partner in our CarCareONE auto network. We continue to actively pursue a solid pipeline of potential new partnership opportunities in this platform. CareCredit which accounts for about 12% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue is a leading provider of financing to consumers for [selective] healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology services. Our partners in this platform are largely individual and small group of independent healthcare providers; the remainders are national and regional healthcare providers.  During the quarter the majority of our specialty showed year over year growth in both purchase volume and receivable, with dental and veterinary turning the highest receivable growth. Purchase volume and average active account both increased 6%, helping to drive receivables growth of 4% and platform revenue growth of 5% over the same quarter of last year across each of our sales platform we delivered solid performance and continued the momentum of signing new partners, renewing and extending partners and working to drive organic growth.  I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 7 of the presentation. In the first quarter the business earned 552 million of net income which translates to $0.66 per diluted share in the quarter. Overall, the company continued to deliver strong top-line growth with purchase volume up 10% and receivables up 7%. Net interest income was up 5% compared to last year. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year.  Interest income was up 7% which is in-line with our receivables growth. RSAs were up 66 million or 11%, driven by growth in the programs and improved credit performance compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.5% for the quarter consistent with the trends in both 2014 and 2013. We do expect the RSAs to trend just under the 4.5% level for 2015, consistent with what we communicated back in January. The provision declined 77 million or 10% compared to last year. The decrease was driven primarily by improving asset quality trends. There are a couple of things worth pointing out here. First, 30 plus delinquencies declined 30 basis points versus last year to 3.79%. And the net charge-off rates fell to 4.53% which is 33 basis points below last year. Our reserve coverage was fairly consistent compared to the first quarter last year, up slightly from 5.52% to 5.59%. Measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs the coverage remained relatively stable at 1.26 times. Other income decreased 14 million versus last year. The main driver here is higher loyalty expense related to the new value propositions we launched in the third quarter of last year. Interchange was up 24 million driven by continued growth and out of stores spending our Dual Card. This is offset by loyalty expense that was up 35 million primarily driven by the new value proposition. As a remainder, we run the interchange and loyalty expense back through our RSAs so there is a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $65 million were down 5 million from last year due to the fact that only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased 136 million versus the first quarter last quarter. Last year's results included a $44 million benefit related to a reduction in reserves for certain regulatory matters. Adjusting for that, expenses were up 92 million or 14%. The remaining increase was due to three main drivers all of which are consistent with prior quarters. First, we're making investments to support ongoing growth particularly in our Retail Card program. As many of you are aware, we have completed long-term extensions with many of our large partners and as part of those renewals we set aside more dollars in the marketing and growth funds to support those programs. Second, we also launched our new branding campaign in September and continued our marketing efforts with a focus on our deposit products. And lastly, we continue to invest in the infrastructure build as we execute our plan to separate from GE. So overall, the business had a solid quarter. We had strong balance sheet growth and good top-line growth generating an ROA of 3%.  I'll move to Slide 8 and walk you through our net interest income and margin trends. As I mentioned on the prior slide, interest income growth was strong at 7% in line with our receivables growth. This was partially offset by higher funding cost related to the additional liquidity we're carrying on the balance sheet compared to last year. The net interest margin declined to 15.79%, which was a little better than our expectations. This is due to using some of the liquidity that seasonally builds up in the first quarter to pay down the bank term loan facility and pay off GE Capital loan and I will cover this later when I discuss our funding profile. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, approximately 250 basis point was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $14 billion, which is up $9 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the FED, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets. The yield on our receivables declined 34 basis points as a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter compared to the last year and the impact of portfolio mix given the strong growth we're seeing in our promotional offers and payment solutions. As Margaret mentioned earlier, payment solutions grew receivable 11% over the last year. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.9%, up 28 basis points compared to last year. This is in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I'll walk you through our breakdown by funding source. First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable, up 9 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor of our direct retail CDs partially offset by growth in our lower rate savings account product. Our deposit base increased over 8 billion or 28% year-over-year. We continue to be very focused on growing our deposit base and making this a larger funding source going forward. Securitization funding costs increased 20 basis points to 1.5%. This is driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of 6.6 billion of undrawn securitization capacity. Our other debt costs increased 84 basis points to 3.2% due to the higher rates on the GE Capital and bank term loan facility as well as the unsecured bond. It\u2019s worth noting here that the majority of the new bonds we issued in the quarter are fixed rates, so we have replaced in variable rate funding for longer-dated fixed-rate funding and this will benefit us in a rising rate environment. Over the past several quarters, our margin has changed significantly due to the factors I just mentioned. The primary drivers are the liquidity build and the cost of the new funding sources we put in place after the IPO. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primary driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the GE Capital and bank loans. Given we don\u2019t expect a similar benefit in future quarters; we will likely see our margin move back in the 15% to 15.5% range we communicated back in January. And next I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 9, but before I get to that I thought it would be helpful to provide some perspective on the seasonal trends and impact allowance coverage from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. As you'd expect we typically see a significant receivables billed during the holiday season. The allowance coverage as a percentage of receivables typically comes down a bit in the fourth quarter as customers pay down a significant portion of the holiday balances in the first quarter and a higher proportion of delinquent accounts don't translate into losses. Then in the first quarter as the holiday balances are paid down, you will see the allowance coverage revert back to levels of more consistent with other quarters. As you look back at the 2014 allowance coverage, this will give you a sense for the seasonality. The coverage was in the 5.5% range for the first three quarters, very similar to our result this quarter. So looking more specifically to the first quarter results, as I noted earlier we continue to see stable to improving trends on asset quality, 30 plus delinquencies were 3.79% down 30 basis points versus last year 90 plus delinquencies were 1.81% down 12 basis points. We believe these improvements are driven at least impart by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer. Net charge-offs also improved to 4.53% down 33 basis points versus last year. Lastly, the allowance from loan losses as the percent of receivables was 5.59% which increased from the prior quarter for seasonality but was fairly consistent with the first quarter of last year. Another metric you can use to measure reserve coverage is to compare the reserve to the 12 months charge-offs. We\u2019re currently at 1.26 times coverage which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. This is always fairly consistent with the level throughout 2014. So overall we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trend we\u2019re seeing. To give in those factors we believe that our credit trends will continue to be stable. Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations. As I noted earlier last year\u2019s results included a $44 million benefit related to a reduction in reserves for certain regulatory matters. After adjusting for that item expenses were up 92 million or 14%. And this increase was driven primarily by incremental investments in our programs as well as the infrastructure we\u2019re building as part of our separation from GE. Employee costs were up 46 million as we added additional employees over the past year to support growth in the business and the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation. Professional fees were up 32 million due to both growth in the business as well as cost to separate from GE.  Marketing and business development costs were essentially flat to last year. We continue to invest in our programs and our marketing efforts around our deposit platforms as well as branding. However given the significant success in growing deposit and the excess liquidity in the first quarter we did see an opportunity to dial back some of the marketing cost for deposits. Information processing was up 11 million on higher IT investment and transaction volumes compared to last year. So overall our efficiency ratio was 32.2% for the quarter, which is below the 34% target we provided back in January. We continue to believe we have a very scalable platform and while the efficiency ratio will climb modestly from here through the remainder of the year we expect to stay below our target level of 34%.  Moving to Slide 11, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy is the continued growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year we\u2019ve grown our deposit by 8 billion primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 59% of our funding; we are well positioned to meet our long-term target of being 60% to 70% deposit funding. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion to $15 billion range which is approximately 24% of our funding. We did issue 750 million of new debt in March, the debt was five year fixed and price at 2.37% which was a little better than we expected given the strong demand. Our unsecured bond offerings have also been well received. In January we issued 1 billion of five year unsecured bonds, 750 million of which was fixed rate and price to 2.7%. The remaining 250 million was floating rate. Lastly, I want to highlight some recent developments related to the bank term loan facility and the GE capital loan. First, as we\u2019ve said in the past our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility and GE capital for funding. These are more expensive forms of financing for us and not part of our long-term strategy. During the quarter we made 3.2 billion of prepayments from the bank and GE capital loans, this included 2.8 billion of pro rata payments in January and February and then in March we made an additional $400 million payment on the GE capital loan which paid the loan off in full. Since the IPO we have paid down the bank and GE capital loans from 9.5 billion to 5.7 billion today, which is ahead of our original expectation. So we\u2019ve really made a lot of progress on the strategy to reduce a reliance on these sources. So overall we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We\u2019ll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility. Turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 15.9% Tier 1 common under Basel I. This translates to 16.4% common equity Tier 1 under the fully phased in Basel III guidance. And consistent with prior communication we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buyback until we complete the separation from GE, so we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. Post separate we\u2019d expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers. Moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to 20.4 billion and is comprised of 13.8 billion in cash and short term treasuries and an additional 6.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 28% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR level. Overall we\u2019re executing on the strategy that we outlined previously, we\u2019ve build a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity level. And with I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Brian, I\u2019ll close with the summery of the quarter on Slide 12 and then we\u2019ll begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter we exhibited strong broad-based growth across several key areas, continuing the momentum we've generated over the last several quarters. We continue to make our cards valuable to consumers, retailers and merchants. Notably in the first quarter we announced that our card would be available on the new Samsung Pay mobile wallet. Leveraging the early investment we made in [indiscernible]. From our business development perspective we continue to win and renew important partnership as well as sign key endorsements and maintain a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities. Our focus is steadfast; we will continue to deliver value to our partners and customers while leveraging strong engagement, innovation and advanced analytics to drive growth. At the same time we remain acutely focused on our preparation from separation from GE and look forward to providing update as we move closer to the finish line.  I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : I guess you had 7% growth in receivables and in core platform and across the company, in what is now turning out to be a little bit more sluggish probably industry setting than we had been thinking just a couple of months ago. Can you talk a little bit about how much the industry setting effects that and what might happen if things were to get a little better from a consumer stand point? Brian Doubles : This is Brian. I think it certainly impacts it a little bit. Retail sales in January and February were pretty soft. They came back a little bit in March; we saw a little bit pickup as well in our sales which is maybe a positive. I don't think it's enough to really read too much into it. If you look at our growth year-over-year certainly the value proposition that we rolled out in third quarter helped us a bit. If you adjust for portfolio exit our active accounts were up 8%. We\u2019re also seeing pretty good purchase volume per active account; it was up 6% versus last year. So that tells you that even though we\u2019re in a relatively weak retail sales environment. Consumers are still seeing real value on our cards and they are spending more on their accounts which is a positive.  Online sales were up 18% that continues to be a positive for us, and then if you look at CareCredit and payment solutions specifically as we talked about in the past one of the things that\u2019s benefitting our results here a little bit is just the amount of reuse that we\u2019re getting on the cards. It's the reuse for CareCredit as a percent of purchase volume was about 49%, that\u2019s up 45% last year. So that continues to grow, which is helpful. Payment solutions reuse was 26% which is up a little bit versus last year as well. So a lot of what we\u2019re doing to market to consumers in both of those platforms and create awareness around where you can use the cards is helping.  As we said back in January -- we were calling for retail sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, so our 6% to 8% receivable forecast was really based on that. So we didn't really have a lot of lift in the numbers based on retail sales. So I would say they are coming in a little bit below what we expected but not that dramatically off. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Just on a completely separate topic Brian. You mentioned marketing growth it looks I guess form the slides that the market expense actually flat in that, was it investments in other areas that were part of marketing? Brian Doubles : There is a couple of things going on there, if you look at just the marketing line, we made continued investments in the program that was offset by lower marketing spend on retail deposits. And so one of the dynamics that you see when you look year-over-year, when we were in the first quarter of 2014 and we\u2019re really ramping up the deposit platform ahead of the IPO we are spending a lot of marketing related to retail deposits.  Fast forward to the first quarter 2015 and we were -- we were still growing retail deposits but we were in an excess liquidity position so we saw that as an opportunity to dial back a little bit on the marketing spend related to deposits. So what you really got is incremental investments in the programs offset by lower spend on retail deposits. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess I had question on liquidity, understanding you guys want to stay on the conservative side. Could you just talk about how liquidity will ramp or not going forward just based on growth and then maybe how you might be able to reallocate some of the investments that you are investing in towards a little bit higher return type of assets? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Sure, so it's a little bit -- going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter you're always going to see an increase in liquidity just given the pay down on receivables. So we definitely saw that in the first quarter. We did us about 2 billion of that excess liquidity to make prepayments on the GE Capital and the bank loan, so as you know as we said in the past if we have the opportunity to optimize the amount of liquidity that we're carrying we\u2019re certainly look to do that. I wouldn't think about it going forward, I wouldn't think about a step change either up or down in terms of the absolute amount of liquidity that we're holding on the balance sheet. We're going to continue to run a very conservative balance sheet, we think that\u2019s prudent just given we're still building a track record in the capital markets, we've got rating agency consideration, regulatory considerations, et cetera. So I can tell you it\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on. We run lot of internal stress tests. We obviously look at the LCR guidance that's clearly not a constraint for us. We're looking at our maturities coverage and then in quarters where we do think we have an opportunity to use some of that liquidity and take out some higher cost funding and we\u2019ll certainly look to do that. The other thing is that we're looking at -- right now we've got about 40 billion of liquidity, 4 billion of that is in short-dated treasuries, 10 billion roughly is sitting in cash deposits at the FED. We're clearly not earning a lot on that liquidity portfolio. I think that's an opportunity going forward, a great start to move, one may look to do something a little bit different there. We don't have any plans to invest in anything that\u2019s not high quality liquid asset and you\u2019re getting a 100% credit for under the LCR guidance, but there is some opportunity to go out a bit on duration and pick up a little more yield, so you might see us do that in the future. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay that's helpful, just a one quick follow-up, it's on the opportunities out there for portfolio acquisitions within the private label area or co-brand area, maybe Margaret you can talk about what's out there. I've heard there is a number of deals up or out for renewal at some point in 2016 through 2017, do you guys have eye an on those as well? Thanks. Margaret Keane : So actually we see that our pipeline is pretty strong. I think we've mentioned we invested in additional business development resources and we've really kind of aligned ourselves around the three platforms, so I would say from a pipeline perspective in all three platforms we feel pretty good. I would also tell you that we're seeing opportunities in really two key areas; one is the first one you're saying which is portfolios that are up renewal; that are with competitors that we can go out after; and then the second is startup trust. So I've mentioned in the past that we like startups, many of our big portfolios that we have today were actually startups. So I think the team is diligently focused on growth. I think for us the really opportunity is really insuring that we pick those portfolios that really work for us. As we've said in the past, we have -- the biggest opportunity is really in organic growth. So as we continue to focus on organic we can be a bit choosier on the portfolios we go after to make sure they really aligned with the returns we're trying to achieve for the overall business. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : I just had a question on credit, the provision I think came in the low-end of expectations and your delinquency trends continue to show improvement and Brian I think you've said your outlook is for relatively stable, but how should we think about the trajectory of provisions for the remainder of the year? Should we expect to see losses show any further improvement and could we actually start to see some -- the level of reserves coming down a bit just given the positive improvement in credit losses? Brian Doubles : I think, as I've mentioned, the charge-offs for the quarter 30 plus, 90 plus were probably little bit better that we expected. We do we're getting a little of the benefit here on lower gas prices, improving employment helps, but it's really -- it's one quarter so it's hard to draw a much of trend from it at this point. The studies around gas prices say the consumers are -- they're using 25% of those gas savings to reduce debt. We definitely feel like we're feeling a piece of that in the numbers that's why you see the reserve coverage is held pretty stable. We didn't make a big move up or down, it's 5.59%, it was really more or less flat to where we trended all last year; up a little bit for seasonality, but very consistent to where we were last year. So I don't think -- we're not seeing anything absent a little bit of improvement from gas that would prompt us to call anything other than we think we\u2019re in a pretty stable environment right now and we don't see losses creeping up in the next 12 months, we don't see them getting a lot of better from here, add to that the significant change on gas prices. Ryan Nash : Got it and then just on your comment Brian about the [NIM] moving back into the 15% to 15.5% range, does that assume any further pay downs to the term loan and could we end up seeing more term loan paid down and maybe replace that with deposits so we could actually see if the [NIM] maybe running above the top end of the range? Brian Doubles : We had kind of the base plan that assumed a certain level of prepayments on the bank loan. So that\u2019s already -- a portion of that\u2019s already incorporated in the guidance that we provided back in January. Now in the first quarter we had an incremental opportunity to what we originally forecast and we took advantage of that in the quarter. We don\u2019t see anything incremental to the plan right now, but if we were to find ourselves with excess liquidity again you know our strategy is to make some additional prepayments if we can. The bank term loan facility runs out until 2019, we\u2019re obviously going to prepay it well in advance of that maturity. And we\u2019ll just kind of go quarter-by-quarter here and see if we can lean into it a little bit more. Ryan Nash : Got it. If I can squeeze one quick one, last one in there. Margaret just given what we\u2019ve seen across the industry competitively you guys simply in a very good position in terms of your maturities, your partnerships but has here been any consideration to trying to extent some of your bigger partnerships to locking the relationships? Margaret Keane : I think we mentioned that we actually have locked in many of our relationships as we were going through the IPO process and into this year. So we\u2019re always looking at ways to extend our partnerships and usually pumping pops up along the way whether it\u2019s a new product they want to roll out or maybe a different value prom. So it\u2019s kind of how we run the business. We\u2019re always looking at ways to really expand and expand the relationships. Right now we feel pretty good where we are, 85% of the retail card relationships are locked up 2019 and beyond. We just did Amazon which was a really nice win for us. There are couple of more we\u2019re working on. So I think this is kind of how we run the business and always looking to see how we can lock those up for a longer term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A little bit -- talk to Moshe\u2019s question on growth; is there any way to attribute either the loan growth or the purchase volume growth to increase penetration in various accounts versus average balance trends at the customer level? Margaret Keane : I would say if you look at the industries or the platform themselves we actually saw a very nice growth in our payment solution business and a lot of that was actually attributed to things related to housing, where we saw good and solid furniture sales, our auto business as well in that vertical as well. So I think the positive is that it seems like consumers are back spending on their home and reinvesting in their home; so we see that a positive trend. I\u2019ll turn it over Brian and see if he would add anything else on penetration. Brian Doubles : I think the [indiscernible] thing might just be helpful to describe a little bit how we measure our platforms. So if we take retail card we start at the beginning of the year with a sales plan for the retailer that we work with them on and then we measure those retail programs based on gaining penetration. So if the retailer is growing 2%, we\u2019re looking to grow sales on our card at least 4% to 6% and that\u2019s how we measure ourselves. So if you think about how we built the plan, I would assume generally retail sales 2% to 3% and purchase volume for us was 10% and the delta there is largely tender shift from general purpose card, other payment types onto our card. John Hecht : That\u2019s great color, thanks. Little bit of homer question that I know I can get from the 10-Q but if you have it handed, do you have the net charge-offs on cards versus installment loan versus commercial credit handy? Brian Doubles : I don\u2019t think we report that separately. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Don Fandetti : I guess at this point the most probable scenario is you would be regulated as a savings in loan, is there are any chance that you would have to go through formal [CCAR]? And then can you talk a little bit more specifically about a targeted payout ratio as the card issuers tend to have much higher payout ratios for the banks? Brian Doubles : Yes, Don you\u2019re right we\u2019ll be regulated as a savings and loan holding company so we\u2019re not technically subject to [CCAR]. It will be up to the FED on what they want to put us through. I can tell you though that we\u2019ve been preparing this we\u2019ll be subject to [CCAR], so we\u2019re running the same stress test, using the same assumptions, building the same models. We\u2019re putting in the same governance processes around our stress test and our capital plan. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re preparing. We do think that whether not we\u2019re subject to the formal [CCAR] the FED is very likely going to regulate us just like they regulate similar banks of our size. So that\u2019s our plan. Don Fandetti : Okay. Brian Doubles : In terms of payout ratio expectation I think there is a couple of things, obviously we don\u2019t report anything publically on our stress test so it\u2019s tough to get into a lot of detail, but there is a couple of things to think about. First we\u2019re starting up with very strong capital levels and we reported close to 17% Tier 1 common. Business generates very strong returns; the business model is fairly resilient in the stress similar to what you see from the other credit card peers. So we think we perform in a very similar fashion and overtime we would expect to have payout ratios that look very similar to our peers. Did you have one other question? Don Fandetti : Yeah Brian, thank you. Margaret is there any update on potential general purpose card issuance and then maybe other additional businesses given the success of your bank so far? Margaret Keane : I didn't hear the second part. Don Fandetti : In terms of any other potential products that you may look at given the bank success in the [indiscernible]. Margaret Keane : So we've mentioned in the past that we would like to launch a general purpose Synchrony Financial Card to our bank. The teams are evaluating that and working on it, that will probably be more of a 2016 launch than 2015 launch, but the teams working on that. In terms of other products I think we said we are really looking at the bank platform as a way to launch some other products, like checking, debit, bill pay. So that\u2019s another whole area that team is working on, again I think that will be more over 2016 launch. But plans are in place for that and the teams are hard at work figuring out the right way to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just two questions, one was on the [NIM] pressure that came from receivable yield and I know you highlighted that that was imparted from growth in promotional balances. So just wanted to a sense of how you are thinking about promotional balances, is it little bit more seasonal in the first quarter or should we anticipate a ramp as we go through the year? Just a little on how you are thinking about that. Brian Doubles : I would -- we tied it to a promotional balances, it\u2019s really driven by Payment Solutions just having a really great quarter and lot of growth year-over-year, they were up 11%. And if you look at Payment Solutions yield just compared to the average product portfolio or compared to CareCredit or Retail Card it is a lower yielding book. So that\u2019s the biggest driver. I wouldn't assume a ramp or seasonality in that, Betsy, I think Payment Solutions growth is just a little bit better than we expected, which drove a little bit of that yield decline. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Brian Doubles : And then the other factor that did have an impact in the quarter was just -- we did see some higher payment rates, lower delinquencies that obviously has an impact on yield as well. So those are really the two drivers. Betsy Graseck : So high quality problems? Brian Doubles : It\u2019s a high quality problem, we agree. Betsy Graseck : Okay and then separately on the plan of shifting more private label card to Dual Card. Could we please talk a little bit about plans and strategies and rollout for that and should we be bake in an acceleration in the model? Margaret Keane : I wouldn't bake in an acceleration. I think what we are always looking to do is look at growth both from our private label and Dual Card. One of the things we are always looking at is getting more of our partners to participate in the Dual Card and there is still some opportunities there that we are working through. Dual Card definitely is a positive for us in terms of driving growth on the overall portfolio and the other positive it gives us is when we can offer both products in a partnership, a private label and Dual, if we were to hit a cycle or bump, we can always just shift to getting out more private label credit cards to ensure we get the customer card in their hand but really protect us on the backend from losses. So that kind of our strategy and how we think about Dual Card. Betsy Graseck : Okay and you get some nice [indiscernible] on a Dual Card as well. So again just thinking out loud about how to model that, should we take in -- kind of growth rate that you have been generating recently? Or do you anticipate that there is going to be an acceleration, and I guess your point is more steady state acceleration. Brian Doubles : This is a strategy that we've had in place for four years where we start consumers up with a lower line on PLCC and we upgrade them overtime, and that strategy has been pretty consistent. If we are going to change that in future and do something bigger we would always come and we will describe it at that point. But it really is something that\u2019s been fairly consistent I would say over the last three or four years. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein. Kevin St. Pierre: If you could just approach the competition for existing portfolios from a different perspective. There has been a lot of news flow over the past year plus about retailers looking for potentially a credit utility to use a term that American Express put out there. Are you seeing any shift in your conversations or shift in the market towards retailers who are just looking for the best possible returns for themselves or has nothing changed in your mind? Margaret Keane : We haven't really seen a change there. What I would say is that the retailers that we talked to are the partners that we are going after. The number one thing that the retailer really wants is for us to describe how we are going to bring more sales in and how we are going to bring more customers and how we are going to have their customers be more loyal. And they really first start up by focusing on our capabilities and I think things like mobile becoming much more important aspect of their business as well as where we can come in and help them from a data analytics perspective, helping them do the marketing campaigns and really driving sale. We have not seen that shift where they are asking for things what would be outside of the normal things we would in a standard contract. So I haven't really seen any of that in any of the conversations that we've had. Kevin St. Pierre: Okay great and separately, on the deposit platform obviously strong growth year-over-year kind of flattish quarter-to-quarter but as you\u2019ve said, you sort of backed off a bit in the marketing. Do you have any sense or any metrics you could share with us in terms of market share gains either of deposits or deposit growth and how you're faring against other direct deposit gathers? Brian Doubles : We're definitely taking share, I don't have a specific number for you, but our growth rates have far outpaced direct -- other online direct retail program growth rate, and so that continues to be a big focus for us. So we've been very pleased by the growth that we're seeing. I'd say we're also -- the other place we\u2019re really focused is on retention rates and the retention rates on our CDs. We've bought the platform from that MetLife back in January of 2013. Retention rates were around 80%. They are up to 88% today, so there is -- there is evidence that our efforts there are definitely paying off. We rolled out a loyalty program where out deposit customers depending on how much they have deposited with us and how long they\u2019ve been a customer, they get access to travel savings and benefits. And so we think it's a really -- it's a combination of paying attractive rates, getting the right advertising program in place, but then also offering something else as part of the equation and that's what we're trying to do with the loyalty programs that we've rolled out. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Just moving back on the competitive environment, any view on the emerging online lenders and marketplace lenders looking at to obviously just throughout some of your channel like CareCredit and point of sale financings, and also there is obviously more talk about correlation partners in the U.S., do you see that as a threat or maybe on the flipside potentially an opportunity for you guys? Margaret Keane : Sure, I\u2019ll take that, I'll take that separately. So the first one; I would say -- we see competition really holding the way it been through this cycle and our pipeline continues to be strong, so we're feeling some of the pressure that I think others are seeing out there particularly on the bigger transaction. So for us, as I said earlier, our pipeline is really robust, we see it strong in all three platforms and we feel really good about where we're positioned. I think on the coalition question, I think it's a really good question. We have some experience in correlations, we have a network called CarCareONE which actually is a network comprised of our retail partners that are in the auto space if you will, and that correlations actually has turned out to be a very positive for us, we're seeing nice growth in that and that's where your card can be used at multiple paces. So if you have a Pep Boys card for instance you can use it in some of the other retail -- auto retailers that are in that correlation. So we like this concept, it's something that we're evaluating to see, could you expand that into other verticals, is there for instance an opportunity in a home vertical for instance, is something we've been talking about. We're definitely keeping our eye on this. I think as consumers shop they continue to look for opportunities rewards and feeling like they need some little lift to shop, so things like creating a correlations and offering rewards across network I think is a really important. In terms of the competition from some of these online [sales], we're really not feeling the pressure from them. I think their products are different, there installment products not revolving. I think Brian mentioned earlier particularly in our CareCredit business, we're seeing multiple reuse of our cards so we've really been able to really gain brand in the market place. And then lastly in terms of how they have to sell into the market, they have to actually sell on the -- and the CareCredit space you're actually going dental office by dental office to try to create an overall business and so we've been at this for our 25 years and we think it's going to them a little bit while to catch up to us. So we feel pretty confident about where we're against those competitors. Brian Doubles : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. James Friedman : Margaret, in your operating remarks you had commented about some of the growth in digital referencing to Slide 4, I realized in the footnotes that it says digital is both online and mobile, I was just wondering if you could parse those a little bit, what do you see in terms of the dynamics of mobile versus online -- yeah I think if you could share with us that, that would be helpful? Margaret Keane : It's hard to break that out. We're working on trying to figure out if we can get that metric because to go by a device and so for instance your iPad looks like an online versus mobile phone, so it's a little hard for us to break that out. What I would -- suffice to say, we think a lot of that is happening on, on more of the mobile side and iPad side of things if you will, so little hard to break that out. Needlessness to say, I think all of us now are -- if you could just and by me, how I shop, I think more and more this is a big growth area of us and something that we continue to have to really make that experience for that customer pretty seamless. David Ho : Just one quick one follow up, you say that digital growth was 18% year-over-year, is that a lot or a little, could you give us a reference point as to what it was previously as it accelerated? Margaret Keane : We think it\u2019s a pretty descent, if you look at it compared to what -- there is a metric out there that says overall in the U.S. it grew 15%, we grew 18%; so I think we are beating out what the norm is. So that\u2019s a measure to go on. Again, it\u2019s just continues grows quarter-over-quarter and it\u2019s not only on sales we see it on everything, the number of logins, the number of people who are on M-service now, the number of people who start mobile and only use mobile in terms of M-service. For us it\u2019s just a metric we continue to watch and know that it\u2019s a very important one and one that just continues to grow from all aspects of the platform. Brian Doubles : All right. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning, your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Thanks for joining us today. I will begin on Slide 3. The overall fundamentals of the business remained strong in the second quarter, with net earnings of $541 million or $0.65 per share. We drove strong growth again this quarter with purchase volume up 11%, loan receivables growth of 12% and platform revenue growth of 9%. We continue to see the impact of offering compelling value proposition, including our Sam's Club 531 cash back credit card program and the Amazon 5% reward program, wherein Amazon prime customers receive 5% back every day on their Amazon store card purchases. In addition, we rolled out an attractive new value proposition through a Driver Rewards and loyalty program with BP, a new partner which we have on-boarded this quarter and we also announced a new rewards program through our extension with Chevron. Asset quality improved with a 25-basis point decline in the net charge-offs rate and a 29-basis point improvement in delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, impacted by investments we made to support growth and the build out of our standalone infrastructure. Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.2% and liquidity of $14 billion at quarter end. We continue to generate solid deposit growth, with deposit increasing $7 billion or 24% over the second quarter of last year to $38 billion. Deposits now comprise 61% of our funding sources within the lower range of our targeted 60% to 70%. Our ongoing efforts to grow deposits and provide increase in value to our depositors, with new features and enhancements are yielding results. To improve the online experience for our customers, we recently redesigned our online banking platform, building a new technology such as a responsive web design, so that customers can have the same user experience regardless of which device they use. Popular feature such as mobile check deposit, customized email alerts and account balance snapshots are seamlessly integrated into the site. We have also streamlined access to our perks, loyalty and rewards program and completely redesigned our online account opening experience, demonstrating our commitment to bringing value and a great experience to our banking customers. During the quarter, we signed new partners across each of our platforms, extending key existing contracts and made technology investments, which are yielding innovative value-added services for our customers and partners. In fact, we were recently recognized by InformationWeek for our innovative mobile solutions across the entire credit lifecycle, ranking 48 on this year's InformationWeek Elite 100, a list of the top business technology innovators in the U.S. We were also recognized by CIO Magazine as part of their 2015 CIO 100 award program, which recognizes organizations worldwide that exemplify operational and strategic excellence in IT. We announced several new partners; among the biggest were Mattress Firm, the largest seller of bedding in the U.S., Newegg, a leading tech-focused e-tailer and Stash Hotel Rewards, an award-winning loyalty program for independent hotels in the U.S. and Caribbean. As I noted, we extended our partnership with Chevron, one of our 20 largest partners. With that, we now have nearly 88% of retail card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. Additionally, we renewed a CareCredit endorsement with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We are excited about these new partnerships and our ability to bring significant value to these relationships. At the same time, we still have a meaningful opportunity to drive organic growth and we continue to pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration across our partnerships. The online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business. As customer shopping behaviors have migrated to digital, the importance of credit has followed suit. Our digital strategies have helped drive a marked increase in online and mobile purchase volume, which is up 20% from last year and nearly a third of our credit applications are now done through digital channels. We have been working hard to ensure that the key benefits cardholders enjoy and the data our partners need are retained when transactions move to mobile devices. The big question with enabling private-label credit cards and Apple Pay has been around whether the capture of valuable transaction data would still occur. I am pleased to report that we have implemented a solution that will provide us and our retailers, access to the same level of data on transactions that go through Apple Pay. Another key point is that we have developed a mobile platform that can rapidly integrate across retailers and wallets, which will allow us to offer our unique value proposition to Apple Pay users. Benefits such as loyalty and rewards programs and point of sale discounts will be retained for our cardholders. We were excited to announce this quarter that we will be among the first issuers to offer private label cardholders the ability to add their cards to Apple Pay, and JCPenney will be the first of our partners to offer its private label cardholders the ability to make purchases with Apple Pay. We are also finalizing preparations to enable our private label and Dual Cards in the currency wallet and anticipate the launch to occur later this year and we are in active discussions regarding the integration of our private label and Dual Cards with Android Pay. We are pleased with the progress we have made on mobile wallets. The speed at which we have been able to adapt to ensure our cardholders can use our cards and their wallet of choice while maintaining the benefits for both cardholders and our partners speaks to our commitment to being at the forefront of this evolving landscape. Lastly, regarding our separation from GE, progress continued in the second quarter and we filed our application to separate on April 30th. The Fed has assigned a dedicated team to us and they have initiated their fieldwork, which we expect will continue through the summer. After they wrap this up, we expect that their findings will be submitted to the Board of Governors for a review and decision. We believe that obtaining approvals to separate will be focused on our financial strength and the infrastructure we have built to be a standalone business. Slide 4 highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 11%, and average active account growth of 4%. Additionally, the close of the BP acquisition contributed to the growth. Platform revenue was up 9% over the second quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing offers. On the next slide, I will discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continue to drive strong performance across all three of our platforms in the second quarter. Through our retail card platform, we offer private label credit cards and our proprietary Dual Cards as well as small business products. The addition of BP, which closed this quarter, brings us to 20 retail card partners nationwide. Our retail card platform accounts for 69% of our receivables in platform revenue. Retail card performance was exceptionally strong this quarter, with purchase volume growth of 12%, receivables growth of 14% and our platform revenue growth of 10%. We had strong receivables growth across our partner programs and the addition of BP contributed. However, the majority of our growth continues to be organically-driven. In addition to adding new partners that are a good strategic fit, renewing and extending our programs is a key priority in this business. During the quarter, we extended another one of our top-20 largest partners with the renewal of the Chevron contract, and now nearly 88% of our retail card receivables are under contract through 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the engaged partnerships we have developed, provide a solid foundation for future growth. Payment Solutions, which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 15% of our platform revenue is the leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, primarily in the home furnishing, consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets. This platform also delivered another quarter of strong performance with purchase volume and average active accounts, each up 8% over the same quarter last year. This drove receivables growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 7%. The majority of our industries had positive growth in both, purchase volume and receivables, including home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. Both, acquisition and renewals are also important in this business. We have had a lot of success in these fronts with the announcement of new partnerships such as Mattress Firm and Newegg, as well as a number of program extensions. CareCredit, which accounts for about 11% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, and vision and audiology services. Our partners in this platform are largely individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The remainders are national and regional healthcare providers. Purchase volume was up 9% and average active accounts increased 6%, helping to drive receivables growth of 5% and platform revenue growth of 8% over the same quarter of last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. In addition to the important endorsement, we renewed with American Society of Plastic Surgeons, we also announced a new CareCredit partnership with Vets First Choice. With this program, CareCredit cardholders will be able to use their cards to pay for online purchases of pet medicines and diet food products at more than 10,000 veterinary practice websites nationwide. Each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the signing of new partnerships and the extension of existing programs while driving organic growth. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $541 million of net income, which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase up 11%, platform revenue up 9% and receivables up 12%. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we are seeing across the business. We saw increases in both, purchase volume per active account as well as our average balance per account. These are both good indicator that our value propositions are resonating with consumers and they continue to see real benefits when they use our cards. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the quarter, which was a little ahead of schedule. Net interest income was up 7% in the quarter. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year. Interest income was up 9%, which is in line with our average receivables growth. RSAs things were up $31 million or 5% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.1% for the quarter, which was fairly consistent with the second quarter last year. Going forward, we would expect RSAs as a percentage of receivables to move back in the 4.5% range for the balance of the year. We typically see RSAs as a percentage of average receivables trend higher in the third quarter as seasonally lower charge-offs lead to a higher RSA level. The provision increased $59 million or 9% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth. The key asset quality metrics improved compared to last year, 30-plus delinquencies improved 29 basis points versus last year to 3.53% and the net charge-offs rate fell to 4.63%, which is 25 basis points below last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter last year to 5.38%. Measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.27 times. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable. Other income increased $8 million or 7% versus last year, driven by strong growth in interchange revenue and a pretax gain of $20 million from two portfolio sales. This was partially offset by higher loyalty and rewards costs associated with program initiatives. Interchange was up $31 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $31 million, primarily driven by the new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $61 million were down $9 million from last year; due to the fact that only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $8 million versus the second quarter of last quarter, primarily driven by growth in the infrastructure build, partially offset by a consumer remediation expense last year. We continue to make investments to support ongoing growth across all platforms and also had expenses related to the launch of the BP program, the EVM rollout, higher marketing in our programs and technology to support our mobile wallet strategy. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 33.5%, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, we had a solid quarter with strong top-line growth generating an ROA of 2.9%. I will move to Slide 7, and walk you through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income growth was strong at 7%, interest and fees on loan receivables was up 8%, partially offset by higher funding costs related to the additional liquidity we are caring on the balance sheet compared to last year. The net interest margin declined to 15.77%, which was slightly better than our expectations. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, 207 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $14 billion, which is up $7.5 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the fed, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets. The yield on our receivables was relatively stable, down three basis points compared to last year. This was a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter compared to last year. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%, up 20 basis points compared to last year. This was in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I will walk you through a breakdown by funding source. First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable, up 10 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor [ph] of our direct retail CDs, partially offset by growth in our lower rate savings account product. Our deposit base increased $7 billion or 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 61% of our funding, which is in line with the target we set of between 60% and 70%. Securitization funding cost increased five basis points to 1.5%. This was driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of $500 million of undrawn securitization capacity. Our other debt costs increased 68 basis points to 2.8%, due to the higher rates on the bank term loan facility as well as the unsecured bonds. While the second quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Looking ahead, we continue to expect that our margin will move back in the 15% to 15.5% range in the second half of the year. Next, I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.53%, down 29 basis points versus last year. 90-plus delinquencies were 1.52%, down 13 basis points. We believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. Our net charge-offs rate also improve to 4.63%, down 25 basis points versus last year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.38%, which was down 10 basis points from the prior year. If you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we are currently at 1.27 times coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. Overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends that we are seeing. Given those factors, we believe that our credit trends will continue to be stable for the balance of the year. Moving to Slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were in line with our expectations. While reported expenses increased 1% versus last year, as I noted earlier, we did have a $42 million consumer remediation expense in the second quarter of last year. Adjusting for this, expenses grew 7%, which is more in line with our receivables growth, but also included expenses associated with the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation from GE, as well as startup cost to launch the BP program and our EMV rollout. More specifically, the largest driver of the increase in expenses were employee costs, which were up $43 million as we added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were up $11 million due to both, separation related costs and growth. Marketing and business development costs were up $11 million as we continue to invest in our partners' program growth as well as marketing associated with our direct deposit products. Information processing was up $21 million, driven by higher IT investment and transaction volumes compared to last year. Other decreased $78 million versus prior year, primarily driven by the consumer remediation item I mentioned earlier as well as the GE cost allocations last year that were replaced by expenses in other categories The costs associated with the infrastructure build are now largely reflected in our run rate. While we will have incremental expense in the second half of the year related to growth in the EMV rollout, as well as investment in our digital capabilities, we expect our efficiency ratio will be in line with our annual guidance of below 34% for the year. Moving to Slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable and attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we have grown our deposits by $7 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 61% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. While we have now moved within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later next year such as checking and bill pay capabilities. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion the $15 billion range, which is approximately 23% of our funding. As we have said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business. We have continued to pay this down during the quarter making a $500 million prepayment on May 5th. Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $5.2 billion today. We also completely paid off the $1.5 billion GE Capital loan last quarter. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources; we will continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility. Turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 17.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 16.4% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. Consistent with prior communications, we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buybacks until we complete the separation from GE, so we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. Post separation, we would expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers. Moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to $19.8 billion and is comprised of $13.7 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 26% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously, we have built a very strong balance sheet with diversify funding sources and strong capital liquidity levels. With that, I will turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Brian. I will close with the summary of the quarter on Slide 11, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we exhibited strong growth across several key areas, making progress on several fronts and continuing the momentum we have generated over the last several quarters. We continue to make our products valuable to our retail partners, merchants, providers and consumers by enhancing our capabilities, developing compelling value propositions and creating innovative technologies such as our digital wallet capabilities. We are happy to see our digital wallet strategy take hold, we will be one of the first issuers to offer private-label credit cards and Apple Pay, and we recently launched our BP Dual Card in this digital wallet. We continue to win and renew important partnership and maintain a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities and we are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast-growing deposit platform. With the application now filed, we look forward to providing you updates as we continue to move closer to our separation from GE. I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries : Yes. Thank you. First question, I am interested to get any updated thoughts you may have on whether you will be included in the CCAR process following the separation from GE. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure Mark. This is Brian. We are not technically subject to CCAR just given our charter. We are a savings and loan holding company, not a bank holding company, so we are not technically subject to CCAR. With that said, we are certainly preparing is therefore going to be subject to the same oversight by the Fed, the same processes, so when the CCAR scenarios come out, we run those scenarios, we are developing our models in such a way that we believe they are CCAR compliant and meet the regulators' expectations. That is how we think about, governance of our capital, so we are building those processes, but it is unclear as of right now as to whether or not we will be formally subject to CCAR. Obviously, that is part of the application and the approval to separate. The Fed can subject us to CCAR or something that looks a lot like it, so that is how we are preparing. Mark DeVries : Okay, but no communication yet from them on whether they seem inclined to do that? Brian Doubles : Well, we can't comment specifically on our discussions with our regulators, but I think what is important here is, we are preparing is therefore going to be regulated just like other banks of similar size. You know you should assume that whether it is through CCAR or another means that the Fed is going to regulate our capital levels in a similar way. Mark DeVries : Okay. Fair enough. Then for Margaret, do you have any sense for when Amazon may start to more aggressively market the new 5% cash back rewards for prime customers? I got to tell you I am an active prime customer and I had to find out about the offer through Greg, so they are clearly not doing a great job of getting it out there. Margaret Keane : He is our great marketing guy. Isn't he? Yes. We rolled this out a couple of weeks ago and I think with any new offer, we really want to make sure that the offer is working. Obviously, the prime customer is an incredibly important customer to Amazon, so working jointly together with them, we wanted, one, to make sure the offer was working, two, that all of our processes and Amazon's processes were working really well to really give the best experience to the customer, so I would stay tuned. The plan is for this to be a big part of what Amazon is looking to do in the future. Obviously, as we said it is a great offer, so we are pretty excited about the potential. Mark DeVries : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. One question, I think you said, you purchased the BP portfolio in the quarter. Can you tell us what the dollar amount of that was? In addition to that, when should we see the impact of the new partnerships in the BP coming into the receivables volume? Brian Doubles : Sure John. We acquired BP towards the end of May, so it is in the EOP, but you do not have a full quarter's worth of purchase volume. I can't give you the exact size of BP. I can't disclose it, but I can tell you that our entire oil and gas portfolios are less than 3% of our receivables, so that will give you kind of an upper bound. That includes BP, Chevron, P66. John Hecht : Okay. Great. Then I wonder if you guys can give us maybe an update of the prioritization of your deployment of excess capital once the split-off is complete and you either go through a CCAR-like process or at least work with the regulators to determine appropriate capital levels. Brian Doubles : Sure. The prioritization has not changed. Organic growth is first and foremost the top priority along with portfolio acquisitions. We think that we have got a robust pipeline in all three of our platforms. We will continue to look to bring on new relationships. We brought on the BP portfolio, we just talked about we announced MattressFirm, which we think will be a great deal for us. That is going to launch in April of our 2016, so we will continue to compete and try and grow the business organically, so that is first priority. Second priority would be to establish a regular dividend and share repurchase program. Then I would say lastly, we will look at M&A. We are always looking at M&A opportunities. I will tell you, we will be a lot more disciplined around M&A compared to the other three alternatives as a use for capital just given the risk profile. I think if you see us do something on the M&A front, it will most likely be a very close adjacency to what we do today, so it will be something that will help us build out our capabilities, help our partners drive incremental sales in the programs, so that type of acquisition opportunity. John Hecht : Great, appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow ups related to separation. In terms of the costs, I know at the end of the first quarter, there was about an incremental $40 million of annualized costs still to come. Did that fully make it into the second quarter run rate or is there still an incremental portion in the back half? Brian Doubles : Yes. I did make it into the second quarter, so you should assume that the second quarter reflects kind of the end of that infrastructure build cost, so that is in the run rate of the second quarter. As you think about the second half as I mentioned earlier, we are going to have - there will be some incremental cost in the second half, but not tied to the infrastructure build. We are going to complete the rollout of EMV. You typically see marketing expense increase in the second half of year, so we would expect to see that again this year, so you are going to have those types of things that happen in the second half of the year, but I would not expect anything material incremental on the infrastructure built. Eric Wasserstrom : Has anything changed in your view about the $470 million sort of sustainable incremental post-separation cost? Brian Doubles : Yes. If we look at what is in the second quarter run rate, we came in very close to that estimate that we provided last year. Eric Wasserstrom : To the extent that the timing of the approval comes later than the year end, does that have any meaningful implication for your cost base? Brian Doubles : No. It does not. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Yup. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citi. Don Fandetti : Yes, Brian. A couple questions on interest rate sensitivity. It is my understanding that your estimates for rate sensitivity do not include any pass-through of higher funding cost to the retail. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to push some of that through specifically in your retail partnership business? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure. Don, you are right. The shock scenarios that we publish, and there hasn't really been a change to those. We are still mildly asset-sensitive, so 100 basis points shock interest rates takes our net interest income up about $75 million, which is less than 1%, so that profile has remained relatively consistent. We do have the opportunity in some of our agreements to pass-through higher funding cost. I will tell you that each one of these agreements is different, so I cannot give you a rule of thumb, because every deal works a little bit differently, but generally you should think about the deals working similarly and the fact that we calculate an after-tax return, funding cost is typically a component of that as well as credit costs and revenue and all the other P&L line items. We earn up to a hurdle and we share above that hurdle, so that dynamic holds true for the most part on interest expense, but every deal does work a little bit differently. Don Fandetti : Okay. Then secondly, can you talk about loan growth expectations, I may have missed it, but I did not hear guidance discussion. Brian Doubles : Yes. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter. I think, we are performing ahead of where we thought would be back in January, so we are very happy with the growth that we are seeing so far. I think the results are particularly good considering retail sales overall were somewhat sluggish. Retail sales in the second quarter were up 1.7% year-over-year and our purchase volume was up 11, so we are very encouraged by what we are seeing so far this year. In terms of the remainder of the year, you got a couple of big factors that you have to take into account. We have got back-to-school. That will give us a good indication on how consumers are spending. We have obviously got the holiday season that will largely determine where we end up for the year, but generally the growth trends are all moving in the right direction. We look at purchased volume. Proactive account was up 6%. We saw an increase in average balance per account as well, so those are both good indicator that consumers are seeing real value on our cards. You know Margaret mentioned that online sales were up 20%. The other thing that we should just highlight, we have talked about in prior calls the reuse that we are seeing in both CareCredit and Payment Solutions. CareCredit reuse was at 50% for the quarter that is up from 47% a year ago and payment solutions reuse was 27%. That is up from 26%. You know breakdown the quarter and look at the growth trends, they are all moving in the right direction and we are really pleased with where we are for the first half of the year. Don Fandetti : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : We have talked in the past quite a bit about mobile and I know you are doing a lot on mobile for the card and the reward programs that you have. I am just wondering are you also thinking about developing mobile products for the deposits business, your overall banking business as well? Margaret Keane : Yes. Actually in my opening comments I mentioned we have a new mobile platform, so we just rolled that out, so we took the learnings and capability we have on our card side and rolled it over to the mobile platform for our deposit customer and that is going extraordinary well, so the ability to open an account on a mobile phone is much better than it was and we have added a whole bunch of features on the mobile phone and we will continue to build that out as we add additional products. Betsy Graseck : Clearly your cardholders could also be managing their payments through deposits they have with you. Margaret Keane : Most of what they have with us is CDs and savings product. I think, as we move to adding checking accounts later next year that will be a definite positive there. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Then just one kind of ticky-tacky question on credit trends, I think you mentioned, Brian, that you expect credit trends to continue to be stable for the balance of the year. I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood, are you talking about ratios or dollars? Brian Doubles : More ratios, you know, credit is going to grow in line with growth in receivables, but we would expect the ratios to hold pretty consistent. We have said that all year. I think in the first and second quarter credit in a little better than we expected, we think, primarily driven by lower gas prices. Betsy Graseck : Right. Brian Doubles : It is just a little unclear how much of that is going to continue, but I think everything we look at still feels like credit will be stable. Betsy Graseck : Right, so NCO ratios stable and provisions moving up with balances as you do the reserve build associated with the balance growth? Brian Doubles : That is exactly right. We would expect to continue to build reserves for the new receivable growth. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Good morning, Margaret. Good morning, Brian. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Maybe a question on a comment you made, Margaret, about a healthy pipeline for additional opportunities for business wins. When I look back historically, I think somewhere around 200 to 300 basis points of loan growth has been added via portfolio purchases, can you just talk about your appetite for further portfolio acquisitions at this point for maybe the next 6 months to 12 months? Given that you have added a couple of start-up programs over the past couple of quarters, how much capacity is there to add more of those? Margaret Keane : The first thing I would say is, we have an opportunity to continue to grow organically, so I would start out by saying we can really be selective about what we go after. You know, our appetite to grow with new acquisitions whether it is an existing portfolio or a start-up is very strong. We reorganized our development team well over a year ago. We now have very dedicated resources in all three platforms, so we have a very healthy pipeline that we are looking at and it is really great to have a mix between existing portfolio and start-ups. Some of our biggest programs today were start-ups, so we are very bullish on start-ups. We know how to do them. Obviously it takes a little bit of time to get them to grow out of the gate, but once you get that engine going it really takes off, so we are very focused on both, driving the organic side, but more importantly, winning new opportunities in the market. Ryan Nash : Got it. Then if I could just ask a follow-up on, related to split up on a comment that you made. I think you mentioned, Margaret, that there is an on-site team and they were going to submit something to the Board. Can you just help us understand, you know, the process from here? What should we be looking for in terms of milestones? Obviously, they are going to make their presentation and then how should we think about the timing of that? Is it a back and forth dialogue? If you were to think about areas where you could potentially have concern that could cause us to delay into 2016, what would some of those concerns be? Margaret Keane : Yes. Overall, I would say, the team is on the ground. I can't really comment on the specifics, but I would say it has been a very good process. I think, you all know that we had done a pre-application well over a year ago and got very good guidance through a pre-application process of things we had to focus on. Obviously, we would not have filed the application if we did not think we were ready. Brian already mentioned that the cost of the infrastructure is already in our second quarter, so we feel that the things that we needed to focus on, corporate governance, risk management, our whole capital planning process, you know, model developing government and you know, IT infrastructure, which was a big one, are in place. They are in here, they will work through the summer. The question then becomes how quickly can a write-up their recommendation. Then it goes to the Board of Governors, which it is a little open to how that process is going to work, whether they do it in an existing meeting or they have a separate meeting, but our view right now is we are still targeting the end of the year. I think if it does slip into the first quarter, it really is just around the ability of the fed to get through everything that they have, the application is fairly significant, and getting this in front of the Board of Governors in the right timeframe, and I will have Brian comment a little bit about the timing at the end of the year, because we have certain windows, we have to do this within. Brian Doubles : Yes. Our expectation, Ryan, would be that we receive the approval that will be public. Very shortly thereafter, we would launch the exchange offer. We do have to manage around earnings blackout period for us and for GE, so there are specific windows that we can target for the exchange offer. It has got to be open 20 days. It could be extended another 10 days, so those are the things that we are managing as we look at when exactly we could get this completed. Ryan Nash : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Good morning. Just circling back on the loan growth from Dual Card, I know it is about 20% to 25% of your receivable balances. How quickly is that growing relative to the non- Dual Card portion of your portfolio? Brian Doubles : Yes. Dual Card growth, we do not break it out specifically, but it is growing and it will always grow faster than private-label credit cards. Let me just spend a minute and explain the dynamics there. We have, what we call, loan growth strategy. We start new accounts out with a smaller PLCC line. We increase that line over time as they demonstrate payment behavior and we get more comfortable with the credit worthiness of that consumer. Then ultimately, we upgrade them into a Dual Card account, so just that dynamic of the upgrade from a PLCC to a Dual Card, will give you higher growth rate, faster growth rate in Dual Card than what we see in PLCC. I cannot tell you that the Dual Card growth rates have been relatively consistent more or less in line with our expectations. I think, right now we have Dual Card programs in 14 of our 20 relationships, so there are still an opportunity I think to launch some Dual Card programs in the rest of the portfolio. David Ho : Okay. Given that the Sam's Club 531 card has very attractive, kind of similar value prop versus the Costco card. Do you expect any benefits from any kind of ongoing Costco card uncertainty as that potentially plays out and make it delayed? Are you baking in any kind of attrition into your core card op [ph] there? Brian Doubles : We are not baking anything in for that. I think, The Sam's Club value props stands on its own, it is a very attractive value prop, 531 and we have been very pleased with the results so far since we launched it. David Ho : Okay. Then separately on the deposit beta is obviously a lot of discussion this quarter across from your banking peers. It seems like you guys should be running closer to one versus some of your peers. Do you still think you could run near 75 or what kind of gets you confident that you could see and deposit betas will maybe a little lower than kind of what you are running at now? Brian Doubles : Well, I think there are a couple things. There is not a lot of history here, so I do not think anybody knows as rates start to rise what deposit betas are going to look like. The landscapes are a lot different than the last. The only time period you can really look at is 2004 to 2007 and deposit betas for online platforms were between 60 and 70. Are they going to be higher this time around? They could be. I think as we look at it, first, we do not have any significant investment, no investment tied up in brick-and-mortar branches. I think that helps us offset the impact if deposit betas come in higher. We have obviously got pretty healthy margins, so I think if deposit betas come in on a high-end or a little bit higher, that is still fairly manageable for us, so time will tell where this thing plays out. The other thing that we are doing, we have talked about this I think in prior calls. Right now, we are competing to some extent on rate and I think customer service. To the extent that we can rollout some of these new capabilities, Margaret mentioned, demand checking accounts, online bill pay, that will help us lower the deposit beta over time and that is absolutely in the plans and we are looking at rolling those out next year. David Ho : Okay. None of that is baked into you are kind of published asset sensitivity scenarios? Brian Doubles : No. It is not. David Ho : Okay. Great. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Most of my question actually have been asked and answered, but I actually was kind of intrigued that you had both, loan growth that was better than your spending volume growth and I guess a little bit of that was the acquisition of the portfolio, but still better and stable yield year-on-year. Could you talk a little bit about that? I would have thought that it is just a natural decay because of the stuff you talked about with respect to the way that portfolio has evolved? Brian Doubles : Yes. Again, I would attribute a big chunk of that to BP, in fact that we only had a month worth of purchase volume, but we had obviously brought on all the receivables at the end of the quarter. I think that is part of the biggest driver to think about. Other than that, I do not know that there are any other underlying trends to highlight. Moshe Orenbuch : With respect to just the yield on the portfolio, I mean, I would assume that like Dual Cards and other things like that probably have lower yields than some of your pure retail programs or some of the CareCredit things, right? Brian Doubles : Yes. Typically in a Dual Card product, you get back to the net return, but you get there differently. If I just compare a private-label return to a Dual Card return, Dual Card tends to be higher FICO customer, so you will see less revolve on your accounts, you see lower financed charges, but that is largely offset by lower losses. When you kind of net those to how you get back to a similar return that we earn on PLCC. Again, on Dual Card, obviously, you are earning on a higher balance, so you are getting incremental earnings. Moshe Orenbuch : Sure. Then just separately, you had addressed this partway to Ryan's question before about portfolio acquisitions. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you see out there. You said almost 90% of your business is contracted for the next four years, but what is out there in terms of portfolios that could be available over the next year or two? Margaret Keane : There is a plenty of portfolios. First of all the way we look at this is, just things coming up for us is always a natural set of portfolio that come up. I would not say Moshe, there is anything big out there. Moshe Orenbuch : Right. Margaret Keane : I think the big portfolios, there is not a lot of over $1 billion portfolios out there, but there is plenty in the $250 million up to $1 billion that I think we are looking at and going after. I think the other is just looking at the start-ups. I mean, it is interesting to note that a number of retails still do not have a program and believe it or not we are seeing more activity of people actually reaching out to us enquiring about doing a portfolio, so there has been a little more activity there. I think some of that is driven by the fact that as retail sales struggle a bit, having a program certainly helps and we have proven that by the programs that we do have. Then there is the whole online space and things that are happening there. From an activity perspective, we are actually going after all of those things and I would say that we are fine with, and you know that is going for smaller deal to a bigger deal, so I think it gives us an opportunity to look more broadly. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When we look back, I think it is easy to explain the post-crisis growth as a function of Synchrony was in the market providing capital when in general the supply was decreasing and we are now in an environment that is intensely competitive, supply has increased, we are seeing peers and one of the things we have noted is line limit increases, so a lot of the consumers with general purpose cards had sort of been unshackled, but you guys are still really generating strong organic growth. Brian, you talked about this a little bit, but what do you guys really think is driving this. Are we seeing a behavioral shift between general purpose and private label? Margaret Keane : Well, I think, I would attribute it to really two things. One, I think, we are seeing this in terms of consumer behavior. The consumers are still being conservative about how they expand. I think the value propositions on our cards, in fact that we have I think got a good machine running around how we are putting out the next software, how we are using data and analytics, when you talk about or what Brian mentioned earlier about the re use of our cards and Payments Solution and CareCredit, those are things that we have really put in place over the last couple of years. I would say the other big win for us is really our whole digital strategy. If Brian mentioned this or I mentioned this in my opening, our online sales were up 20% year-over-year. If you look at the overall industry, U.S. sales are growing at 14%, so we are getting a big greater share of those online sales. Our mobile applications are really growing. About a third of our applications now come through mobile. Then 42% of our active customers are actually interacting with us some way using our digital channels, so I think as the consumer behavior shifts to mobile. I think one big advantage that we have versus many other general purpose credit cards is you can apply and buy immediately and you could do it on your mobile phone. I think our ability to capture that customer at the sites of purchase I think is really a big, big opportunity for us, and one that as we continue to build out our data and analytics team to really drive that and I think I mentioned in the past, we have partnered with GPShopper, who actually has some great mobile asset that we are integrating our cards programs with, particularly true for the smaller retailers maybe do not have a team sitting there to help them build out a mobile application. We are working with them to have that happen, so I think the whole digital pieces is going to become a bigger part of who we are and important part of how we go to market. Rick Shane : Got it. Just to follow-up on that, I mean, as we enter into reporting season for peers as well, there are going to be a lot of questions over the next week about rewards and reward expenses. That's really where the competition seems to be playing out. We do not see that particularly in your margin or is there anything there that you are concerned about in terms of competitor behavior? Brian Doubles : You know, there is nothing we are concerned about. You do see our loyalty costs are up, driven by the new value props that we have launched, but I think we look at these costs fundamentally just different than I think you look at them for general purpose card player in that the partner shares a significant portion of these costs. What we like is that we can offer a very attractive value proposition like we launched at Sam's Club, and like we just recently launched with Amazon, and when it nets through with the RSA offset, we still earn a very attractive return on that program. These new value props that we have launched are good things. They are driving growth, they are driving incremental finance charge revenue for the business, the partner share and part of the cost, so if we have the opportunity to launch better value props in our other programs, we are going to continue to look to do that. So we do not feel it necessarily as competitive pressure so much as we do a real opportunity to drive growth going forward. Rick Shane : Got it. Great. Thank you guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Greg Ketron : Okay. Vanessa, we have time for one more question? Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I guess, I have one question on Payment Solutions. It seems like you guys are definitely ramping up there in terms of the new relationships. Is there something there in terms of the economy that we can infer from, just the acceleration in new relationships there and should we expect more of that to occur as things get better in a broader sense? Then I have another question just on the digital strategy. To the extent that you are able to enhance your capabilities, can that help you ask for more from your merchants in terms of revenues? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Sure. Let me answer the first on Payment Solutions. I think interestingly enough, Sanjay, I think, one of the things that has worked to our benefit, believe it or not, is the separation from GE. In fact that many of these partners are seeing us as this is all we are going to be doing. We are 100% dedicated to the retail market so our activity overall and Payment Solution has really picked up and some of it is, obviously, I said we dedicated resources and they are going after that. Even more importantly, we are getting people calling us, so I think there is a focus now that they know this is the business where are in and this is the business we are going to go after. We are very strong in that business, we have a lot and that is really the heritage of our business, right? We have a strong team there and I think, we have invested in things that I think have really help us from a technology perspective, which many of those retailers, you have the bigger guys, they have a lot of smaller retailers there who really look to us to help them really bring capabilities and I think that is something that has really played well for us. In terms of looking for more economics out of payment and mobile wallet, our goal is really to work with our partners to grow sales and we really see the wallet as really the final step in the process, so for us it is really building out the whole spectrum of the credit cycle applying, buying, getting a reward, getting your messaging and text messaging from us and then making a payment. I would not anticipate us looking to get more from our partners. We really want to work with them together in the overall relationship to grow the business, so that is how we are thinking about it and that is our business model, right, bringing capabilities and making it a better experience for their customers to really help drive volume growth for them. Sanjay Sakhrani : All right. Thank you. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to further answer any questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As most of you probably know by now, we received approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a standalone savings and loan holding company, following the completion of GE's proposed exchange offer. This approval represents a major step forward in Synchrony Financial journey to become a fully independent company. We are very pleased that we have reached this point. I want to thank everyone for all the hard work that has gone into this process, including my team, our employees and the help GE provided to us. We also want to thank the Federal Reserve and our regulators for working with us through this process. The next step in the process is the exchange offer, where GE will exchange its shares of Synchrony Financial common stock for shares of GE common stock. At this point, we are very limited and what information we can provide around that approval and the exchange offer other than what has been made public. As a result we will not be able to discuss any details around these issues on the call today. I will begin our discussion today on slide three, third quarter net earnings totaled $574 or $0.69 per share. Overall, strong momentum continued across our business platforms driving significant receivables deposits and revenue growth this quarter. Growth remained robust with purchase volume up 12%, loan receivables growth of 12% and platform revenue growth of 9%. We continue to offer attractive programs that resonate with customers, such as our Amazon prime card where cardholders receive 5% back, our Sam's Club 531 cash back credit card program below 5% discount on purchases everyday and reward programs with BP and Chevron, in addition to our ongoing promotional event. Our partners work with us as we continually search for innovative ways to drive program growth. Asset quality improved with 3 basis points decline in our net charge-off rate and a 24 basis points improvement in 30-plus delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, impacted by investments we made just for growth, separation-related costs and the completion of the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card holders. Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposit increasing $8 billion or 24% over the third quarter of last year. Deposits now comprise 63% of our funding, moving further into our target range of 60% to 70%. Our ongoing efforts to provide increasing value to our deposit with new features and enhancements are yielding notable results. Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.5%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter end. Key business highlights during the quarter included the extension of key existing contracts, including PayPal, one of our top 10 partners, the signing of two new partners, extension of our CareCredit network and further advancement of our technology platform to enhance the engagement experience with our customers. We are pleased to announce a long-term expansion with PayPal to provide Dual Cards to consumer. Our program with PayPal dates back to 2004 and these programs enable digital and mobile payments to online and offline merchants for qualifying cardholders. We're excited to expand our decade-long relationship with PayPal who is at the forefront of digital payment. We are also pleased to have renewed our partnership with Sleepy\u2019s, the third largest mattress retailer in United States, further enhancing the number of top retailers where we provide financing in the bedding space. Regarding new partners we have signed a multiyear agreement with Citgo, a leading U.S. refiner and marketer to provide a private label credit card program for new and existing customers. We expect to launch the program in the first quarter of 2016 and Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the nearly 5,500 locally-owned and operated Citgo locations in U.S. In addition, we are pleased to announce a new partnership with The Container Store, the nation's leading retailer of storage and organization products. This is a multiyear agreement to offer private label credit card program and the card will be available fees in the retailer's stores and online. The program is scheduled to launch in the spring of 2016. Additionally, we expanded our CareCredit network through a new agreement with Rite Aid, one of the nation's leading drugstore chain. Rite Aid will accept our CareCredit card for in-store purchases and health services in their nearly 4,600 stores nationwide. We also added a new multiyear agreement with Premier Dental Holding, one of the nation's largest dental provider. We're very excited about this new and extended partnership and our ability to add significant value to these relationships. Driving organic growth continues to be a key source of future opportunity and we continue to pursue initiatives to help card usage and deepen penetration across all of our partnerships. As we have noted in the past, the online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business. As reflected in our 2015 digital study, a comprehensive mobile strategy essential to the ability of retailers to effectively engage with our customers. In our national survey, we found that 45% of shoppers are now shopping with the mobile device and this is up 4 percentage points from last year. Additionally, one-third are purchasing products after viewing them on social media and one-third indicate that tax offers will drive an incremental shopping visit. Given these trends, we have been active in capitalizing on this evolving environment. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume, which is up 21% from last year and nearly a third of our credit applications are now done through digital channels. The adoption of our digital card also continues at a healthy pace. We continue to progress in our leading mobile wallet strategy and we are very pleased to be among the first issuers to offer private label cardholders the ability to add their cards to Samsung Pay, which launched in late September. We have currently enabled the use of over 12 million active accounts across our CareCredit and payment solutions platform and we intend to build on this. As many of you know, we have Dual Cards enabled and will be one of the first issuers with the capacity to offer private label credit cards through Apple Pay. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships, we are helping to shape the future of how private label card function in mobile world and provide value to our merchants and their customers. We have developed a mobile platform that can be rapidly integrated across retails and wallets. The speed at which we've been able to develop the capability for our cards to be in mobile wallet while maintaining the benefits for both our cardholders and partners speaks to our commitment to being at the forefront of this evolving payment landscape and our ability to capitalize on our leadership position. Moving to slide four which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 12% and average active account growth of 4%. The addition of the BP program last quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue was up 9% over the third quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing offers. On the next slide, I'll discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continue to drive strong performance across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter. Retail card had very strong performance this quarter generating purchase volume of 12% and receivables growth of 13%. The addition of BP last quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 10%. In addition to our new agreement with Citgo, we continue to expand our brand distribution with the launch of the Athleta credit program, one of the brand names on the gap. In addition to adding new partners that are a good strategic fit, renewing and extending our programs is a key priority in this business. Within the long-term extension of our program with PayPal, we now have nearly 92% of our retail card receivables that are under contract through 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this state and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. Payment solution delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 13% and loan receivables growth totaled 12% driving platform revenue growth of 8%. Average active accounts increased 8% over the last year. The majority of our industries have positive growth in both purchase volumes and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We exhibited significant success in finding multiple new partners this quarter, including the container store and our pipeline remains strong. We also launched new program this quarter, most notably Guitar Center, which included a portfolio conversion from another issuer and now gives us a preeminent position as a key financing partner in the music retail market. As noted, we extended our long-term relationship with BP. As a result of this, coupled with the announcement of MattressFirm in this summer, we now have programs with each of the top four bidding retailers in the U.S. CareCredit had a solid quarter and entered into important new agreement. Purchase volume was up 13% and average active accounts increased 5%, helping to drive receivables growth of 5% and platform revenue growth of 3% over the same quarter of last year. Receivable growth this quarter was led by dental and veterinary specialties. Regarding the new agreement, the agreement with Rite Aid will extend the facility of our CareCredit card to nearly 4600 Rite Aid stores nationwide and the agreement with Premier Dental Holdings which has nearly 200 clinics with nearly 1 million consumers in the western part of the U.S. will result in the origination and the acceptance of CareCredit card in their offices. Plans are in place to launch CareCredit, native application in the fourth quarter, which will feature the CareCredit digital card and be available to cardholders via the Apple and Google Play app stores. In summary, each platform delivered solid growth and continue to make progress in the signing of new partnership and the extension of existing programs while continuing to drive organic growth. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I\u2019ll start on slide six of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $574 million net income which translates to $0.69 per diluted share in quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 12%, receivables up 12% and platform revenue up 9%. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we have generated across the business. We continue to see evidence of the value proposition on our cards are resonating with consumers. Purchase volume per active account was up 8% compared to last year and the average balance per account increased as well. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition last quarter. So that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year. Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year. Interest income was up 9%, which is in line with our average receivables growth. RSAs were up $30 million or 4% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.6% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than 4.8% we reported in the third quarter last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA a percentage of average receivable as well as higher loyalty costs that are directly shared through the RSA with our retailers. For the year, we would expect RSAs as a percentage of receivables to be in the 4.5% range consistent with the prior two years. The provision increased $27 million or 4% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth, partly offset by the improvement in asset quality. Improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30 plus delinquencies, which improved 24 basis points versus last year to 4.02% and in the net charge-off rate, which fell to 4.02%, 3 basis points below last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 15 basis points compared to the third quarter last year to 5.31%. However, measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage remained at 1.27 times virtually the same coverage level as the prior three quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable. Other income decreased $12 million versus last year, primarily driven by higher loyalty and rewards costs, partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $34 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $38 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense run back to our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $61 million were down $7 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $115 million versus the third quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build, the majority of the increase was driven by three items. First, we continued to make investments to support ongoing growth across all of our platforms. Second, we had expenses associated with the rollout of EMV cards for active Dual Card holders. The rollout was completed this quarter ahead of the October liability shift dates. Lastly, we continued to make strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34.2% and 33.3% year to date, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, we had strong topline growth that drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.9%. I will move to slide seven and go through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income growth was strong at 8%. Interest and fees on loan receivables was up 8%, partially offset by higher interest expense, driven by growth and the additional liquidity we're carrying on the balance sheet compared to last year. The net interest margin declined to 15.97%, which was fairly consistent with prior quarters and better than the outlook we provided back in January. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, 77 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquid assets on the balance sheet to $15.3 billion, which is up $1.2 billion versus last year. We have the cash invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the fed, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets. The yield on our receivables is down 33 basis points compared to last year. This was a result of slightly higher payment rates and the impact of portfolio mix, given the strong growth in promotional balances on our payment solutions platform. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%, up 9 basis points compared to last year. This was in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I will walk you through a breakdown by funding source. First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable at 1.6%, the same level as the third quarter last year. Our deposit base increased nearly $8 billion, or 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 63% of our funding, which is in line with the target we set between 60% and 70%. Securitization funding costs were relatively flat at 1.6%. Our other debt costs increased 53 basis points to 2.9%, due to the higher mix of bank term loans and unsecured bonds compared to last year. While the third quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margins and expect them to decline slightly due to the seasonal build up in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year. Next, I will cover our key credit trends on slide eight. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.02%, down 24 basis points versus last year. 90 plus delinquencies were 1.73%, down 12 basis points. We continued to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year. The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.02%, down 3 basis points versus last year. And lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.31%, which was down 15 basis points from the prior year. If you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months charge-offs, we're currently at 1.27 times coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. And as I noted earlier, this is very consistent with prior quarters. Looking to the fourth quarter, we typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and the decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables due to holiday spending in the seasonal build on receivables. So overall, we continued to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we are seeing. Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line and we're delivering on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we are at 33.3%. Expenses came at $843 million for the quarter and compared to last year, largely driven by separation-related costs and growth of the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we also had approximately $20 million in expenses related to the EMV card rollout this quarter. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $29 million as we've added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of new business. Professional fees were up $13 million due to both, separation-related costs and growth. Marketing and business development costs were flat, as we had increases driven by investments in the growth of our retail programs, as well as marketing associated with our direct deposit products. These increases were offset by lower spend on brand advertising. Information processing was up $30 million, driven by higher IT investments and in the increase in transactions and purchase line compared to last year. Other increased $43 million versus prior year, primarily driven by growth in the infrastructure build. As we noted last quarter, the costs associated with the infrastructure build are now largely reflected in our run rate and total expenses remain in line with our expectations. We expect to finish the year within our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continued to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by nearly $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 63% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we now move further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later next year such as checking and online bill pay. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion to $15 billion range, which is approximately 21% of our funding. We did issue $600 million in securitization bonds in September with three and five-year maturities. This is consistent with our approach to maintain this source of funding at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. We also issued $1 billion in tenure fixed rate senior unsecured notes in July. As we\u2019ve said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility, as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down during the quarter, making a $500 million prepayment in August. Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $4.7 billion today and expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility. Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 17.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 16.6% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. Total liquidity increased to $21.9 billion and includes $15.3 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 28% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I will close the summary of the quarter on slide 11 and then move again with the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter we exhibited broad-based growth across several key areas making progress on several fronts and continuing the momentum that we have generated over the last several quarters. We continue to win and renew important partnerships as well as opportunities to expand our network and the utility of our cards, and our pipeline of additional opportunities remains strong. Our digital wallet strategy continues to deliver meaningful partnerships with attractive opportunities. Our innovation and adaptability enabled us to be among the first private label issuers to make our cards and their functionality available through Samsung Pay. We are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast growing deposit platform. And finally with the fed approval to become a standalone savings and loan holding company, we look ahead to the next step in this process, the proposed exchange offer. Again, I want to acknowledge all of the hard work that has gone into this process. We are proud of having achieved the important step in our progress towards separation. As I noted earlier, we are restricted in what we can say today, but please stay tuned on this front as additional details on the exchange offer become available. I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on getting the approval from the fed. Just reading through that 17-page order, I didn\u2019t notice any language around CCAR and I understand you\u2019re approved as a savings and loan holding company. Does that mean that CCAR doesn\u2019t apply to you guys? And if yes, what exactly is the process of getting to return capital to shareholders? And also maybe taking liquidity down from the levels that you have it? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Sure. Good morning, Sanjay. It\u2019s Margaret. So I will hand it over to Brian, but I just wanted to just reiterate how important this milestone was for us and getting the separation from GE really is the biggest part of the milestone. Brian is really going to take you through a little bit of learning around CCAR and where we\u2019re going to go forward on that. Brian Doubles : Yes. So Sanjay, you\u2019re absolutely right, there is nothing in the order that specifically subjects us to the CCAR process. And we\u2019ve discussed in the past because we\u2019re savings and loan holding company and not a bank holding company, we\u2019re not technically subject to the CCAR process. So, that\u2019s where we stand as of today. With all that said, it\u2019s still our expectation that we\u2019re going to file a capital plan with the fed. And it\u2019s going to be based on the fed\u2019s CCAR assumptions. So it\u2019s very likely that even though we\u2019re not part of the public process, we are going to follow a very similar process to the upper banks in terms of using the same assumptions, following the same timeline and we think that gives us probably the best chance of success in 2016. So that it\u2019s going to look similar, but you\u2019re not going to see it as part of the formal public process. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And this is part, the liquidity is concerned. And just one follow-up. So does that mean that you would just put through your own assumption -- you would follow the assumptions of CCAR through your own model? Brian Doubles : That\u2019s our indication\u2026 Sanjay Sakhrani : Right. Brian Doubles : \u2026 exactly, so we would\u2026 Sanjay Sakhrani : Yeah. Brian Doubles : We would grab those assumptions when they\u2019re published in February. We will run those through our models. We\u2019d formulate a capital plan. We\u2019d submit that to the fed. It\u2019s just one the part of the public process, that\u2019s our expectation as we say here today. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. Brian Doubles : So that\u2019s capital. You asked about liquidity as well. I think the liquidity is going to be consistent with what we said in the past. I think we feel like we\u2019ve got more than adequate liquidity today. I think we\u2019ve got a couple opportunities to optimize the amount of liquidity that we\u2019re holding. We\u2019ve also got an opportunity I think to look at different ways to invest that excess cash. You\u2019ve seen us do that a little bit all year where we run our internal models, we look at rating agency considerations, regulatory considerations. We look at our maturities coverage. And to the extent that we have, we feel we have some excess liquidity. You\u2019ve seen us use that to prepay the bank term loan. You\u2019re going to continue to see us do that. That\u2019s part of the reason obviously why our net interest margin has trended better than the guidance we provided back in January. But I wouldn\u2019t expect going forward to see a step change in how we manage liquidity. The regulatory considerations are just one piece of the puzzle. We add up all the other considerations, our internal models and that\u2019s where we used to size the amount of liquidity we have. So I think there is some opportunity there, but it\u2019s going to be more around the margin, it\u2019s not going to be a step change from what we\u2019re doing today. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, everyone. And congrats on getting approval. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Nash : I guess for starters, your loan growth is coming well above the 6% to 8% that your outlook had called for. I was wondering maybe can you give us a breakdown, and how much of the growth is coming from actually improved penetration rates versus portfolio wins? And as you look forward clearly the PayPal renews big way from you, but how should we think about your ability to sustain loan growth at or near the current rates? Brian Doubles : Yes, Ryan, most of the loan growth year-to-date has been organic, core organic growth and that\u2019s really tendership, that\u2019s the value props that we\u2019ve launched at Sam's Club and Amazon. And the only portfolio acquisition we\u2019ve done which impacted the results of our year-to-date is BT, which we closed in the second quarter and obviously impact -- continues to impact our results in the third quarter when you look year-over-year. So I think the fundamentals are very strong. As you pointed out, we are ahead of where we thought we would be back in January. We still got the holiday season that\u2019s going to largely determine where we end up for the year, this is the forecast or somewhere between 3% and 4% similar to what we thought last year. So we\u2019re optimistic. And when you break down the components of the growth, the underlying trends are positive too. So we are saying purchase volume for active account was up 8%. When you look at the average balance per active account, that was up 5%. So when you break down the different components, the fundamentals are strong as well. I will turn it over to Margaret to talk about PayPal. Margaret Keane : Yes. So we\u2019re really excited about the PayPal extension. As I have said in the past, we\u2019ve had a really good partnership, a long-term partnership with PayPal since 2004. And I think they were working through their strategy, we\u2019re working through our strategy. We continue to have a really good dialogue through that process. And as a result of some good thinking on both sides, we\u2019ve come together and we will be extending our partnership. So it\u2019s a win for them, a win for us, and we feel pretty excited about being able to keep them. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe if I could just ask one question on the margin. When I think about how it\u2019s trended over the past year or so, it\u2019s obviously come down, but clearly better than expectations had been. And when you think about it, you\u2019ve had call the 30 basis points direct from yields and 70 from the big liquidity belt. But when I think about the comments that you made Brian on the ability to optimize some by investing some of the cash, if we were to assume that yields do continue to come down in the loan book, is there enough deployment for you to do such that you can largely offset a lot of the core pressure on the margin and we can may be see a margin level that\u2019s similar to the performance that you\u2019ve had thus far in 2015 as we look forward? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Ryan, here is the couple of things. Let me just start with one, one of your promises is that loan yield will continue to come down. I think one other things that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date when we look at the loan yields that have come down primarily driven by higher payment rates, which we\u2019re obviously getting a benefit when we look at 30 plus, 90 plus and charge-off performance year-to-date. So to the extent that loss performance kind of levels out from here then we would expect loan yield to level off as well and we might not see that deterioration. So I think that that just one kind of starting point. We\u2019ve also when you look at the loan yield, part of that is also driven by just a really strong growth in payment solutions and we\u2019re putting that volume on as largely promotional financing, so it\u2019s coming on at the lower yield initially. And then as those accounts start to revolve, we expect a little bit of lift there in the yield. On liquidity, I think, there is nothing that we see that is going to result in margins coming down significantly from where they are today. They have performed better year-to-date because we\u2019ve been able to use them, what we view is access to pay down the more expensive performance of financing. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. We still got a big chunk to go on the bank term loan. So I think we still have some opportunity there and then, I think, we\u2019ve got a little bit of opportunity on the -- how that cash is invested. So you\u2019re going to see us continue to optimize that in terms of more specific outlook. So we\u2019re going to give you some guidance on the January call for 2016 and we can be a little more specific then. Ryan Nash : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : And thank you, our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yeah. Thanks. Just a follow-up question on the CCAR process, since you will be opting into that kind of voluntarily not going to the public process, will that impact, asking all in terms of capital returns? Could we expect something potentially in excess of what peers might be asking for? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Mark, I just will be careful that we\u2019re not opting into CCAR. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re filing a capital plan using the CCAR assumptions. And the reason we\u2019re doing that is pretty straightforward. The Fed has the process. They measure all the other banks on and similar banks of our size and we think that our best chance to success is to be measured kind of on the same basis and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it. But I wouldn't view it as opting and we just think that we\u2019re trying to take what we feel is the path here to gives us the best chance to success and I think following the Fed framework and the process that they have allows us to do that. We\u2019re not going to be specific around our capital ask the first time out. What I would tell you though is that, it's more important for us to get a dividend approved, a buyback program approved than it is to go on our first time and swing for the fences. So we\u2019re going to be fairly prudent and I also first time out. And again, we want to have a successful first outing here as opposed to trying to go for something that greater than our peers right out of the case. Mark DeVries : Okay. But is something comparable to your peers given -- particularly given your even stronger capital position, does that feel reasonable and conservative to you? Brian Doubles : Mark, I am just -- I'm not going to give you more than that right now. Mark DeVries : Okay. Brian Doubles : We\u2019re going to get the assumptions in February. We\u2019re going to run them. We\u2019ve got obviously review it with our Board. We got to go through all of our own internal governance processes and then we\u2019re going to submitted to the Fed. So there is a lot -- there is work to do between now and when we actually submit. That just it be premature to give you any kind of indication at this point. Mark DeVries : Okay. Brian Doubles : I will say, obviously, we have a lot of capital when you compares to our peers. The return profiles on our business compares very well to our peers. Those are all real positives for us and we think the long-term capital return presented for this business is significant. Mark DeVries : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more follow-up on PayPal, I think, our sense was that you kind of expecting -- who you expecting that to go away, so the fact you\u2019re able to renew it is when? Am I right that you were expecting kind of a 2% to 3% headwind to loan growth and that going away, and therefore, that not going away could be a big help for your loan growth in 2016? Margaret Keane : Yeah. That\u2019s right. Brian Doubles : Yeah. PayPal was disclosed as $1.5 billion receivable that was expected to go away towards the end of 2016. Mark DeVries : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Now we\u2019ll be retaining it. Mark DeVries : Got it. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : And thank you, our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. You guys talked about two essential wins. I guess that you probably took away from other issuers both Citgo and Guitar Center. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment and kind of what's out there? And how you were able to get those? And what else -- what other areas are you looking at? Margaret Keane : Sure. So I would say that we feel really good about our pipeline and activity in our pipeline. I think we said in the past, we have seen truly dedicated against all three platforms. There is a competitive environment out there. I don't -- we don\u2019t see it being any worse in the private label space than it\u2019s -- or as competitive maybe as the bigger co-brand deal. So, we think that the competition is playing in the right areas. I think for us, we\u2019re winning really on capabilities. I think it\u2019s around some of the investments we've made in terms of mobile and analytics and data that are really helping us to win this partnership. I think having a more focused process in the three platforms has also helped us. And frankly, I think the other thing that\u2019s really been interesting for us is since we separated out, I think we\u2019re actually getting cogged in, which is new to us. So we feel like we're in a really good spot. I think, we said before, we don\u2019t have to win every deal because we grow mostly by organic growth. And so I think it allows us to really be awful on the deals that we do want to get. At the end of the day, the most important thing for us is getting partnerships where we feel like we're bringing value to that partner and then the partners sees that value because that\u2019s really how you make these relationships long term and sticky going forward. So we feel pretty good about the pipeline going forward. Moshe Orenbuch : Just a follow-up, one of your large partners, Sam's did announce they were going to be taking another card brand and can you talk a little bit about how you can kind of defend against that\u2026? Margaret Keane : Yeah. Sure. So it\u2019s really not that unusual for merchants to except another network. As matter of fact, Sam\u2019s had already been accepting Amex on their online portal already. I think for us it\u2019s somewhat of an opportunity because if folks start coming in using their Amex card, we have the opportunity to cross sell our card. And I think the uniqueness of the way the card works in Sam\u2019s, our credit card is the membership card, it becomes one. So it\u2019s really easy for consumers to use or customers to use when they\u2019re in club. And I think the other is we have a fantastic value prop on our Sam\u2019s MasterCard. So we feel --listen, no one likes anyone coming in, right. We look at these things. We have a good discussion. We have a great partnership with Sam\u2019s. We\u2019re very integrated with Sam\u2019s. And in someway this could be an opportunity for us to cross sell. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks, Margaret. Operator : And thank you, our next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Hi. Good morning. I have a question about the implications from the separation on potentially, expenses and kind of what you can do to drive efficiency gains now that you separate from GE and possibly not being part of CCAR process and having greater transparency and kind of what you need to do on the quality of aspects. Is there any opportunity there? Brian Doubles : Yeah. David, I wouldn\u2019t think about a significant opportunity there just related to separation. As we\u2019ve said in the past, the infrastructure build costs are now in the run rate. So when you look at the expenses, when you look at just sequential bill from second quarter to third quarter, it was relatively modest, just driven by growth in EMV and we always see a seasonal increase in the third quarter. But the infrastructure build cost and everything that we\u2019ve built to prepare for separation is reflected in the run rate. And just based on the earlier comments I made, even though we are not technically subject to CCAR, the expectations are going to be similar. They are not going to be exactly the same, but they are going to be similar. And so I think it will be premature to talk about any kind of expense benefit that we expect from this, because we are holding ourselves to the same standards that the fed is holding others too. So we are going to go through a couple rounds here on filing a capital plan and doing liquidity access with the outgoes and maybe there is a longer-term opportunity, but nothing we see in the near-term. David Ho : Okay. That's helpful. And separately, the renewal with PayPal is obviously a big positive. Can you talk about the implications on maybe the RSA and kind of on marketing expenses and have the upfront impact from that renewal as they are coming, similar economics or worse can you expected? And maybe renewals in general, what would you expect there going forward? Brian Doubles : Yeah. All the renewals that we've done private with the exception of PayPal are reflected in our run rate, so that -- you can get some broad comment on renewals. On PayPal specifically, we can\u2019t get into the pricing and the economics. But I can tell you that as Margaret said, we are really excited about extending the relationship with PayPal. We are able to do that, return is very attractive for us. So, we\u2019re going to continue to look to extend these programs. And I think we\u2019re able to do that in a way that\u2019s attractive for us, attractive for PayPal and PayPal customers. And one other things that we are going to do is part of that new relationship is we\u2019re going to upgrade some of the accounts to Dual Cards, a big portion of accounts to Dual Cards, we think that will help us drive growth going forward. So there's a number of things that we changed in the program, but from our perspective all very much aligned with growing the program and we are going to do that at a return that\u2019s attractive for us. David Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Don Fandetti : Yes. Sort of building on the same question, Brian on the Amazon Prime deal, can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s progressing? And then secondarily, clearly there have been some mixed economic data points from your numbers, it looks like things were pretty steady. Can you talk about if you\u2019ve seen any sort of ups and downs in credit or spend trends? Margaret Keane : Maybe I\u2019ll start with where is the consumer spending and where we see the trends and then turn over to the Brian to some of the other points to asked. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the trend continued to indicate the consumer is getting stronger. Brain will talk a little bit about the credit. We see that getting a little bit better. I think gas prices and unemployment are certainly helping the consumer. I think the consumer is still cautious and they are definitely looking for deals and promotions. So I think our value props are really playing very favorably to the consumer. The one area that I\u2019ve mentioned before that continues to be performing well are things related to the home. So things like furniture trends are pretty strong. So we feel pretty good about where the consumer is right now. And I think a combination of our marketing, the data analytics, the building out of our mobile capability is really helping us drive some of those volumes. Don Fandetti : Got it. Brian Doubles : Yes. So the other question you have was around the Amazon. And I think similar to what we\u2019ve said earlier we\u2019re really excited about the 5% value prop for Prime customers. We\u2019re measuring that every day, we\u2019re looking at the new account flow, we\u2019re looking at the purchase volume. Any time you can make a significant change to a value proposition like we did in Amazon, you want to do that in a way we\u2019re kind of soft launching it. You are doing a lot of testing control. So you make sure that it\u2019s delivering the economic performance that we expect and it\u2019s a good customer experience for the Amazon cardholders. And so far it\u2019s performing very much in line with our expectations and we are optimistic that we can do some more marketing around that offer here in the near term. Don Fandetti : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks guys. And somebody down really asked my question but I\u2019ll pursue it little bit more deeply. Obviously, the Amazon value preposition is very compelling. It\u2019s a new program that strikes me as a program that could have a high degree of seasonality given the nature of your partner. Can you just talk about what should we be thinking about in Q4 in terms of potential impact on volume, but more importantly in terms of RSA and provision expense? Margaret Keane : Why don\u2019t I start off? First of all, I think one of the positives of Amazon 5% for Prime customers it's really encouraging everyday spend. So, I think that\u2019s really what the customer, Amazon is really trying to do. They are trying to get that Prime customer to not only buy big ticket items and things like that but growth seasonal and other things. So the 5% really encourages you to go there to that site versus somewhere else. So, we think that\u2019s really great. Our business is a seasonal business, so obviously holiday is a big opportunity for us. We\u2019re heading into that. We think that Amazon 5% is going to be just a fantastic offering and we hope to see some broader offering of that as we go into the holiday season. So, I think overall this is a great offering and one that as Brian said, we are really watching because I think as we get into the holiday season, the key for us is really making sure that consumer is getting everything they need and things are working in a right way and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been soft for both on our site and the Amazon folks on their site to ensure the experience for the customer is very, very good. I don\u2019t know Brain if you\u2026 Brian Doubles : Yeah. I mean in terms of more specific fourth quarter impact, it's really hard to estimate at this point because obviously, we've got to determine and work out with Amazon to what extent and how broad we are going to go with the marketing in the fourth quarter, what the adoption rate is going to look like, what the spends going to look like and this is very fluid. As I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring this thing almost hourly with Amazon. Our teams sit with them and they look at the spending patterns, the types of purchases, the repeat purchases. And then from our perspective, from a credit perspective, we are also looking at the population of transactor versus revolvers and the credit mix and through the door population. So there is just a number of factors that we are looking at and I can tell you so far, it's performing in line with our expectations, but it's a little too early to give any kind of specific forecast. Rick Shane : Okay. Fair enough. Second question, you mentioned in third quarter, $20 million of EMV reissue expense. Can you just help us understand where we are in that process? I\u2019m assuming, you are most of the way through that, but could you just let us know what fourth quarter will look like? Margaret Keane : We are 100% complete with our active Dual Cards being rolled out for EMV. Rick Shane : Great. Thank you, guys. Margaret Keane : Obviously, we will have an ongoing expense as new cards come due but the bulk is just behind us. Rick Shane : Great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Jamie Friedman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Margaret, I think in your opening comments you had discussed that a third of the applications are now coming mobile and online. I guess it's Apple Pay. I was wondering how that helps your business processes. Does it improve the credit quality? Does it improve the data or the speed, if you could talk in that direction that will be helpful? Margaret Keane : Yeah. I think it is two things. Obviously, the speed part is really good. But I think the other is, we are continually looking at ways to ensure that it\u2019s almost like a seamless process. So for instance, if you were to apply through the Amazon card and you are doing that online, it becomes your preferred card in the wallet. So we are continually looking at ways that how do we get to the speed of the answer, get your card and then make it that card of choice if you will. So that helps us in our positioning. The other is as customers and our research shows it, as customers in particular are looking to make bigger purchases by being able to put an online offers out there in terms of discount depending on the promotion or type of thing they are purchasing, the ability for you to apply and buy right online, while you are looking at those items is really a big opportunity for us. So I think that\u2019s another big area of focus for us. And then lastly, I think, as we continue to look at how people are shopping, the mobile channel and online it just become a much bigger part of how people are really looking to purchase. So being -- it\u2019s a combination of thing. It\u2019s really having that application processes really seamless, but then connecting your marketing offers to make that customer really realize, oh, I can get a bigger item or I can get a bigger basket, if I get X card from any of our retailers, because I have credit available to me and that\u2019s really a combination of all the things we are really trying to play out. Jamie Friedman : And I also want to ask about currency or MCX, they\u2019ve seem to be finally make some progress? There has been a couple of trades that have tracked their introductions in the market just this month? I was wondering if you could give us an update as to where you stand with them, I know that you have partnerships in place, but some sort of visibility would be helpful? Margaret Keane : Yeah. We, obviously, we have Samsung and Wal-Mart, who are a big part of our currency. We continue to build out the currency capability and we will launch as soon as they are ready to launch in the Wal-Mart and Samsung organization and some of our other partners as soon as they are ready. So, I think, they are working through some of the functionality and doing some more testing. So, I think, in the near-term you will hear something of that being out in marketplace. Jamie Friedman : Great. Appreciate the update. Operator : And thank you, our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Question on the CareCredit platform, some competitors, some marketplace lenders have been suggesting that they're interested in competing in that space and I just want to get take the opportunity to understand how you feel your penetration has been going, how your progress has been against goals you set out and whether or not you\u2019ve seen any incremental competition coming from these new lenders or not? Margaret Keane : Yeah. I will start-off with, we have an incredible platform with CareCredit and we have enormous penetration in the industry that we are in. So, I think, when you start with that, one of the things that I think is unique in CareCredit, unless you see the dental space as an example. It\u2019s not like you can go on sign-up the Wal-Mart and get a whole bunch of volume, you literally have to go dental office to dental office to dental office across the United States. So to gain traction and build-out that platform from a start-up is extraordinary hard. So we are not really seeing that competition really have any impact on us at this point. Many of the competitors also are doing more of an installment type lending versus revolving lending, and I think one of the unique things that we\u2019ve really been able to build out. First of all, we have incredible brand-name. Our brand, we do market testing is, we see extraordinary rollout of customers who use that products. We are getting 50% of our transactions now repeat purchases. So I went into like that and I use it in the dental office or things like that. I think our example today of partnering with Rite Aid, where we are really looking at how do we increase the utility of the card, because the customers who have that card have a great affinity to it. So we are not really seeing these guys. I know they are out there. We obviously we keep an eye on all our competition, but I think given our experience in the space, we have this business for 25 years, we are now there for 25 years. So I think, we are well ahead of those guys and I think it will take a little time for them even really have any type of kind of impact on us if they even do. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Brian Doubles : And I think, Betsy, you can look at is the purchase volume trends have also been pretty strong year-to-date. In the first quarter purchase volume was 5.6%, second quarter was 8.5%, this quarter was 12.5%, so we are very encouraged by the trend we are seeing around purchase volume as well. Betsy Graseck : Right. I mean, it\u2019s a little bit more expensive channel to run than the other two platforms, is that accurate statement? Margaret Keane : Well, I think, you need infrastructure behind both these platform and payment solution\u2026 Brian Doubles : Yeah. Margaret Keane : \u2026 because you are dealing with thousands of merchants and you need a merchant process behind same in sourcing to work in the right way. So it\u2019s a bigger build-out I would say, and we have been out this for really long-time. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Margaret Keane : So, I think, we have certainly have scale in that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just second thing, one of your major retail partners Wal-Mart obviously this week had an Analyst Day with highlight a little bit of lower expectation for spend trajectory, and I wonder if you could comment about that and impact on your business? Margaret Keane : Sure. So, obviously, we saw the same thing. What I would say to you is that, traditionally and we\u2019ve shown trust and earnest. We outperformed the retailer two to three times from an organic growth perspective on our card programs we are always doing better than the retailer. And I would say that our program both with Samsung, Wal-Mart are very strong. We are doing really well. I\u2019d also say to you that this is an always -- when retailers go through challenging times and we\u2019ve been in this business eight years. For sure, we\u2019ve seen people win and lose at different points. This is where our partnership becomes even that more value and this is where I think our unique business model makes a difference. So this is where you have to stick by a partner and our goal is to figure out ways that we can help Wal-Mart even further. So they usually becomes more of an engagement on how cards or how card could help them grow their sales. So, we are watching it, we are not worried. Our performance is very strong. They are great partners. We have great relation. We have 80 people sitting out in that though who all they think about every single day is Wal-Mart and Samsung and that\u2019s their job. Their job is to figure out how to grow sales for our partner and that\u2019s the model that\u2019s tries who we are. So, we feel okay. I think they got a bump road but we will be with them all the way and I think we will help them as they go through that process. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Greg Ketron : All right, Vanessa. We have time for one more question. Operator : And thank you, our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been asked. I thought I would just ask one about the penetration rates. You highlight ongoing organic growth is the primary source of growth. It appears that that\u2019s really the result of improving penetration of your partners. Are you seeing any changes in the case of penetration, or should we just assume some consistency there? Margaret Keane : Well, it varies by partners. So, we have partners where we have very high penetration and then partners we have single-digit penetration. I think the way to think about it is, there are couple of different areas where I think our marketing and the way we are approaching the market is really just helping ourselves. We talked about this repeat purchase concept and CareCredit and Payment Solutions. So, we are doing a lot more marketing in those two platforms around getting customers to use the card again. And that\u2019s a good example because if you went into this business four years ago, five years ago, with a bigger ticket purchase we thought of it as a one-end done. You bought whatever you bought and that was it. And our ability to really get customers to reuse the card, I think is a really big factor and those two platforms. I think on the Retail Card platform, I think probably one of the things that\u2019s really helping us besides the great value prospect we\u2019ve put out there, the [Sam's envelopes] [ph] and Amazon, the once we talked about. Mobiles and online is definitely helping us. We are outpacing the industry. So the industry for online sales year-over-year is about 14%. We\u2019re growing at 21% year-over-year and I think that\u2019s having an impact. And we know for fact through our research is the customer shops both brick-and-mortar and online and mobile that we have a tighter relationship with that customer and they will make more shopping trip and they will have bigger baskets. So I think the more we can connect those dots in making that brick-and-mortar and online digital experience seamless to the consumer, I think we have an opportunity to continue to grow penetration. John Hecht : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And second question is just thinking of your new program ramps, I mean, what\u2019s that -- your BP, Guitar Center, I guess, Citgo, are those fully -- are those in the ramp stage or they kind of fully -- or they have normal run rates at this point in time to help us think about how those might improve in near term? Brian Doubles : BP is obviously in the run rate as of the second quarter and that\u2019s lifting our growth rate. We saw that in the second quarter and the third quarter. The other two are in -- sorry, Guitar Center is in thick of knot end. So you will see a little bit of a ramp there but just I can\u2019t give you the actual size of either one of them but they are smaller in relation to BP. So you just kind of take that into account. John Hecht : Great. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day. Operator : And thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

After we complete the presentation we will open the call up for questions. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As you are aware, the fourth quarter marked a major milestone for our company. We completed the separation from GE through the successful execution of the exchange offer. We're very proud of this significant accomplishment. There are likely several new shareholders on the call today as a result. We welcome you. And several previous owners that may have opted for larger stakes in our company during the time of transition. We thank you for all your support in making this transaction a success and the team looks forward to seeing you this year. We're excited about our future prospects as a focused, standalone company and look forward to reporting our progress to you. We were honored to have our stock added to the S&P 500 index upon consummation of the exchange offer. This is a testament to our strong position among leading financial services companies. During the call today I will first provide a review of the fourth quarter. Brian will then give more details on our financial results and outline our 2016 outlook. Finally, I will conclude with the overview of our strategic priorities. I will begin on slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $547 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Overall strong momentum continued across each of our business platforms driving strong purchase volume, receivables and platform revenue growth for this quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 8% with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Online and mobile sales volume was a key component of our holiday sales. Our online and mobile sales growth steadily accelerated throughout last year with fourth quarter sales growing 23% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends which have been in the 14% to 15% range. We delivered another quarter of strong receivables growth. Loan receivables were up 11% and platform revenue grew 5%. Asset quality strengthened as demonstrated by a 9 basis point decline in our net charge-off rate and an 8 basis point improvement in 30-plus day delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, with the increase being largely driven by investments being made in support of growth initiatives, as well as the infrastructure build associated with our establishment as a standalone company. Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposits increasing $8 billion or 24%, to $43 billion. Deposits now comprise 64% of our funding sources, squarely in line with our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full scale online bank. And we plan on launching new product offerings later this year to growth and further boost the retention of our deposit base. Our balance sheet remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.8% calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18%, of total assets at quarter end. During this time of transition we remained very focused on driving business momentum. During the fourth quarter alone we renewed several key relationships including Dick's Sporting Goods, Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring. We also launched two of our recent wins with Newegg and Stash Hotel Rewards. We're enthusiastic about the prospects for these relationships and our ability to continue delivering significant value to these programs. Driving organic growth remains a key opportunity and we rigorously pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration across all our partnerships. Given the rapid pace of change within the digital payments area, online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business and we're seizing the opportunities that are being presented to us by the swiftly changing environment. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships we're helping to shape the future of how private label cards function in mobile wallets and provide value to our merchants and their consumers across mobile channels. This quarter we launched two mobile applications that leverage innovative technology to provide enhanced functionality across our mobile product suite. Both of these efforts build upon collaboration with our strategic partner, GPShopper, a leader in integrated mobile platforms among retail clients. First we launched the CareCredit mobile application. This app, available on the Apple Store and Google Play, enables millions of CareCredit cardholders convenient access to account servicing options. It includes the ability to locate healthcare providers and help focus merchants which can facilitate the connection across CareCredit's more than 195,000 total merchant locations. The app also features access to a digital card and offers a variety of value added notifications and updates. We already have seen more than 700,000 visits to date. We also launched the CarCareONE mobile app which readily connects millions of CarCareONE cardholders to more than 23,000 automotive related merchants nationwide. Users can quickly and easily access account servicing, a location finder and offers such as special financing on their smartphones. We also launched a pilot with JCPenney to offer their private label credit cards in Apple Pay. We continue to seek ways to increase the utility of our cards and their usage. Mobile applications are one of the ways we can readily connect cardholders and partners. In doing so we improve the experience for the cardholder, help to increase engagement and ultimately drive more purchase volume. Moving to slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 5% over the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing and marketing offers that will resonate with our partners and customers. On the next slide I will discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continued to deliver solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the fourth quarter. Retail Card generated strong performance this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 8% and receivables grew 12%. The addition of BP in the second quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 5%. As you may recall, there was a $46 billion gain on sale of portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewing and extending our programs remain a key priority in this business and our success on this front is a testament to the strength and depth of our partnerships. This quarter we renewed our long-standing relationship with Dick's Sporting Goods, a key partner. With this extension we have nearly 92% of our Retail Card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth. Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9% and receivables grew 12% driving platform revenue growth of 7%. Average active accounts increased 11% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volumes and receivables with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We were very pleased to have extended our long term relationship with Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring this quarter. CareCredit had a solid quarter, purchase volume growth was 9% and receivables grew 7% driving platform revenue growth of 3%. Average active accounts increased 6% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was once again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. In terms of business developments, we announced that Rite Aid is now accepting our CareCredit cards for prescriptions and general merchandise purchases in all 4,600 Rite Aid stores in the United States. CareCredit also announced the expansion of the patient financing agreement with National Vision, one of the largest optical retailers in the U.S. with over 800 locations across 43 states. In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continued to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2016. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I will start on slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter the business earned $547 million in net income which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and platform revenue up 5%. Overall we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2015. The value propositions on our cards continue to resonate with consumers. The business delivered growth in average active accounts as well as increases in purchase volume and the average balance per active account compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter so that helped improve our growth rate year over year. Platform revenue included a $46 million gain on sale of the portfolios in the fourth quarter of last year and excluding the gain platform revenue growth was 7%. Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up $36 million or 5%, compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were slightly under 4.5% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. On a full-year basis RSAs were 4.4% of average receivables in 2015 compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA as a percentage of average receivables as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. The RSA percentage on a full-year basis has been relatively stable, around 4.5% for the past three years. The provision increased $26 million or 3%, compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth partially offset by the improvement in asset quality. The improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30-plus delinquencies which improved 8 basis points versus last year to 4.06% and the net charge-off rate which fell to 4.23%, 9 basis points below last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables is down 16 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year to 5.12%. However, measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3 times. This is consistent with the coverage level over the past four quarters which has been in the 1.2 to 1.3 times range. Overall our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable. Other income decreased $75 million versus last year primarily driven by the $46 million gain on portfolio sales last year, but also higher loyalty and rewards costs partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $27 million driven by continued growth in out of store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through our RSAs so there is a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $62 million were down $5 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $78 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build that is now in the expense run rate, the majority of the increase was driven by growth and strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34% and 33.5% year to date which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall we had strong top-line growth and drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.6%. I will move to slide 7 and go through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 8% driven by loan receivable growth. The net interest margin was 15.73% for the fourth quarter, 13 basis points higher than last year. As we had expected and noted on our third quarter earnings call, the margin experienced a seasonal decline from the third quarter due to the buildup in receivables. However, the margin was about the guidance of 15% to 15.5% we set out back in January. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. While the yield on receivables was relatively stable at 21.2%, we did see a slight improvement in interest-earning asset yields as we carried a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average for the quarter. Cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.8% due to a higher mix of lower cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan facility and the payoff of the GE capital loan which offset the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance. Our deposit base increased by over $8 billion or 24%, year over year. We're pleased with the progress we have made growing our direct deposit platform; deposits are now 64% of our funding versus 56% last year. And while the fourth quarter margin was a little above the range we set up back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall we continue to be pleased with our margin performance which exceeded our guidance for the year. Next I will cover our key credit trends on slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continue to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.06%, down 8 basis points versus last year; 90-plus delinquencies were 1.86%, down 4 basis points. We continue to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year. The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.23%, down 9 basis points versus last year. Lastly the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.12% which was down 16 basis points from the prior year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months charge-offs we're currently at 1.3 times coverage which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve. As I noted earlier, this is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So, overall we continue to feel good about the performance of the portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing. Moving to slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses continue to be in line and we delivered on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Expenses came in at $870 million for the quarter and, compared to last year, are largely driven by separation-related costs, growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $58 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were up $26 million driven primarily by growth. Marketing and business development costs were down $37 million. The decrease was attributable to lower spend on brand advertising and marketing associated with our direct deposit products. As you may recall, last year we did a major brand advertising campaign following our IPO. Also given the strong growth in deposits we're able to dial back some of our deposit-related marketing spend in the quarter. Information processing was up $23 million driven by higher IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. The efficiency ratio was 34% for the quarter as seasonally driven expenses tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The ratio was 33.5% for 2015, in line with our expectation of below 34% for the year. Moving to slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first - one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year we have grown our deposits by over $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 64% of our funding which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we have now moved further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We're also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $13 billion to $15 billion range which is approximately 20% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes totaled 16% of our funding sources. As we have said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the Bank term one facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower-cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down making a $500 million prepayment in early December and we also made a $1 billion prepayment in early January that will be reflected in the first quarter outstanding balance. Since the IPO we have paid down the Bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $3.2 billion currently. And we expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. We also expect to continue issuing unsecured bonds and we issued $1 billion in three-year fixed rate senior unsecured notes in December. Overall we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We will continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 15.9% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 14.5% on a fully phased in basis last year, an increase of 140 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $20.9 billion and includes $14.8 billion in cash and short term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LTR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LTR levels. Overall we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. Next on slide 11 I will recap our 2015 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables our growth of 11% exceeded our outlook range of 6% to 8%. The growth in 2015 was driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth, as well as the addition of BP and other program wins. Net interest margin was 15.8% for the year which is better than the 15% to 15.5% range we provided back in January. We have continued to look for ways to deploy excess liquidity generated from strong deposit growth, taking the opportunity to pay down higher cost funding sources. Our net charge-off rate was slightly better than we expected with net charge-offs improving 18 basis points. We attribute this to our improved credit profile as well as the improving economic environment and likely some benefit from lower gas prices. The efficiency ratio for the year was 33.5% which was in line with our guidance of below 34% for the year. Despite the investment we made to build our standalone infrastructure, our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. We feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect this business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.9% which was at the upper end of our guidance for 2015. So overall we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2015. Moving to our 2016 outlook on slide 12, our macro assumptions for 2016 are consistent with the consensus views on forward rates and unemployment, our framework assumes the Fed tightens 50 basis points this year and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our guidance for receivable growth is in the 7% to 9% range. We expect we will continue to grow sales volume at 2 to 3 times broader retail sales. This guidance doesn't assume any significant new portfolio acquisitions. We believe our margin will be in the 15.5% range this year. If rates do increase during the year we expect our neutral to slightly asset sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income. In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to move towards the higher end of our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2016. We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and will use the proceeds to continue to pay down the bank term loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019. In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving this year and our play not to change or underwriting profile, we believe our net charge-off rate will continue to be relatively stable in the 4.3% to 4.5% range we experienced in 2014 and 2015. And while we expect net charge-offs to be stable, we do not believe the benefit we received in our reserve build in 2015 will repeat and reserve posts in 2016 will be more in line with receivables growth. Moving to the efficiency ratio, we continue to plan on running the business with an efficiency ratio below 34% on a full-year basis in 2016. Our efficiency ratio continued to compare favorably to the industry and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets in the 2.5% to 3% range in 2016, consistent with our guidance for 2015. Before I conclude I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2016. As I have stated in the past, although we're not subject to CCAR, we're planning to follow a very similar process. We will use the Fed's CCAR assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we'll review with our Board and our regulators in early April and hope to hear back from the Fed in June. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, our plans will include both dividends and share buybacks. And with that I will turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I will close with an overview of our key strategic priorities. First, we remain focused on driving growth both organically and through new program wins across our three platforms. We have historically produced organic growth of 2 to 3 times market growth rates and we expect to continue to deliver similar growth. Innovative idea propositions and enhanced functionality and utility for card users are some of the ways in which we will accomplish this. For example, we rolled out several compelling value propositions, innovative programs like these and network expansion such as the one we initiated with Rite Aid for our CareCredit cards help to increase penetration. We also won over 20 new deals last year and the pipeline remains strong. We have a demonstrated track record of success that we plan to continue to leverage this year and beyond as we seek to add new partners and programs with an attractive risk and return profile. Second, we will continue to expand our robust data analytics and technology offerings. We will continue our mobile wallet development for private-label credit cards such as the pilot with JCPenney and Apple Pay. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume at a faster pace than the national growth rate. We're focused on leveraging our leading capabilities as the digital landscape evolves. We're expanding our robust data and analytics capabilities through investments in Big Data technologies and insight tools such as data visualization software. Our partners highly value the insights we bring and the impact it has on their programs. Third, we will continue position our business for long term growth. We will focus on building our Synchrony Bank franchise into a full-scale online bank through the development of a broad product suite to increase loyalty, diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. During 2015 we grew deposits a strong 24%. We will also leverage and explore adjacencies to our core business for growth opportunities such as expanding our small business platform. Fourth, we will continue operating our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong liquidity and capital to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. We intend to maintain earnings growth at attractive returns while demonstrating operating leverage. Finally, we're highly focused on positioning the business to return capital to shareholders. And now that we're fully separated from GE we will look to return capital this year through the establishment of a dividend and share repurchase program subject to Board and regulatory approval. We believe these are the right areas of focus and plan to leverage our prior success to pave the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One was the comment about the capital return that you indicated. Just wanted to clarify that this year you would be expecting to have an ask for not just a dividend but also a buyback. And so just wanted to understand how you are thinking about sizing that. And also if it is a coincident ask or is it a step ask, first ask for the [indiscernible] and then ask for the buyback at different points of time? I just wanted to understand how you are thinking through that. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Betsy. So the way that we're thinking about it and similar to what we have said in the past is we're going to follow - even though we're not technically subject to the CCAR process, we're going to follow a similar process and timeline. So the Fed is going to publish their assumptions here shortly, probably early February, we're going to run those assumptions in our models. We're going to review a capital plan that includes both dividend and share repurchase, we will review with the risk committee, with the Board and then we'll review it with the regulators; we'll probably do that around the April timeframe. And then similar to the other banks, we would expect to hear back and have some clarity around June. So that is how we're thinking about it. So we're optimistic that we can get something done hopefully in the second half of the year. And in terms of the absolute magnitude of the return, we really need to go through the process. So we're just not in a position to be very specific at this point. But as we have said in the past, we're going to be very thoughtful around the first ask. It is more important for us to get a dividend and share repurchase established than it is to be very aggressive the first time out. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay I am just thinking through how a lot of folks have been - when you look at your capital ratio, obviously very, very strong. And you have got peers that are in the 90% payout ratio which is obviously quite high and folks that have been going through this process for several years in a row. That said, a 30% payout ratio also looks relatively light given the very strong capital ratio you have. So I am kind of thinking that those two bookends are bookends and that you might be somewhere in between. Obviously you can't really say given the fact that the rules aren't out yet. But is that a fair way to think about what the bookends would be? Brian Doubles : Yes, I think you have to take a look at the peers and their trajectory over a number of CCAR cycles. And now they are at elevated payout ratios. Longer term we would hope to be kind of in the same ZIP Code, but we're going to start out slower than that. We're going to be thoughtful around the first ask. I think the other thing that you have got to keep in mind as you think about our capital return is we're growing our risk-weighted assets faster than most of the peers set. So if you just assume - let's just take the midpoint of our guidance, 8% RWA growth, we would need to retain roughly 35% of our earnings to support growth and keep the capital ratios flat. So over the long term, anything over a 65% payout ratio would then start to bring our capital ratios down more in line with peers. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I have a couple of questions. Let me start with the first one. Just on the NIM guidance, obviously you guys have done better than your expectations. And it would seem like a lot of the factors kind of work in your favor in terms of some tools you have to enhance the NIM. Is there something we should think about in terms of pressuring the NIM going forward that would lead you to have a little bit of a more moderating outlook? Brian Doubles : Yes, Sanjay, I wouldn't think about it necessarily as a moderating outlook. We put guidance out last year at 15% to 15.5%, we performed a little better than that. I think we were at 15.77% for the year. We said approximately 15.5% for 2016. So this isn't a significant change from our perspective from how we have been trending. In terms of how to think about the margin for 2016, I think there is a few puts and takes. Obviously we will see slight benefits we think from deposit growth and interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, we built in two more kind of rounds of tightening, 50 basis points for the year, we will get a slight benefit from that. But then we also expect to see some slight offsets for growth in promotional balances. We saw that in 2015, payment solutions growth continues to outpace the other platforms and those balances come on initially at a lower yield. And then we did see higher payment rates more broadly across the portfolio in 2015. So we have tried to account for all of that in the guidance of about 15.5% feels right for 2016. Sanjay Sakhrani : And then I guess just in terms of the seasonality, obviously there is like a lot of moving factors affecting your business given you are relatively new, you have got seasonality, the capital return aspect of it. But maybe you could just help us think about ROAs across the quarter and kind of what influences that, because that would just help us kind of tie our EPS throughout the year. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Sanjay. So if you are looking at the ROA and if you are building off of 2015 the one thing to think about is the reserve build which I mentioned earlier on in the call. So we did receive a fairly significant benefit in the reserve built for improved performance, particularly in the first half. So in the first quarter we only posted $19 million of reserves, we posted $47 million in the second quarter. So while we were building reserves we were getting a fairly significant offset in the first half. And given we expect credit to stabilize from here we would expect to see a higher reserve build in the first half of 2016, so more in line with our receivables growth. And so, if you take that back to ROA, we would expect to start the year closer to the midpoint of the range. And then similar to what you saw this year in the second half, it usually ticks up a bit in the third quarter. That is where we hit that seasonal low on charge-offs. And then it typically ticks down a bit in the fourth quarter with the higher marketing spend and the seasonal charge-offs. So that gives you a good way to think about it for the year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay one final question. Just on expenses, obviously you are talking about an efficiency ratio less than 34%. But in the fourth quarter expenses were up a fair amount at 10%. Can you just talk about what is driving such strong growth? And even though you guys have this target of 34% or less than 34%, I mean you did better this year in 2015 and it would seem like you have natural operational efficiencies. So I mean, should we expect that kind of trend to continue? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Sanjay. So as you mentioned, expenses were up 10% compared to the fourth quarter last year. In the quarter we did have $22 million of compensation-related payments that were tied to the exchange offer in the quarter. So, if you adjust for that expenses were up 7%, so more in line with growth. And in the expense growth, the 7% growth was really largely driven by the investments we're making in long term growth of the business as well as active accounts were up, obviously receivables up, etc. As you think about 2016, we gave you very similar guidance on the efficiency ratio of below 34%. Maybe I will just spend a minute describing how we think about it. First, I would say we're very focused on driving productivity and operating leverage across the business. We will continue to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a slew of productivity initiatives. We're driving things like moving more customers to e-statements and off of paper. We're improving the efficiency of our call center and collections teams. We're always trying to simplify and reduce the back office and IT systems. Okay, but then we take those savings and we make investments that we believe are going to drive long term growth of our business. So we're investing in things like mobile, data analytics, CRM. And so, we're very focused on driving operating leverage, but we're not so wed to the efficiency ratio that we're going to stop investing in these long term growth areas. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Don Fandetti : Brian, can you just go a little bit about the day count impact this quarter? Trying to get a sense of what your purchase volume and platform revenue growth rates would have been without it. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Don. So there was an impact from day count in the quarter. If you remember, in 2014 we were on GE's fiscal calendar. So in the fourth quarter of 2014 we had 94 days compared to 92 days this quarter. So this does impact some of the top-line metrics. That is part of the reason why you see purchase volume and platform revenue lagging the receivables growth a bit. If you adjust purchase volume for day count it would move from 8% to 10% growth. And then on platform revenue, this also stands out a bit. If you adjust for the $46 million gain on sale that we had in the fourth quarter last year and the fact that we had two less days this quarter of revenue, it was up 9% which is more in line with receivables growth. Don Fandetti : Okay and, Margaret, obviously investors are more concerned around credit these days in the U.S. But based on your guidance it looks like you are expecting some relative stability. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing and what you think may be the impact sort of energy job losses could be in your portfolio mixed in with lower gas prices? And then lastly, spend at the retailer level? There has been some concern around that. Margaret Keane : Sure. I think, as we have talked in the past, we think in 2014 most of the extra gas dollars that consumers had were really used more towards either savings or paying down some balances which we certainly saw a bit of that. I think as gas prices continue to fall, we hope that some of that now is going to be used towards spending. Haven't really seen that yet, I think it is a little early in the year to kind of see that happen. Overall the consumer is definitely stronger. We see unemployment in a good place and we feel that is going to continue. What I would say on - in terms of portfolio itself and the impact on delinquencies in the oil and gas areas. Obviously we watched that, we're not really seeing too much of a shift there. Our portfolio is pretty much a very big macro look at the overall economy. So we're spread out across the whole entire United States. So we watch those things, but we're not seeing a big impact there. And then lastly, we do have a couple of oil and gas portfolios, but they are 3% more or less of our receivables. So, not a big impact there either. Don Fandetti : Okay and just one last - eCommerce growth looks like it continues to accelerate. Can you talk a little bit about the Amazon Prime partnership and kind of where you are on that? Margaret Keane : Yes, sure. I would say overall the growth came from all of our partners, not obviously just Amazon. We have continued to work really hard at allowing our customers as frictionless a process as they can whether it is on their mobile phone or online. Amazon continues to be a great partner for us. We're working very closely with them on the 5% offer. For those of you who have it, hopefully you saw through the holiday there was a lot more encouragement around marketing around using your 5% off. We're continuing to monitor the results of the 5% off campaign that we're doing working closely with Amazon. But overall obviously they had a great holiday and we were glad to be part of that with the offer that we had. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Just with respect to guidance, you moderately accelerated your expectations for loan growth. You took your range from 6% to 8% to 7% to 9%. And I am wondering can you parse that acceleration for us? Is this penetration in new partners like BP or is it increased penetration in more traditional customers or is it just better spend from the overall customer base? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, John. So when we put at a forecast, similar to what we did last year, we try not to include any new portfolio acquisitions. That is the case this year. So the 7% to 9%, it is right around our average organic growth rate over the past four years. And so, it is up a bit based on how we performed in 2015 from the guidance we gave last January. But it doesn't include any new portfolio acquisitions, it doesn't include any significant changes to the value props on our cards. So if you remember, in 2015 we posted 11% receivables growth, but that did include that BP portfolio acquisition. We didn't build anything like that in this year. And lastly, I would just say we also didn't build any real lift on retail sales. We think they will continue to be in that 2% to 3% kind of range. So that is what we kind of based the forecast on. John Hecht : Okay. And then you guys did have some renewals in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about anything you are seeing in terms of competitive trends in that regard? And then finally, can you remind us are there any major renewals you need to think about coming up this year? Margaret Keane : Sure. So I will start with the renewals we did. First of all, we're thrilled about the renewals we did. I would say the competitive landscape, particularly in the space that we're in, is slightly more competitive. But I don't think it is as competitive as you are seeing in the bigger portfolios that are moving on the co-brand side. I think people, because of the engagement with our partners, I think our competitors are being fairly reasonable there because they know it is really important to have a deal that works in good and bad times because you are really working very closely with that partner. So we continue to work that. I think some of the things that we have been able to build out, our mobile platform, our ability to demonstrate that we can bring in more sales has certainly helped us as we continue to work with our existing partners. So I would say that we feel pretty good about that. And I am sorry, your second question was? John Hecht : Just remind us about any major new renewals-- Margaret Keane : Sure. So 92% of our Retail Card receivables are pretty much locked down to 2019 and beyond. We really don't have any one big one that is coming out before that. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : There has been some concern over your exposure to declining sales at some of your retail partners. Could you discuss how you are thinking about that risk and what is implicit in your 2016 receivables growth outlook for 7% to 9% in terms of expectations that you guys have baked in for how your retail partners' sales perform? Margaret Keane : Sure. Obviously we pay close attention. I think the really positive news for us is when a retailer is having trouble, that is when the credit card program becomes even more important. And what I would say to you, it is extraordinarily important for us. This is where we should shine for our partners because we should be in there talking about how are we going to grow sales, what kind of campaigns should we be doing, how can we help you. And that is where true partnership comes in. So I would start with that. I think when we do our plans for the year we obviously start with what are the retailers saying about their growth and then we look to do 2 to 3 times that. I would say we have been in this business a very long time, we have winners and losers every single year. And the way we set those goals, we're able to usually drive better performance than what the retailer is doing in any given month in terms of their performance because the card becomes an even bigger part of what they are focused on. So we watch it, we're paying attention to it. But again, I would say this is where it is really important for us to show up as a partner to really help them turn things around. Bill Carcache : Okay, that is helpful. I guess just separately following up on the points that you made about the partnership and kind of what is at the heart of that. And I think broadly the sharp contrast that we're seeing in the private label space between I guess on one side a group that does more balance sheet lending and arguably offers more of a commodity service versus at the other end of the spectrum one that has data analytics capabilities and is viewed by retail partners as somebody who can help them drive incremental sales growth. And obviously you guys are in that latter camp. So can you maybe talk a little bit about how your pipeline looks? And how your data analytics capabilities are playing into your discussions with potential partners? I look at like the slide that shows the 2015 performance and your receivables growth outlook then for 2015 versus what you actually came in at. Obviously BP was a part of that. But I kind of just wonder to what degree could we be looking at this potentially at some point in the future and potentially see wins - partnership wins possibly drive a little bit of upside. So, maybe if you could just give a little color on the pipeline. Margaret Keane : Just, sure. So we have said in the past we really like partnerships that allow us to come in and really contribute and add value to the overall partnership, whether that is in the marketing front, the sales front, the data analytics front. What I would say is that every single retailer out there is up against a moderate sales or maybe even mediocre sales environment. So what we really try to do is figure out ways to leverage the tools and things we have to help them accelerate their growth. So when we start with conversations, whether it is an existing portfolio or a new portfolio, it always starts with capabilities. And that is where we're pretty disciplined on the kind of partnerships we want because we think when you are adding value every single day and your partner is seeing that value that you are adding, that is how you are able to keep relationships long term and then price becomes the second discussion. So that is what our job is. Our job every day for our folks out in the field, our folks who manage our partners is to really have one foot in the partner, one foot in Synchrony and really ensure that they are driving sales and helping that partner every single day. That is where analytics, our mobile application, all of this is really helping to keep those relationships and allowing us to extend them. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Brian, I just wanted to follow up on the net interest margin discussion. And could you specify what your intent is with respect to your liquidity portfolio which is a massive amount of your balance sheet particularly relative to peers and how that is going to influence your margin over the course of the year? Brian Doubles : Yes, Eric, what we tried to do - so, I guess I would start by saying I wouldn't expect a step change from how we're managing liquidity today. We run a number of internal scenarios, we look at the applicable regulatory guidance, we look at where we think the rating agencies expect us to operate, we look at our maturities coverage and we use all of those inputs to kind of size the liquidity that we hold. And then in 2015 what you saw us do was use anything that - based on all of those inputs, anything that we felt was truly excess liquidity, we used that to prepay the bank loan and we paid off obviously the GE Capital loan entirely. So we look at our higher cost forms of debt and we say, okay, what could we prepay and hopefully benefit the margin. And we're going to continue to do that. I just don't think - I think the improvement to expect there is going to be more around the margins rather than a step change in 2016. The other thing I would point out is I do think there is probably a longer term opportunity as we get a little more experience with our deposit platform. I mean the other thing you have to remember is we're acquired the deposit platform in January 2013. So we have a relatively limited set of data on the deposit platform. As we start to grow that business and we start to see how the consumer behaves, our deposit customer behaves, that will give us a little more comfort in bringing down the overall liquidity. So I think there is probably a longer term opportunity, I just don't think you are going to see a step change in 2016. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, but just mathematically, to the extent that you continue to pay down the bank facility as you did in January, wouldn't that result in a net benefit to the cost of funds? Brian Doubles : That would result in a net benefit to cost of funds. So as I said earlier, I think you have got some puts and takes as you think about the net interest margin. You have got a benefit from liquidity, a benefit from deposit growth and a slight benefit on interest rates if the Fed continues to tighten. And then I think you have got some offsets on growth and promotional balances and then just a generally higher payment rate across the portfolio as consumers continue to get more cautious. So again, we were at 15.77% for the year, we said about 15.5% for 2016 and we have tried to take all of that into account as part of that guidance. Eric Wasserstrom : Great and sorry, just one last question. Your guidance range on ROA is consistent with the prior year, but of course you ended up at 15% at the top end of the range. So does the fact that the guidance range remains the same, is the delta their year on year primarily the expectation about the reserve build? Brian Doubles : Yes. I think that is exactly right. I would just go back to Sanjay's question where what moved us largely to the higher end of the range of 2015 was the benefit we received on the reserve build from the improved performance. If you go back, January - we were sitting at January 2015 I probably guided you to the midpoint of the range. And then the only thing that really played out a lot different than what we thought was margin was a little bit better but really lower reserve build. I think for the year receivables grew 11%, we only built the reserve 8%. So there was an implied benefit that we received in 2015. And now that we think that things are going to stabilize we would expect reserves to grow more in line with growth in 2016. Operator : Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Just want to circle back to online and mobile, because it is clearly the fastest-growing channel of purchasing. I know you referenced - I think purchase volume was up in the low 20%s. Are you able to provide any granularity around how much of AR growth is actually being driven by Amazon specifically and in the mobile and online purchase channels and more broadly? Margaret Keane : Yes. We would not disclose that, particularly Amazon. Here is what I would tell you. The way we have approached mobile is really through the whole process. So we look at applications. So one of the benefits we have is you can apply on your mobile phone and get approved and start shopping. That is a big opportunity for us there. So if you look at just over growth in mobile applications year over here it was 73%. So we're certainly getting much more engagement from the consumers on the mobile phone. And then we go through servicing. Your ability to increase your credit line while you are standing at the store, those are the kinds of things that are really important for us. The last piece is payments which honestly I think all of us are reading. That has turned out to be slower than what people I think thought. We're in all the wallets that we possibly can be in and we'll continue that strategy. I just think this is - mobile and online is the way people are shopping now. We have to just continually work to embed our credit application into the application of the retailer. And that is really a lot of what we're going to be working on in 2016. So our view is this is where the industry is going or the consumer is going and we need to be in the forefront of that. David Scharf : And along those lines, I believe that one of your private label competitors, Alliance Data/World Financial, I believe they have used the metric that around 10% of their credit applications lately have come from mobile. Is there any more specificity around where you may be at that point? Margaret Keane : Well, I can give you the overall just from online and mobile which we kind of calculate as the same. And about a third of our - a little more than a third of our applications are coming in that way. David Scharf : Okay. And then lastly, Margaret, is there anything about the mobile apps, mobile process in terms of the type of data you are able to capture for marketing services purposes? Margaret Keane : Yes, sure. I think this whole data thing connected with mobile and online is really critical, because one of the benefits of our cards is because they run on a closed loop network. We can actually see how the customer is shopping. So we know they made a purchase on their mobile phone or they made a purchase online or they were in the store. And this is information and data we're really trying to pull together to really help our partners think through how they are even marketing to their customers. So, for instance, if we know someone shops multichannel meaning online, mobile and in-store, we have a very loyal customer and someone who tends to shop more often. And their baskets will be bigger and they will make more trips. So we want to make sure we're marketing to customers that way. So if you only use mobile we know that; we will market to you only using mobile or digital kinds of marketing versus someone who is maybe only shopping at the point of sale. So I think as we continue to expand our data analytics this will become, I think, an even more critical aspect of how we help our partners. David Scharf : Yes, it sounds like you are able to capture more and basically provide more differentiated marketing services. And just lastly, as you think about the increased data set you are able to capture through mobile and the opportunities to target more effectively, are any of the retail partners looking for additional type of promotional offers or campaigns? I'm just trying to get a sense whether the shift in channel towards mobile and online is ultimately going to impact the types of marketing services that they are going to look to you to provide. Margaret Keane : We work together with a partner and I'd say it is really a range. You have partners who are fairly sophisticated and see mobile as being a big channel for them and are really - we work with them on the marketing and how we're going out there. I think others are still figuring it out. One of the benefits I think we have been able to bring particularly to our smaller retailers, we partnered with GPShopper. Many of those smaller retailers don't have a mobile application. So just bringing that partnership together and then us embedding our credit application within their mobile app, that is where the partnership piece comes in. We can really take some of the learnings we have from our big retailers, apply to the smaller retailers and help them get their product set, if you will, right on the mobile phone. So, a lot of work going on that. David Scharf : Okay. And then with a third of your credit apps coming through mobile, is there any difference in the acceptance approval rates, the borrower profile that is coming through that channel? Margaret Keane : Yes, there are, there are. Our approval rates on mobile and online are lower than in-store. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just wondering if you could talk about at all how your hopes and aspirations around some external M&A opportunities might be impacting your capital ask. And I know you don't want to size the total capital ask, but is there any guidance you can give us on the proportion of that that may come from the dividend? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So first on M&A, it is really the fourth priority for us. So in terms of our capital priorities organic growth is first and foremost. Dividend would be second, share repurchase third and then M&A fourth. We have a regular process around M&A opportunities. Anything that we would do on the M&A side would be largely capability driven, things that would be easier to buy than to build internally and would help us grow our core business. So don't expect things in other asset lending classes, it won't be too far from the core, it will be more capability driven. And obviously if we have line of sight to something we would build that into the capital plan - the capital planning process. And then just in terms of there is not a whole lot of guidance I can give you on magnitude or dividend, share repurchase split at this point. We need to go through the process which is going to kick off here shortly. The only thing I would point out is if you look at others' dividend payout ratios, they're all kind of in the same ZIP Code. Over time we would expect to be in the same kind of ZIP Code, but there is really not much more that I can give you this point. Mark DeVries : Okay. And when I said M&A I kind of meant it more generically to also include portfolio acquisitions from new partnerships. Is that something that--? Brian Doubles : Absolutely, I actually lump that into organic growth for us. It would be part of that bucket. If we had line of sight to something we would absolutely build that into the capital planning process. And as Margaret said, we have got a very good pipeline in all three of our platforms. I would characterize the deals as small to midsize deals, not the megadeals that are getting a lot of the attention right now. It is kind of the stuff that is core to our business and the stuff that we have done over the last two, three years. Operator : Our final question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Just following up on that last comment, Brian, the new partners that you announced last quarter, Citgo and Guitar Center, have those been in the numbers? Are they coming in during 2016-- Brian Doubles : Guitar Center is in the numbers. Yes, Greg will get back to you on Citgo. Moshe Orenbuch : And just maybe kind of just more high level, as you think about - some of the previous questions talked a little bit about retailers struggling a little bit. Can you talk a little bit how does your relationship with the retailer kind of evolve in that scenario? Margaret Keane : Yes, I would say we have more marketing meetings for sure. So I think we have retailers who have good and bad times. And if you just go back to the crisis, many retailers were struggling and sales were way down. I think this is probably the most important part of our business model that I think sometimes is not really understood which is part of our success of keeping relationships for a very long period of time is you really need to stick by the retailer when they are going through that challenge. And what I would say is we have part meetings, we're looking at ways to help them, we're trying to engage more on their strategy. So I would say even at the more senior levels we're usually talking about, okay, what are you trying to focus on, how can we help you and really drive that kind of engagement. Most of our engagement, particularly at the bigger retailers, are at the CFO/CEO level. So the card program is such an important part of their sales that we usually just have more engagement on what else can we be doing. Brian Doubles : And Moshe, just to come back on the Citgo question. It is in the guidance for 2016, but it is a relatively small portfolio. We think it will come in in the first quarter most likely. Greg Ketron : Okay, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I will begin on Slide 3. First quarter net earnings totaled $582 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17% and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter in line with our expectations. 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.85% and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Expenses were in line with our expectations increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprised 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. And at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range. One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Our balance sheet remained strong, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1% calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cash-back value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefit on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. Cardholders receive 3% cash-back on spending in these types of categories and 1% cash-back on other purchases. We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefit of a cash-back program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called Save Like a Hero which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel\u2019s new Captain America movie. This is the second starter program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You will recall that last quarter we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities. During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000 plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders. This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cash-back program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make everyday, including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com, 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greater savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels. Moving to Slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 13% primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average active account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers. On the next slide, I will discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17% and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month and we launched the new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cash-back program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13% driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishing relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership. We continue to expand card reuse and payment solutions, with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit and purchase volume from repeat usage on the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000x and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter. In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped to improve our growth rate year-over-year. Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower post-holiday related volumes. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I will cover this in more in detail later. Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of our receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last four quarters\u2019 net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past six quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable. Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty and rewards costs were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in our store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels for the remainder of the year. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.8%. I will move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year and the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earned in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility. The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the costs of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff for the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year, we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance. Next, I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continue to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continued to believe their performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months\u2019 charge-offs, we are currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we are seeing. Moving to Slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $41 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third party expense as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped to drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January. Moving to Slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continued to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we have grown our deposits by over $10 billion primarily for our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved further towards the top end of our target leverage, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization of between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loan and senior unsecured notes now total 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan up well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. I would also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the timeline we have communicated on previous calls. Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We have built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I will close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 11 and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we exhibited broad-based growth across key areas, signed and renewed important partnerships and expanded our network in the utility of our cards and continued to develop innovative solutions and value propositions to help drive sales. And our pipeline of additional opportunities remains strong. Our digital channels remain a key component of our overall strategy and we delivered strong growth both online and through our native app. We are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast growing deposit platforms and strong balance sheet. I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Maybe we could start with your expectations for credit, first we did see charge-offs up slightly year-on-year, but yet still down from 2014 levels. And I was wondering is there any change to your call it relatively stable 430 to 450 guidance? And if not \u2013 and if so, how do we think about the trajectory of both provisions and charge-offs over the next few quarters? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure Ryan. So, I think it still feels like we are operating in a pretty stable environment when it comes to credit. We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We have been pretty clear that we don\u2019t expect them to get better from here. I think that\u2019s pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was frankly is better than we expected. We only had a $19 million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So, really what you are seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So, if you look at reserve coverage levels, they are also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So, I think for the balance of the year, we continue to say our losses will be stable, an overall change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe I can ask a question, Margaret, on the outlook for growth, both loan growth and the pipeline for new business wins. Maybe on loan growth, can you talk about how we should think about it from here, how much of the growth is coming from improving penetration rates versus new client wins? You highlighted a couple of times that the year-over-year growth from BP will subside next quarter. So, I just want to think \u2013 understand how to think about loan growth? And then the portfolio pipeline for new deals, can you maybe talk about potential startups and maybe any other portfolio deals that you are looking at? Margaret Keane : Sure. I think we have said in the past that we do have BP in the numbers. So that\u2019s a little bit of the growth. But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration. And throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat and Payment Solutions, we are seeing nice repeat. I think one of the key drivers of our results is really two things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to what Brian saying about the consumer being stable on credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So, having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall, were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you are really seeing the kind of growth you are seeing. So, I would say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It\u2019s really a mix, I would say of startups as well as existing portfolios that we are looking to win. It\u2019s a combination of both. We have, as I said in the past, dedicated resources in all three platforms. We are working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add RiteAid things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning deals and feel we have a good pipeline going forward. Ryan Nash : Just as a very, very quick follow-up, have you disclosed what percentage of overall sales are mobile and online, just I am trying to get a sense for how fast that grew over the next few years? Margaret Keane : Yes, we just do the combined digital, which is the 29%. And again, the bulk of the sales are still in store obviously, because that\u2019s the bulk of where people just continue to shop, but this metric continues to excel. And probably one of the case is when we see a consumer shop multi-channel, we definitely get higher penetration on the cards. So, if they shop in-store and online, for example, we know they are more loyal and intend to stay longer with us. So really working through all those channels is very important. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. You guys provided a lot of the factors with respect to growth in the debt, but I am wondering can you talk about active account growth and average spend level trends and how these compared to recent quarters? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, John. So, I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters primarily around active account growth. So, the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we are always measuring active accounts and that obviously includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us, because we are trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year and then the other half came from an increase in overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So, a lot of what we are doing around the value propositions is getting \u2013 we are getting consumers to use the card more often and they are also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving \u2013 continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we have been trending. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks Brian. And you talked about the RSA and the seasonality and so forth. Is it \u2013 in thinking about the seasonality going forward, should we just think it kind of moves up so it ends up in the range of guidance throughout the year. And the second question with respect to the RSA business, 3-2-1 program at Walmart impact that at all? Brian Doubles : Yes. So let me just take the first one. The RSA would typically be fairly stable in the first half of the year. As I mentioned, just given we had a very small reserve build last year, and when that happens, our partners benefit from that. So if you compare against last year, we had a higher RSA percentage last year than what you saw. The RSA this quarter is actually probably more in line with what you should expect going forward. It\u2019s pretty stable in the second quarter. And then we always see a seasonal increase in the RSA percentage in the third quarter and it comes down a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is typically elevated in the second half of the year. And then your second question on Walmart, you will see \u2013 depending on how that plays out, it\u2019s still very early, but you will see any time we launch a value proposition, you typically see loyalty costs, interchange will increase and there is a partial offset in the RSA for those items. But I would continue to use slightly below 4.5% range for the year that we gave you. John Hecht : Alright. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I know it\u2019s the first quarter, but the NIM is trending better than your guidance, is it fair to say that there is some upside given that trend, similar question for the efficiency ratio, understanding the seasonality, but can we hold kind of the year-over-year increase in that ratio? Brian Doubles : Yes. So let me just take NIM first. It was slightly above the 15.5% outlook due to the fact that we had really strong deposit growth. We did use some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan. So when you look at the average liquidity in the quarter compared to last year, it was a little bit lower. So those are all positives and some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there in our margins. We are always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there would probably be a couple of offsets. One is we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter. And so you will see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year. We had those in June and December. And so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance. So I think there are some put and takes, I wouldn\u2019t think about the margin for the balance of the year trending too significantly in either direction from the 15.76 we reported this quarter. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Efficiency ratio? Brian Doubles : Yes. And then on the efficiency ratio, obviously is very strong in the quarter, 30.4%. it\u2019s definitely going to trend up from here. There is no question. We benefited from having very strong revenue growth in the quarter. We didn\u2019t spend a lot on marketing and strategic investments. Those typically accelerate throughout the balance of the year. I m not going to give you any more specific guidance and we feel really good particularly how we started the year that we will stay below the annual guidance of below 34%. So I think that is \u2013 that\u2019s definitely a good number. We are really pleased with how we started the year, but I am not going to give any more specifics than what we said back in January. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. Just one final question for Margaret, I guess one of the concerns I heard during the quarter and just a follow-up on one of the questions asked before, was that Walmart program and possibly kind of the rising costs to issuers as it relates to enhanced rewards, I mean can you just talk about how you guys think of the that, I understand that it\u2019s a share between the merchants as well, but maybe you could just articulate kind of what you guys are thinking in terms of strategy? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Sure first of all I think we are always looking at ways to enhance value props, right, because the ultimate goal for both us and the partner is to grow the program. And if we grow the program through the sales and receivables, we all win. So that\u2019s kind of a fundamental. Whenever we do a launch like this, obviously we work closely with a partner. And in terms of the overall economics, there is economics in these deals that we can move around and Brian can talk a little more specifically about that if you want. So for us, the more we grow the program and the more we drive loyalty in the cards through those value proposition, the better we are off as well as the partner. We are pretty excited with this particular launch because it\u2019s a program that I think aligns very close to the strategic direction of Walmart, where they really want to drive online sales. So for us, this is a program that is a big launch and one we are excited about, one that I think we can grow the overall program. And when you grow the overall program, we all win. I don\u2019t know Brian, if you would add more on the economics. Brian Doubles : Yes. The only thing, I know you guys get this, but the costs of these value propositions run to the RSA, so the partner is sharing in the costs with us to drive growth in the program. And then the other thing that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but we also set aside marketing and loyalty dollars in the programs and we jointly agreed with the partner on how to spend those dollars. So we can always reallocate from the marketing funds and maybe we will choose to do less one off promotions and shift some dollars into an everyday value prop. I think this is a really good example where we leverage our data analytics capabilities and we look at spending trends and customer insights to really determine the best way to use those marketing dollars to drive growth. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Pardon me, Betsy your line is open, perhaps you are muted. Betsy Graseck : Hi, yes. Sorry, it\u2019s muted. Sorry. Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So a couple of questions, one on the deposit side, you indicated that you have your goals on deposit funding, just wondering how close you believe you are to that and what would keep you from wanting to increase deposits as a percentage of total funding from here? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure Betsy. So we obviously continue to have really strong deposit growth. We are up $10 billion year-over-year or 29%. It\u2019s been fairly consistent over the past few quarters. I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates. We didn\u2019t move our rates, but I think the announcement of a rate hike prompted people to go check what they were earning in traditional savings account. And they decided to move some money around. So we did see a benefit from that in the quarter. In terms of the target range, we are at 69% of our total funding. We gave you a range of between 60% to 70%. So we are at the high end right now. In my earlier comments, I indicated that we are going to continue to grow deposits. We will probably grow deposits faster than we are growing our receivables, at least based on the market conditions that we see right now. So I would expect that deposit percentage to trend a little above 70% in the next few quarters. And then we are always looking at whether or not we should revisit that target and maybe take it up a little bit, but I think we are going to see how the rest of the year plays out before we do anything there. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And I would think your deposit growth is adding low cost funding relative to the other funding mix that you have got, so you are using that to drive incremental loan growth that is potentially a little more competitive. In other words, you are using the cheaper funding cost to drive more loan growth that is maybe a little bit more skewed towards value to your partners, is that fair? Brian Doubles : Well, I think \u2013 if you think about the loan growth we are driving, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. If you just look at the straight receivable yield, it\u2019s pretty flat year-over-year, that was down 21 basis points. And that \u2013 again that\u2019s primarily driven by higher payment rates that we are seeing across the portfolio and then more growth in Payment Solutions. So I wouldn\u2019t attribute really any of it to the competitive environment. If you look at loyalty cost and you really have to look at loyalty costs in conjunction with the RSA and some of the marketing spend. We are going to continue to launch attractive value proposition to drive growth. I wouldn\u2019t think about it direct tie-in with deposits. We are kind of \u2013 we look at them separately. We are trying to fund the balance sheet in a very cost effective way and deposits are very cost effective for us. We are going to continue to drive deposits. And then we are making different decisions when we look at the retail programs and how to drive growth. So, our yields should continue to be pretty stable, but for the two dynamics that I mentioned earlier, really strong growth in Payment Solutions and slightly higher payment rates. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And the just a follow-up on the credit questions that you got earlier, it sounded to me like 1Q result in NCS was more seasonal, I know we saw in the master trust data March improved versus February. So, my takeaway is that seasonality should drive down the NCS as we move into second and third quarter. I don\u2019t know if you would agree with that. And maybe you could speak to the fact that delinquencies have been coming down in the 30-day and 90-day buckets and what the implications are for the forward look from your perspective? Brian Doubles : Yes. If you remember back in January, we tried to be pretty clear that we didn\u2019t expect the favorability we saw kind of in the first half of 2015 to continue when we gave you how to think about the provision. And if you look at \u2013 so, if you look at the net charge-offs in the quarter, I just go back in the first quarter of 2014, net charge-offs were 4.86%. In the first quarter of 2015, they were 4.53% and we are at 4.7% this quarter, so smacked out in the middle of that range that we gave you back in January. So, I think that was pretty good guidance and we came in right in line with our expectations and that\u2019s why we gave you a range for the year. We said credit will be stable, but it will be stable to like a 2-year range in that 4.3% to 4.5% kind of level. And reserves will grow in line with receivables and that\u2019s absolutely what we saw this quarter and you are seeing very stable reserve coverage metrics. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Brian, you talked about the breakdown of kind of existing accounts versus kind of new accounts in the spending. I guess maybe to be a little bit more basic, the 17% obviously benefited this quarter by the leap year and there might have been some funky things a year ago. What do you think the underlying actual growth rate is and maybe talk a little bit about your share at retailers and how that\u2019s moving? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So, if you adjust for day count, purchase volume will move from 17% to 15% growth. Year-over-year, platform revenue will move from 13% to 12%. So, that\u2019s the impact I think even adjusting for day count, we had really strong growth in the quarter. The purchase volume per average active was up, so consumer spending more average balance per active account was up as well. So, we are still seeing good revolve on the accounts. Overall, very positive trends. I think the thing to think about as you try and figure out the back half of the year starting in the second quarter, the comps will get a little bit tougher for us. We have got the BP portfolio, Guitar Center we also had the Amazon 5% value prop. So, you got to factor those in as you think about the second half of the year, but we are really pleased with how we started. We didn\u2019t get a ton of help from retail sales. They were pretty much more the same, more of what we have been seeing. So, we are definitely taking share. We are definitely outperforming. If you look at the total credit card balances over the past 5 years, it\u2019s about $900 billion of balances and they have been growing it about 3%. Our growth over that same time period is 9%. And so there is no question that we are taking share in the market. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And you had mentioned Citgo, are there other programs that are going to be kind of ramping in the second half? Brian Doubles : No, I think that\u2019s the one. And again it\u2019s a relatively modest deal. So, we will have probably a tougher comp from BP and Guitar Center. Citgo won\u2019t totally offset that. So, the comp will get tougher, but the core organic growth is really strong and we obviously hope to have some more program wins in the back half of the year and we will announce those when we get them done. Moshe Orenbuch : Maybe from a big picture perspective, you talked a little bit about the Walmart program and the sharing of the RSA, so maybe you just talk philosophically about that kind of a relationship versus program relationship with how it might be different in addition to just the shares in RSA? Margaret Keane : Yes, I think probably the key thing or the difference between the co-brand and the pure like Walmart example is really the engagement that you really get at the top. And I think in all of our big programs, the most important thing is for us to really connect with the strategy that, that particular retailer or partner is really trying to drive. And so the engagement both from an analytics and marketing perspective is just so high. You don\u2019t necessarily always get that same connection when you are doing the co-brand. So, I think that makes a big difference. I think the other thing that all retailers are really facing is how do they reach out to their target markets. And I think the fact that we had this 29% online growth overall year-over-year is certainly a way for us to really continue to connect with the partners, because the reality is consumers are shopping differently. So, I think really be engaged at the strategy level with the retailer is probably one of the, I think bigger differences between what we are doing on that side versus generic co-brand. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question, Brian, on the seasonality that you talked about on Slide 8. So, it looks like the allowance, the reserve rate is essentially peaks in the first quarter and we saw that in \u201815 and then it kind of gradually decreases again before peaking in the first quarter of the next year. And as we have been looking at year-over-year trends that reserve rate has actually been following every single one of the periods that are shown here. And similarly first quarter \u201816 fell over first quarter \u201815. But at some point, should we expect the year-over-year to reflect an increase similar to kind of what the charge-off rates up above. We had been seeing year-over-year declines. Now this quarter we saw year-over-year increase. So, when should we for modeling purposes expect that to happen for the reserve rate as well? Brian Doubles : Yes. Well, if you go back to what we said in January, we pretty much indicated that we thought the coverage metrics would be stable. So, if you go back and compare against the prior year, we are seeing that stability. So, even though we saw 9 basis points of improvement or I guess the lowering of the reserve coverage from the first quarter \u201815 to the first quarter \u201816, from our perspective that\u2019s like dead stable. That\u2019s very consistent. And so I think you are going to start to see that normalization as you go and compare the prior quarter from the prior year. So, I think you are seeing it now. I would tell you to look at both the reserve coverage as a percent of the receivables as well as look at the reserves as a percent of or against last 12 months in net charge-offs. And if you triangulate those two, we think they will be pretty stable for the balance of the year. Bill Carcache : Great, thanks. And if I may an industry level question for you, Margaret, so there has been, I guess a lot of focus on the friction in the payments ecosystem that certain players like PayPal have created by getting customers to fund their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts effectively disintermediating Visa and MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. And if you extend that thought process part of the Synchrony value proposition to its retail partners is not charging interchange on their private label transactions. And in the sense, one could argue that private label is effectively disintermediating general purpose cards, but there doesn\u2019t \u2013 and of course, we have seen some private label market share gains over the last decade or so, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be as much friction between Synchrony and Visa MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. So, I was hoping maybe you could just speak to the health of your relationship with the payment networks and then maybe also just touch on some of those dynamics. Margaret Keane : Sure. I think we are working very closely with all those guys. I think at the end of the day, how a consumer is going to decide how they make their payment is going to be up to them, right? So, I think the position we have taken is that all of the players that you talked about are really partners of ours, including PayPal by the way, where we offer our credit programs. So for us, it\u2019s really about getting our cards in the wallet, whatever that wallet is, to be top of wallet and to get consumer to use it more. And I think the connection we have with merchants I think is very different than many of the players out there. And I think that\u2019s the value we bring even to some of the partners you talked about, like Visa or MasterCard and PayPal, right? So, we have that very tight connection with the merchant. And so we see this all as upside for us and continue to see that whole payment landscape as an opportunity for us to be in the forefront and continue to invest and we will continue to invest to be leaders in that. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Thanks. Good morning. Just circling back on the credit, Margaret, have we seen some \u2013 within the industry some pressure from merchants, retailers to basically increase the funnel, widen that out a little bit to drive volumes and maybe a little tick up in non-prime credit duration for those customers, down in the lower FICO spectrums, can you remind us how you guys tend to offset this with existing partners or with new RFPs or de novo and are you seeing that pressure to be a little looser on credit? Margaret Keane : We are not seeing that. Our partners are not asking us to go deeper. I think we have been very consistent since the crisis in our underwriting. We have not changed underwriting. Our portfolio has remained fairly consistent since 2011. So I think this is where the goal should be not going necessarily deeper, but ensuring that you are bringing the value and sales in an up way through marketing, through being innovative, through driving channel integration and really working it that way. We control underwriting. It\u2019s something that we feel we have to do when we to our contracts. So that\u2019s something that I think is really important from a safety and soundness perspective from our bank. And we work with the retailers. There is many other ways to grow programs without having to necessarily always dig deeper. And I don\u2019t know Brian, if you had mentioned really how the portfolio... Brian Doubles : Yes. I mean the underwriting profile is very consistent with where it\u2019s been and the average FICO by account is 711, exactly flat to last year. 78% of the new accounts since 2010 our prime credits above 660 FICO. And that\u2019s flat to last year as well. So the overall credit profile continues to be very stable. David Ho : That\u2019s helpful. And separately on Amazon, obviously you have gotten some really nice digital online growth. Now, are you seeing that volume come in as transactors versus revolvers and the reason I ask is obviously it\u2019s a private label program, so you don\u2019t earn any interchange, but you are obviously paying fairly high rewards. So part of that does get offset in the RSA realized, but are you getting the revolved activity that you were expecting in that relationship? Brian Doubles : Yes. When we \u2013 obviously, when we launched that new value proposition, we did a lot of modeling initially because we knew that through the door population and people applying for the accounts was going to change. And so that\u2019s part of the reason why, if you remember, when we launched it, we launched it with a soft launch because we wanted to monitor the mix of consumers and we wanted to make sure that we were sizing lines appropriately, that it was a good experience for the prime customer that we are generating increment sales for Amazon. And so we have a lot of things that we are measuring. But one of the big ones for the credit program was revolver versus transactors. And we have monitored. It\u2019s coming in pretty close to what we forecast. So far, very much in line with our expectations. And obviously, the point you made is a good one which is part of why you see loyalty expense growing a little bit faster than interchange because that\u2019s the program where we do have a very attractive value proposition, but we don\u2019t charge interchange to Amazon. So there is an offset in the RSA. It\u2019s all part of that restructuring of that agreement and part of the extension that we do at Amazon when we launch the new value proposition. David Ho : Sure. And one more follow-up on that if I may, are you seeing a general trend broadly that merchants are more willing to fund a larger portion of the value from the high rewards earned now that they have seen \u2013 that they have gotten some good engagement and account activity? Margaret Keane : I think that varies retailer by retailer, but I think if you take the whole formula of what we do, the retailer is always looking to fund greater loyalty to their brand and their card. And we have retailers who take some of the earnings off the RSA and plough it right back into additional offers. So it varies across. I think the reality is right now everyone is \u2013 Brian mentioned it early, retailer sales have not been necessarily stellar. So our retailers and our partners are really looking to us to work with them to really make sure we are continuing to get right offers out there. But the retailers are high. The more engaged the retailer is, usually the better the program performance is. Brian Doubles : It\u2019s not really a new phenomenon. You have to remember, we did low as 5% off a few years back. I think you are seeing more of this now, but it\u2019s a mix as well. It\u2019s maybe doing a little bit less one-off promotions, doing more on an everyday value prop. Again, this is where we are using our data analytics to really determine what is the best value proposition to get the consumer to come and to spend more. And so we are always looking at optimizing that mix between the one-off promotion and the everyday value prop. David Ho : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : I just wanted to start with a quick follow-up on Amazon, are you any closer now to a harder rollout on that program? Brian Doubles : Mark, we are in full rollout now. That really happened over holiday. The marketing around it is targeted marketing and Amazon controls a lot of that. But the program is performing very well in line with our expectations and we are pleased with the marketing and the advertising around it. Mark DeVries : Okay. Are you seeing volumes accelerate as a result of that? Brian Doubles : We continue to see good volumes on the Amazon program. Obviously, can\u2019t get real specific around it, but we are really excited when we launched it and it\u2019s performing in line with our expectations. Mark DeVries : Okay, great. And I was hoping turning to the Walmart 3-2-1, I was hoping you could comment at least a high level on kind of your level of optimism that, that could really enhance your tender share there because this is a pretty substantial enhancement of the rewards prop relative to the old card, which is pretty modest. We have always \u2013 I am sorry go ahead. Margaret Keane : No, I would say that\u2019s why we are pretty excited. We have been working with Walmart since 1999 and most of the value prop on the card has been kind of more pulsing promotional types of things like $0.05 or $0.10 off gas or something like that or some of the types of offerings. So to get a consistent value prop, that\u2019s \u2013 everyday use is really a big deal, because that\u2019s when the consistency and the usage of the card goes up. And obviously, Walmart is a big retailer, so we are pretty excited about it. Mark DeVries : Yes, fair enough. So given the massive size of them, could you give us some sense of what even just a modest increase in tender share can mean to loan growth? Brian Doubles : Well, it\u2019s hard for us to get specific around an individual program. Mark, you can take a look at what Walmart sales are in the U.S. and you can calculate your own percentage, but its Walmart continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us. Mark DeVries : Okay, great. And then just one last question if I may, given you are only one quarter in, but we had 13% loan growth and guidance is for 7% to 9% receivable growth, does that just feel a little bit conservative here or even if you take away \u2013 you lap the comps on BP, Guitar Center, you are still probably 11% or so, you would have to see a pretty material slowing in growth through the end of the year just to get to the high end of the range and that\u2019s what the backdrop of like some really solid momentum around things like Amazon and Walmart just hoping you could comment on that? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter. We are really pleased with the overall growth. The only thing I would point out is the back half the comps get tougher. If the trends continue, we can be a little bit better. We re really pleased, when we look across the portfolio, all three platforms growing really well, all the underlying dynamics in line or better than what we expected. So we are really pleased with how we started the year. We are not going to update guidance. And I would just remind you that the comps get a little bit tougher. But as you pointed out, the start of the year has been really strong. Mark DeVries : Okay. Thanks. Greg Ketron : Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Don Fandetti : Margaret, you guys have been in a pretty good position in terms of most of your deals being locked up until 2019, when should we start thinking about the risk of early renewals, because if we look at some of the deals that have traded recently, knowing that some of them have been more inter-banked, the ROAs are a lot lower. And so how would you handle that and could retailers come to you and say look, we would like to renew earlier, there is better pricing, could you comment on that? Margaret Keane : Yes. So I think you have to put this in the context of kind of the overall portfolio and how we manage it. And we are always looking to extend relationships. We never let the relationship go to the end of the term before we start having dialogue. In most cases, something comes up like a new value prop launch that\u2019s very significant or they want to roll out a Dual Card or something like that. So I would just say that this is a constant part of how we manage the overall portfolio and we are always engaging with partners to ensure that we renew them before the end of the term. I think we will have to see how the competitive environment plays out. I think this is where we have to do a really good job delivering for our customers and really ensuring that we actually give them no recent RFP and try to engage with them as early as possible. And we have had great success with that over the long-term relationships that we have had. Don Fandetti : Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have. Margaret Keane : Okay. I just want to clarify one point. I mentioned the 29%. I just want to make sure people know. Its online sales were up 29% year-over-year. And if you compare that to what\u2019s happening overall in the industry, that\u2019s about 14% to 15%, so it\u2019s online sales. I don\u2019t want to confuse anyone there, because I might have got misinterpreted, so just want to clarify. Greg Ketron : Yes. Thanks, everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations teams will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day.",

Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Greg. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on slide three. Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. Purchase volume grew 9%, loan receivables grew 11%, and net interest income grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. As per asset quality metrics, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year. And our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources, and know this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%. We plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service, and a continued enhancement of our product suite. One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full scale online bank. Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay-off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Our balance sheet remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5%, and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 70% of total assets at quarter end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved the $0.13 quarterly dividend and has $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions, as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders. Moving to business highlights, we recently renewed several key relationships, including Ashley HomeStores, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals, and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continued to sign partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S. based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio, that already includes recently launched programs with (05:44) and Marvel Entertainment. The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cash back value proposition, where the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. We are excited about these new partnerships as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities and we are pleased to extend our presence in it. We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders. Moving to slide four, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Previously, we had reported platform revenue, but starting with this quarter we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing office. On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on slide five. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results, receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8%, and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based as we serve growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal, and the launch of the new Marvel program. We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in the space, and provide the foundation for the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors, such as travel and entertainment. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16%, and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries, where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley HomeStores and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represented 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter. CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10%, and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals, as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop extent and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11%, and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions on our card, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend, with growth and average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I'll cover in more detail later. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and slightly better than 2Q, 2014 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year, and 4.88% in 2Q 2014. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past two years, with net charge-offs staying lower than the range. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increase 20 basis points to 30 basis points in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter, compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs, as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements and net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year, there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which should not (12:31) repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards costs that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store (12:45) spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now, that we are comparing to periods where the infrastructure build is largely in a run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth, as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was 157-basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating a ROA of 2.4%. I'll move to slide seven and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10% driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth and promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions. The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we make growing our direct deposit platform; deposits are now 71% of our funding versus 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year, and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix, as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus day delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past two years. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year, and 4.88% in 2Q 2014. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past two years. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 months to 15 months of expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year, and we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher over the next four quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017. So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit, and the risk adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $51 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation, as well as growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under the GE TSA. Professional fees were down $2 million, this is primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services mentioned previously, as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million, higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth in purchase volume receivables, were offset by lower marketing costs, related to our deposit platform, as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expenses down $21 million due to benefits from EMV, as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE. The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume related expenses in the second half of the year, as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expected to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January. Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as recap our capital plan. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This put deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit funding. And while we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple of years, such as check-in (20:16) and online bill pay. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, and is now 18% of our funding. In May, we successfully issued $600 million in five-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in May we did issue $500 million and 18-month floating rate notes. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules, and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $21 billion, and includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend, as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We expect to make sure repurchase is subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share payable on August 25 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a summary of the quarter on slide 11, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we again delivered significant growth across key areas of our business. We signed, renewed, and launched a number of important partnerships, and further expanded the breath of business segments we are serving, and our pipeline of additional opportunities remain strong. Our digital channels remain a key component of our overall strategy, and we've delivered strong growth there as well. And to support our growth, we are successfully expanding our deposit base and increasing its importance as a source of our overall funding. Our strong capital position and performance has enabled us to begin to return capital to our shareholders, a goal that we are very pleased to have achieved. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Morning, guys. Thanks very much. First, with respect to credit, obviously, you guys gave us revised guidance a few weeks back, but the quarter reflected fairly strong kind of year-over-year credit trends. Just for, I guess, sort of ratification, when should we see the pace is in sales (24:45) pick up based on what you're seeing in delinquencies and low rate trends at this point? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah John, you cut out in (24:55) room a little bit, but I think your question was around 2Q credit being a little bit better than you expected. Is that right? John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Correct. And then, what pace should we see it start to normalize given the delinquency and low rates? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, sure. So I would disconnect the guidance a little bit from what happened in the quarter. In the quarter, we had a little bit higher recoveries. If you look over the past two year's recoveries, it'd been running in the 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables kind of range. This quarter, they are right around 1.3%, so that drove a bit of the improvement. Going forward and what was included in our guidance is that recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been in the last two years, so somewhere in that 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June, we gave you kind of what we think we're going to close the year at for 2016 at around 4.5%, and then starting kind of incrementally year-over-year 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2017. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just thinking about net interest margin, obviously there was a little bit of benefit this quarter because of the ratio of liquid assets to receivables. Are you able to kind of further optimize that, or how should we think about the movement there, and what that means to margin in the near-term? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. The net interest margin came in pretty similar to where we were in the first quarter. At that point, we had paid down the bank term loan, so we were able to optimize liquidity a bit, and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that, and we thought jumping off in the first quarter the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which was right around, I think 15.75%. We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much. If you look at the year-over-year we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash and the treasuries. But then there is some, what I would call, modest offsets to those two positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are our promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then our guidance initially back in January included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, and obviously that looks a little bit less likely. So some few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Great. I appreciate the details. Thanks. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Good morning. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe I could start-off with a question on the RSA, Brian. It was down 30 basis points year-over-year, and I think it's around 4% in the first half versus a guide for 4.2% to 4.3%, and that implies the RSA will be roughly in line with the back half of last year, give or take couple of basis points. So I guess, all else equal that would probably \u2013 my math, that implies either provision in the back half of this year that's similar to last year, or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So can you just maybe help us understand, why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half or is it just being conservative on the guidance? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, I think, there is a few things. So if we just \u2013 let's just break down the quarter maybe a little bit on the RSA. The RSA obviously included an offset on the reserve build, that's why you saw it down year-over-year, that's why we revised the guidance on RSAs from round 4.5% to 4.2% to 4.3%. You also have to remember that a lot of things in the P&L got better year-over-year. So we had obviously better revenue, margins were little bit better, efficiency ratio was better as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would have resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year. And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the higher provision. And the one thing, I'm not sure you're taking into account, as you think about the back half of the year, the third quarter is typically the high watermark on the RSA. We've got some seasonality, and if you look back over the past two years you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. So as you think about the back half, you've got to factor that end, but that's all included in the outlook for the 4.2% to 4.3% for the year. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, maybe I could ask a follow up on credit. You talked about losses at 4% or 5%, and then up 20% to 30% be for the four quarters after. Can you maybe just give us a sense of how much the upward bias on losses is actually coming from higher growth, so we've all heard about various banks talk about the impact of seasoning on portfolios, how much is actually coming from lower late stage QR rates that you talked about? And just, we're obviously up this year and next year and I know you don't have a crystal ball of three years. But at what level would you actually expect losses to begin to start leveling off assuming growth levels off? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. I mean, there is a lot of factors here and some of these are obviously cause and effect. In June, our comments indicated that we're expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs. As part of that, we focus specifically around the payment behaviors that we are driving the reserve build in the quarter. Now, we're giving you some broader context on some of the dynamics that we take into account when we build the forecast. And those are things like portfolio mix, like platform, product, program, channel, as well as account maturation or seasoning of vintages, as well as the overall consumer trends. Now, I would say, if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than I think others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent. So I'd say, it's a factor, but it's a not a significant, I think for us is what you're seeing for others out there. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Sure, Ryan. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, Margaret, I was wondering if you can comment on the pipeline of potential portfolio partnership acquisitions. And then can you talk a little bit about on these larger deals, what your competitive advantage is versus your larger peer, and kind of how you approach those types of transactions? Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So I'd say overall our pipeline continues to be robust. I think, I've mentioned in past calls that we have dedicated resources in each of our three platforms, and I think you can tell, by even this quarter we won some nice deals. We feel competitively in the $500 million to $1 billion portfolio size. The competition is pretty reasonable, and we really compete effectively there. When you get to the bigger portfolios, obviously the cost goes, an example of that, it gets much more competitive. I would say, overall on the bigger deals that are out there or people are discussing, I think, we start by competing on our capabilities and the history and the level of experience that we have in the industry, and that's how most of these conversations start. I would say, we generally win on those types of things. We feel that some of the things we've invested in, in the last couple of years, particularly around online and digital mobile are really playing to our advantage. We feel we're further ahead than the competition there. I think the other area that we're continuing to invest in is really the whole data analytics portion of the business, and really leveraging some new technology there. So on a capability point of view, I think, we have a couple of areas where I think we're a little ahead. We are very partner focused. And I think, the key relationships we have today really help reiterate with potential partners how we worked with our partners, and that I think is another advantage. So I think it's overall capabilities, experience and long-term relationships and partnerships that we have. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And on program deals like Cathay Pacific, can you talk a little bit? I mean, on one hand it's very good for your loan growth, but I wonder if that's a slightly more competitive segment, and can you talk a little bit about how you won that deal and the returns relative to private label transactions? Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Co-brand is a little more competitive. But I think we're not \u2013 our strategy is really to look at co-brand and Dual Card opportunities in the business that meet our returns. So Cathay and Fareportal being the other one for this quarter, again, it started out with our capabilities and our partnering experience, and that's really how we won both of those deals. When we look at overall return, every deal that we do, we make sure it's kind of competitive with any overall return for our business, and we look to ensure that we're keeping that return in mind, as we take our new opportunities. I don't know Brian, if you'll add anything on returns. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. The only thing I would say Don is, you're going to see us be pretty selective around co-brand opportunities. We like the space, but we're going to be cautious around it. You're probably not going to see us go after the really big marquee deals, but we're, as Margaret said, we can go in and compete and demonstrate our capabilities and win on that basis, and still earn an attractive return. We're going to go after those deals. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. In past quarters, Margaret, you've had more commentary on the digital channels. I was wondering if you could share some of the metrics that you've had in the past, or at least qualitatively describe some of the trajectory you're seeing there. Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So I'll just say that, the digital channels continue to be important, as more and more consumers are active on the digital channel. Our online sales for the quarter were up 27% versus the second quarter last year. Approximately a third of our applications now occur digitally, and if you go back to 2012 to current, we've received over 11 million mobile applications, and that's growing at about 78% year-over-year. So if you compare us to the industry, I think our growth is much stronger. The industry overall is reporting somewhere around 14% to 15%. And I think this is an area where the question earlier of how we compete, I think this is an area where extraordinarily important for us to ensure we're investing. We have a position with GPShopper. We've been able to leverage that partnership and help our partners, actually get out mobile applications sooner where we're fully integrated into the application. So those are the types of things that I think as industries shift from brick-and-mortar to more online, we just have to be the best-in-class on those types of things. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. And I just want to ask one follow up Greig, about the OpEx seasonality, if you could share some perspective on that. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, sure. This is Brian. I assume (37:13), but if you want to hear from Greig, I can put him on. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Well, I'm sorry (37:15). Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I'm happy to put him on the line as well. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I apologize Brian. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : That's all right. So we obviously delivered, I think a pretty strong efficiency ratio in the first half of the year. What I would tell you this quarter is similar to what I told you last quarter, which is we do expect the efficiency ratio to rise from here in the back half of the year, really for two reasons; we do more marketing and promotions in the second half of the year, particularly around holiday, and so that will drive an increase in the efficiency ratio. And we also have more of our strategic investment spend stacked against the second half of the year as well. So as those investments come in throughout the year, we would expect the ratio to increase, but we'll still be within the annual guidance of below 34% for the year. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you very much. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. I'd love to sort of circle back on the questions related to RSA, and uses as an opportunity, perhaps refine the way we think about this. Brian, I realized you gave guidance and that's really helpful. But I'd love to delve into the mechanics here. When we look at the interest income and fees quarter-over-quarter, those were roughly flat. Provision was up about a $100 million. That would suggest assuming that there is a 50%-50% share on the RSAs that you would expect roughly a $50 million decline in RSA expense. We didn't see that, that wasn't our assumption either. But I'd love to talk through, is it an accrual issue, is it a timing issue, how do we think about this on a dollar basis as opposed to a percentage basis? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Rick, part of the reason why we did give you some guidance on this is, as we recognized that it's very hard for you to model based on the information you have, and part of the reason for that is that, all of our deals are very unique, very customized both in terms of the percentage sharing, as well as the level at which we start to share with the retail partner, and for obvious reasons, we can't provide any visibility around those contractual terms. And our retailers also have seasonality. And so there are number of moving pieces that make it difficult for you to model it and to have that transparency, so we give you a guidance range for the year. What you should be able to see from the quarterly results is that, when things get better we tend to share more, when things get worse we share less with the retail partners, that dynamic whether you're looking at it as a percent of receivables, or a percent of pre-tax earnings excluding RSA, those ratios hold, I would say, fairly consistent, but for the seasonal components that I mentioned. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : So I know that's not particularly helpful in terms of how you're going to model it, but I would just continue to use the guidance that we're giving you. I think that's probably the best way for you guys to get it right. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Just one follow up to that. When we think about the \u2013 let's assume that it's an ROA threshold. Is it on a trailing 12 months basis, or does it true up every quarter in terms of how you accrue it? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : For the most part assume that it stood (40:49) up in the quarter. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Recognizing that you don't give specific EPS guidance, can you speak to your confidence level and your ability to grow earnings in the current credit environment if the current environment holds, and you don't necessarily see further declines in unemployment, but you also don't see increases? It seems to us like your business model enables you to still be able to generate healthy EPS growth in this environment, particularly once you start layering in the upside from capital return, but I think there are some concerns around that, and we'd love to hear your thoughts. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Bill, I think the fundamentals of the business are still very strong, if you, let's just walk down \u2013 we'll walk down the income statement and look at some of the key indicators. Net interest margin is stable to improving. We feel good about the margins, the resiliency of the margins, RSAs act as an offset to other things that are going on in the P&L. We drove fairly significant operating leverage, and I think we're fairly optimistic going forward that we'll be able to continue to do that, particularly given that the infrastructure growth spend, that's all in the run-rate. We're really focused on driving operating leverage going forward. And then we're using some of the savings to invest in the long-term ideas and strategies, and things like mobile and data analytics, but this is a scalable platform, and we should be able to drive that operating leverage going forward. So then you're really left with what is the outlook on credit, and we've given you a view on that as well in terms of what we're seeing. So I'd say, you've got a whole bunch of positives, and then we're going to build reserves based on growth in the business as well as our expectation in net charge-offs, and we'll continue to do that. But I think that, that adds up to a pretty positive outlook, generally, for the business. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. That's really helpful. If I may ask one follow up on credit. Just it looks like you guys are reserved at very healthy levels. And if just looking at yourself \u2013 you guys relative to peers, Capital One, which reported last night is running with reserve coverage of about 12 months in its domestic card segment, while you guys are running, well, north of that, you have less subprime exposure. Can you help us understand why you guys are running with what looks to be relatively higher reserve coverage versus some others? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, obviously, I can't speak to how others reserve, that I can't do, but I can tell you that our reserve is based on our best estimate of the incurred losses that we believe exist in the book at the end of the reporting period. Our models generally look out over a 12-month window. They include our expectations for net charge-offs. We also include qualitative and other factors. And our reserve coverage, we don't book to a specific number of months, but it typically falls in that 13 months to 15 months of expected net charge-offs. So other than that, I mean, there is some really good disclosure in the Q is that, you can look at that kind of talks about the other factors that we build in, but tough for me to compare. I don't really have visibility into what others do. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood. Thank you very much. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. In terms of the platforms, Payment Solutions continues to somewhat grow a bit faster. Is that a function of folks looking for the deferred interest products, or is it more a function of just adding higher number of partners in that over the past year? Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I actually think it's a couple of things. We've had great success in winning more partners there for sure. The second is, we've put a fairly robust marketing strategy in place there to actually get brief (45:08) on the card. So if you went back four years or five years ago in that particular platform, we used to describe it as, you bought the product and you were done. We now, do fairly sophisticated marketing using our analytics to get customers to go back and repurchase, so that's another positive. I think, generally speaking, the other positive is, a lot of the products within Payment Solutions are related to home, and we definitely have seen that trend of home being positive where people are investing back in their homes. So I think, we've seen a positive momentum in that business, really for the last probably 12 months to 15 months, and it's just continuing. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. And I guess, in terms of the \u2013 we're hearing from other issuers of the competitive environment, maybe more so related to the Retail Card side, seems to be increasing a bit over the past three months to six months, it's I guess, no big surprise, but I'm curious as to what you're saying from a competitive standpoint. Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think, it's been the same personally. I think, the players are the same players. You kind of get people come and go within that segment. I don't think it's hypercompetitive. I think, \u2013 listen, you need to ensure that you're building and investing in areas that are really going to help the partners. I think as you read, it's pretty 2% to 3% retail growth. So everyone is looking to try to get that customer back in there. We feel that, we have all the right aspects to compete effectively in the space. We're not going to win every deal, nor would we want to win every deal. So in the context of the overall market and what's available, we feel like we're winning the deals we want to win. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to drill down a little more, Brian, as you commented on operating leverage in the business. I understand your guidance on the efficiency ratio for 2016. But just hoping if you can give us a little bit more to think about the kind of longer-term outlook for the efficiency ratio, and what kind of investments you need to make to continue to sustain growth from the business? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, I would say, generally the level of investment will be fairly consistent with what we've been doing in the past few years. Investing in long-term growth, I guess is not a new concept for us, we've been doing that for quite some time. I think that's why we have the growth rates that we do, and we continue to win and renew our partnerships. What I would tell you is, we're very focused on driving operating leverage, you saw that in the first half of this year. It's a scalable business. I mentioned the infrastructure cost and the run rate earlier. We'll continue to drive operating leverage. But as we get more efficient across the business, we're always running productivity initiatives, and we're looking at moving more customers off of paper statements to online statements. We're improving our call center and collections efficiency metrics. And so we're working on eliminating waste in the backoffice, things like that, and that results in real operating leverage and real productivity. And then in parallel with that, we look at things that we feel like we need to invest in to be very a successful business for the next 10 years to 15 years. And those are things that, some of the things that Margaret talked about, investing in mobile capabilities which is something we've been doing for four years or five years, data analytics, CRM, I mean, this is a rapidly changing industry, and we've got to stay on top of those things. But even after you take those incremental investments into account, we would expect to and we would hope to continue to generate positive operating leverage. That doesn't mean we're going to generate positive operating leverage every quarter. We're not going to pass up a good long-term strategic investment to show a few basis points improvement on the efficiency ratio in any one quarter, but over the long-term, this is a big focus for us and for the management team. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just one clarifying question on the guidance itself. I think you indicated, remain below 34% on the back half. Are you talking about each quarter should remain below 34%, so the full year average probably remains below 33%, or you just saying, you're still sticking with the full year below 34%? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : We're sticking with the full year below 34%. Thanks for the clarification. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But maybe just a follow up on credit, could you talk a little bit about the industry setting, and \u2013 because you've got more, I would say, more issuers also talking about the seasoning of their portfolios. Do you think that this kind of helps or hurts if others are in somewhat similar positions, and can you just talk about how that might affect yours and the industry going forward? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, hard for me to comment on what others are saying. I think the trends are \u2013 and the commentary seems to be fairly consistent, which is I think that the backdrop is still pretty healthy. I think the consumer is still generally healthy. The overall macro environment is pretty strong. With that said, the consumer continues to take on more debt. They continue to take on more leverage, and while it appears to be modest, and it looks like the overall levels are still pretty reasonable and pretty responsible. It's something we're watching carefully, I think others are watching it carefully as well. So our forecast includes that trend. It also includes the other factors that I mentioned, portfolio mix and mix by program and channel and other things. We believe this is going to result in a gradual increase and charge-offs over time. Some of that is seasoning, but as I mentioned earlier, I think seasoning, while everybody has on a vintage similar seasoning patterns, depending on the growth rates and the consistency of the growth rates, you could end up with a very different result depending on the issuer. And so I think, while that is a factor we have certainly considered in our outlook, it gets place maybe less overall (51:50) for us as it does with some others. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just a little bit of, kind of an update in terms of some of the new potential activities on the CareCredit front. Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So CareCredit is a great platform. It's one that we want to grow. So in addition to always signing up and winning new partnerships, which is key, the second area that we're focused on is really the utility of the card. So we're continuing to look at ways, and actually that consumers will have that card are looking to use the card more. So things like our partnership with Rite Aid, and you'll see more of those types of partnerships come out. We have a 50%, we use on that product, which is very high. We're looking at some additional industries that we might want to expand in, as well as, our biggest opportunity really in CareCredit is just getting more of what's in a partner's office. So if you think of dental as an example, it's getting more of those patients who come in to utilize the payment methodology of CareCredit. So we're working on some initiatives around that to really \u2013 similar to retail, increase our penetration in the office, of the card. So lots of activity going on there, lots of great marketing. We feel very positive about that business, and it might be a little kudos (53:24), but it's a growing kudos (53:25). Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I had a follow up to really those questions on the pipeline in ROA. Margaret, as we think about the verticals you are targeting, and specifically T&E has been mentioned the last couple of quarters as a priority, you just signed up Cathay. More holistically, as we think about the T&E vertical, airlines, hotels and the like, and other verticals that are in your target area, is the profile or the mix of Dual Card in in-store going to materially change over the next few years? Should we be thinking about the profile changing, particularly as the T&E sector seems to be obviously, almost exclusively (54:33)? Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, we look at \u2013 no, I would say, no. Dual Card is still a very important aspect of our business. We'll, I think generally speaking in our overall portfolio, we always prefer if we can have a private label card and a Dual Card in our retail segment, because it allows us to really grow that portfolio. In terms of the co-brand aspect of our business, we're really trying to take some of the learning set of our retail Dual Card space and leverage that across some of these opportunities on T&E side, and driving value props, and even how you sign up and using mobile and digital as a way to really advance there. As Brian said, we're not looking to be the next big co-brand company, that's not our strategy, but we think opportunistically in a way for us to grow the business is really to look for these other opportunities, and take our capabilities that we have, and leveraging those in some of these new markets. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly, just one more follow up on credit. In the broader topic of curing later stage delinquencies, which was highlighted last month. Has there been any \u2013 is there any either internal change or external regulatory changes regarding call center activity, how active your delinquency management is, and anything on the collection front? And then in addition, can you provide some color whether historically you've sold many charge-offs, and how that mix plays into the recovery factor? Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, sure. So on the first one, I would say, generally we're always making improvements and refinements to our collection strategies. We're fully compliant with the applicable regulatory guidance, whether it's TCPA or whatever it is, and obviously those have some impact on our ability to collect. But I would not highlight them as being overly significant in terms of the overall results. There are things that we adapt to along with the rest of the industry and we make other improvements to work offset to those. In terms of recoveries, I would just reiterate what I said earlier, the overall recovery rate, which includes a combination of what we collect in-house as well as what we sell, it has been pretty consistent. If you look over the past two years, it's been right around 1.1% to 1.2% of average receivables. It's little bit higher this quarter. We think it comes back down into that kind of two-year average going forward. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations : Hey Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : And thank you. Our last question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I have a follow-up question on credit. It sounds now like you guys are talking about more normalization of losses versus some kind of specific stress as it might have sounded like at a recent conference. So maybe you could just talk about how you delineate the line between stress versus normalization. I think that would be really helpful. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So in June our comments indicated that we were expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs over the next 12 months. To us that's normalization. I think, others may have viewed it differently. And as part of that dialogue, we focus more specifically around the payment behaviors that were driving the reserve builds specifically in the quarter, that was the guidance we were providing. Now, I think we're trying to give you some broader context on items in the forecast that obviously influence the forecast, and items that drive some of that payment behavior that we're seeing, that the forecast includes things like portfolio mix by platform, by product, program channel. Well, seasoning is not as big for us, as I mentioned, as I think it may be for some others, that's included in our outlook as well, and we're also factoring the trends that we are seeing on the consumer. And I would just reiterate what I said earlier, that the consumer broadly is still generally healthy. We said all last year that we didn't think the consumer would get better, and they continued to get better all last year, and now we're seeing those improvements subside. But the overall macro-environment is still pretty strong. The thing that we're watching is the thing that I mentioned earlier, that the consumer continues to take on more leverage. It appears to be responsible at this point. The overall levels are reasonable if you look at, I mean, historic context. But it's something that we're watching carefully. And as we mentioned, we're watching what's going on in other asset classes as well, and looking at the layered risks. So our forecast includes that trend continuing, as well as the items I mentioned earlier. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. My follow up Margaret is just on the pipeline. I know you were asked the question, you characterized it as robust. But maybe you could just talk about the probability of something large happening over the near term. I mean, do you feel like that's the possibility? Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'd love to have a big win. As I said earlier, we're going to continue to be disciplined and ensure that whatever we do win is a positive for the overall portfolio. We're competing on our capabilities, and we think in that particular area we're very strong, and we'll play out the opportunities that are out there. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Sanjay. Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations : Hey, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : And thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3, third quarter net earnings totaled 604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued far outpace U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel. Looking at asset quality metrics, 30-plus days delinquencies were 4.26%, compared to 4.02% last year and our net charge off rate was 4.38%, compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses which increased only 2% over the last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year. Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased 9 billion or 23% to 50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service, as well as the build out of our product suite. Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling 16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling 238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth. Organic growth is more significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX companies, our strong performing program and great partnership. Card holders can continue to access loyalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online. We also extended our 17 year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, card holders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg card in their 220 stores. And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America\u2019s largest buying and marketing organization. They work besides thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business and we\u2019re happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group. We\u2019re also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform. We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new cobranded consumer credit program. The program will be offered to Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit card holders with office rewards and exclusive benefits. In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big box specialty retailer of home d\u00e9cor products, to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home card holders will be able to take advantage of commercial and financing office on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits including mobile account servicing. We launched a new program with The Container Store, The Container Store private label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions. We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google\u2019s release of their new Pixel phone. We\u2019re partnered with Google to launch Google Store financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wi-Fi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partnering program. We remain focused on pursuing new profitable opportunities to grow our business. Although, organic growth remains our biggest opportunity and as such we\u2019re working closely with our partners to continue to deliver leading edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth. Moving to Slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter, loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees and on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter we continue to drive growth by delivering value to partners and card holders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers. On the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to generate strong growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad based growth across retail car partner programs continued in the third quarter. As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed two new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long tenure relationships are an important part of our story. We\u2019re able to leverage the expertise we\u2019ve developed over the decades of running this business into a platform that attracts new important partners such as Nissan and Google. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way. We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp, USA to continue providing consumer financing for power sports products distributed by KMC to a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. VP usage continues to be strong across payment solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. In addition to the renewal of the key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with four prominent dental organizations. Extending the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive the reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter. We\u2019re also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the Healthcare provider practice, get a credit decision while they\u2019re there and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11%, and interest and fees on loans up 12%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our card, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend, with growth and average balance per active account up 4%, compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over the last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.38%, compared to 4.02% last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82%, compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later reflects a gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. RSAs were up 34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter, compared to 4.6% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailers sharing and the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvements on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. We expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was at 19 million, driven by continued growth and auto store spending on our dual card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that increased by 23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a remainder the interchange and loyalty expense went back to the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items. Other expenses increased 16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%. I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over the last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We\u2019re also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited to a degree from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth and lower yield in Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15%, compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year. The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased 9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding such as wholesale funding and we're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range, due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall the credit environment remains favorable and we continue to see significant growth opportunities and attractive risk adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past three years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually overtime. Our view takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past three years. The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectation. The reserved bill reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization in net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third party collectors. Part of the increasing credit cost is offset through our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter, compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. Looking to the fourth quarter we typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables. However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past three years. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We\u2019ll provide a full year view on 2017 and conjunction with the outlook we\u2019ll provide in January. So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk adjusted returns for earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at 859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over the last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up 43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. Professional fees were up 12 million; this is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services. Marketing and business development costs were down 23 million, higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform. Information processing was up 10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expenses down 26 million due to reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form lower fraud expense. The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015. We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume related expenses during the holiday season, as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January. Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plan. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall we\u2019re pleased with our ability to attract and retain our depositing customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in three-year fixed rate notes, this is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in August we did issue a total of $750 million in senior unsecured debt, 500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and 200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules, and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to 24 billion, and includes 16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional 7.1 billion in undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock out of 952 million our board authorized for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions in acquired approvals. Overall we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital for growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll close with the summary of the quarter on Slide 11, and then we can begin the Q&A portion of the call. We delivered another quarter of strong operational performance across key areas of our business. We drove strong organic growth and renewed several key partnerships and signed and launched important new partnerships during the quarter and looking ahead, our pipeline remains strong. Supporting our growth is our fast growing online bank, which delivered another quarter of strong deposit generation, further strengthening our overall funding profile. Our capital and liquidity position also remained strong and we were pleased to commence the payment of a dividend and also repurchase shares during the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : And thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great thanks. Brian, your comments about the net interest margin kind of coming back into that level, I guess what struck by is it felt like the seasonal improvement was a little better than - both in yields and the margin a little better than normal. Anything - you mentioned the revolve rate, so does some of that stick as we go forward, I mean how should we think about that over the fourth quarter and into \u201817? Brian Doubles : Yeah, I think most of you think about the fourth quarter typically receivable yields come down just for seasonality. So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you\u2019re building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don\u2019t generate finance for deal in the quarter. So it is really that seasonal trend that is driving the forecast in the fourth quarter, the other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally we have been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range after we saw the strong deposit growth that obviously is continuing and then we are able to improve the yield on liquidity portfolio and also really optimizing amount of liquidity that we are holding. So all those things all else being equal should continue to flow through and we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter, that's why we kind of guided to the - took the guidance up to 15.75% for the year to 15.90% in the fourth quarter which should put you around somewhere around 15.90% for the year. So overall I think we performed very well on our margins relative to what we thought back in January. Moshe Orenbuch : Perfect that sounds great and just as a follow up, similarly just on the operating expenses I mean you had some extra expenses now with FDIC and yet your efficiency ratios still coming in better. It feels like that should continue unless there is other stuff that you would want to call out as we go over the next couple of quarters. Brian Doubles : Yeah, we have been very pleased as well with the efficiency ratio all year really and we are 31% year-to-date, so we are well below the 34% that we indicated back in January. You we are obviously benefitting having very strong revenue growth of 12% year-to-date on the prior year. As you might expect and as we talked about in the past the efficiency ratio will come up in the fourth quarter. And we always spend more in marketing around holiday; we also tend to have more volume related expenses. But due to the strong start of the year in the fourth quarter trend even as we see it, we expect the efficiency ratio will be somewhere around 32% for the full year or so. Significantly better than what we thought back in January. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just hit on the yield again Brian if you don\u2019t mind. I think Moshe mentioned the year-over-year increase in the yield was better for teams even it is for being on seasonality there is some other component to it. Is it late fees maybe and should we expect that to continue as the delinquency rates remain relatively elevated? Brian Doubles : Well I think you always get a little bit more in a revolve in the book when you see a slight uptick in delinquencies, we are seeing that receivable yields were up 13 basis points year over year or so. This is really the first quarter where we have seen that kind of revolve rate and the benefits from the revolve rates poke through the downward pressure we had, just given the really strong growth and payment solutions. So that\u2019s the trend we are talking about all year, payment solutions is growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, roughly 15% growth rates relative to 9 to 10 in care credit and retail card and that was pricing downward pressure on the margins but now we are seeing that high revolve rate kind of poke through and gave us about 13 basis point yield improvement year-over-year. Sanjay Sakhrani : And is there anything more that can happen with the liquidity portfolio because I mean it seems like you can still optimize some on the yield side going forward? Brian Doubles : There is probably a little bit there Sanjay, it is not going to be dramatic, I think we have got really nice job this year, using the excess liquidity from the strong deposit growth to pay down the bank term loan I think we feel good about what we have done year-to-date, we get more yield on the cash and securities that we are holding, but I would say anything additional is going to be pretty modest going forward. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I do have a question on slide 8, specifically the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period and receivables and so clearly the very strong loan growth that we have been seeing has been driving reserve building but in addition to that growth driven building we have had kind of the normalization affect also driving building and so we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance gradually rising to kind of 5.8. That credit normalization effect has also driven some building and so it is kind of as we extend the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarter for modeling purposes, is that kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a six handle and [ph] gradually as we get over the next several quarters until 2017 that that number continues to rise or does that kind of flatten out at some point that where normalization is kind of achieved just trying to get substrate to think about that. Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure Bill. Let me just kind of break down the reserve billed in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember we gave in a range of 5.7 to 5.8 in last quarter, we had a rate of 5.7% and this quarter we came in at 5.82%, so better than expected growth over big chunk of that reserve built in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days we had 2.4 billion receivable. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about 36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis point of coverage. So if you adjust for that the coverage would have been around 5.77%. So right middle of that range that we provided and if you think about it is helpful just to breakdown the reserve build in the quarter a little bit and this is not just to be cleared, this is not how we calculate the reserve but it gives you way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that 2.4 billion on receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7% that gives you built of about 135 million of the 221. Right and then you got the coverage rate increased by 12 basis points which is about 86 million. And if you break that down into two pieces you got the 36 million for the recovery pricing that I have mentioned and then you got about 50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we are seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces on the way to think about it going forward. Bill Carcache : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, thank you. And then as a follow up I was hoping you could share your thoughts on I guess what - maybe just broadly speaking has been some very favorable commentary from a capital perspective on given the Feds decision to eliminate qualitative failures for financials that are not considered GSIFs [ph] and also other changes including RWA growth partial by that termination during, it is really abrasive scenario, that it would seem to certainly significant source of potential upside for any non-GSIFs with significant excess capital and including yourselves just hoping that maybe you could share a little bit on how you guys are thinking about that? Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure Bill. First just a quick reminder of that again we are not fee card bank but obviously we are trying to follow very similar rule that are in place for financial institutions of our sides. Given that new proposals that are out there I think clearly positive development, I think the moment to put in place more reasonable expectations for banks of our size. So we are obviously pleased to see that. I think it is still early to tell how significant the impact maybe, most of the more meaningful proposals I think will be adopted after the 2017 cycle so I have to see kind of what gets finalized but clearly the removable, the qualitative test for smaller financial institutions I think that\u2019s helpful. The treatment of dividends clearly the RWA assumptions those are all helpful but it is really hard to assess an impact until some of these things get finalized but I think it directionally headed the right way for us. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Just two questions one on the recoveries, I just want to make sure I understand what is driving the decision to resource around that and then secondly just had a question you did a analytics activity how much do you feel like you need to invest from here, how much have you invested so far and how much you think you need to invest from here to really get to where you want to be on data analytics and talk a little bit about the revenues that you can generate of the back of it thanks. Brian Doubles : Sure Betsy may I just cover the coverage quickly and then Margaret will do the data analytic. So the recovery assumptions as I just mentioned that were drove about $36 million of the reserve built which is about 5 coverage so in August we saw decline in the pricing we are getting on our recovery so obviously we built that in an assumption in the reserve model and we believe that pricing reflects some impact that is new regulation that are being proposed for third party collectors. The proposal will likely make it a little more difficult, little more expensive to collect and we believe that is influencing the pricing in the market. So as those rules get finalizing, collectors get a better sense of the impact here we may see additional impact on the pricing but as it is right now we put out best estimates based on what we are seeing in the market today. Betsy Graseck : Okay thanks. Margaret Keane : Yeah so on data analytics I take two things, one as we continue to work with more channels we know that we have to really get more sophisticated and real time in our analytics. We don\u2019t really disclose how much we stand but what I can tell you as we are working very hard this year to build out a service sophisticated platform where we are really looking at building out data and CRM capability that goes well beyond just data for growing but also from a productivity perspective and really enhancing the whole win to win experience from our customer from the time they apply for credit all the way through to servicing and we have a pretty big cross functional team working on number of initiatives around data analytics. I believe and I think as our partners continue to look at ways to create more loyalty with our customers this is going to be in an important element of what we can bring to our partners combining that with the digital experience that are customers or starting to go through in really that area is growing exponentially. So it is an important area, with mobile and data analytics together I think these are two big growth levers for us as we look to really help our partners grow with our customer. Betsy Graseck : And it is growth in the form of productivity enhancement for you but also winning new business? Margaret Keane : Yeah, it\u2019s both. It is really using data just the much more smarter at how you are running the entire business from your origination all the way through to servicing and really looking at ways to make that customer experience even more seamless and frictionless using data and then hopefully using the data in a way that allows us to get the next purchase to get a bigger basket to drive that loyalty back in and enhance the experience with our retailers as they go from channel to channel. Betsy Graseck : Okay, awesome thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good morning, guys. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Nash : May be I will start with the RSA loans I think I am sure they came in better and Brian reiterate the guidance of 420 to 430, just what I am looking clearly we are down call it four to twelve year to date and we are down at least 25 bps each quarter so just want to understand if we would end up on the low end of the range you would imply flat year-over-year relative to last year so I just wanted to say what is the specific fourth quarter this year given the factor we reserve built in, in your comments you said that we shouldn\u2019t expect the same seasonal decline I am just trying to understand the puts and takes of how we would get either not only in the range but also just to the bottom of the range on RSA? Brian Doubles : Sure Ryan, I think the one thing that get missed when model RSA, one I think obviously seasonality piece of that but I also think that people tend to view it as an offset to credit in isolation and I think it is obviously includes much more than that and so if you look at your year-over-year I mean just talk about the quarter for the second we had obviously very growth, we had better margins fairly big improvement year-over-year, much better efficiency ratio and at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio we think that carries through to the fourth quarter but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier and so all of those positive dynamics in the business push the RSA higher. Right and then those improvements in the quarter and our expectations going forward there is going to be an offset there for the incremental provision and so I think you got to carry some of the real positives through in the fourth quarter and then obviously those push the RSA higher offset by what we are expecting on provision. Ryan Nash : Got it and maybe I feel in different direction that\u2019s okay maybe we could talk about loan growth it is obviously coming in I take much higher than your guidance from earlier in the year, can you just talk about how much is coming from new customers and how much is coming from increased penetration rates and maybe in retail card can you give us a sense of maybe where you are in penetration across the range of merchants and how much improvement in penetration you are making, where do you think you can get to over time? Brian Doubles : Sure Ryan there is a lot in there so just remind me if I missed something but I think generally we have been very pleased with the growth that we had all year. We have got receivables growth of 11%, we guided early in the year to 7 to 9. So we are obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we have put out there in January. And when you look at the underlying growth drivers they are all pretty strong. You look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balance per active account were up, we really measure as oppose to new accounts, what is really more important measure for us is active account. With private label and dual card you are really trying to move that more towards the top of all that card [ph] and get that usage and get that repeat purchases and so if you look at last two or three years and just compare that to average active account growth in last few quarters were up 7%. That growth has accelerated which is really positive dynamic for us, so I think there is really good evidence, good indicators of consumers are spending more, they are seeing real value in our card, the things we have done around the value propositions. In Amazon, in Wal-Mart, we just announced another one at Guitar Center, those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter that compares to about 15% for the industry, the reuse that we are getting in care credit was up year-over-year 52% versus 50% year ago and we are bringing on new partners. We are bringing on new partners I would say the majority of those are start-up programs; those aren\u2019t really influencing the growth that we had so far year to date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth, it is driving that increased penetration. That is something that obviously tracks by program, it is how we measure our teams, that\u2019s all we focus on that\u2019s the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that\u2019s growing 2% to 3% and that\u2019s been pretty consistent and our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past five years. So I think we feel really good about overall the fundamentals that we are seeing on growth. Did I miss any part of your question? Ryan Nash : No, I think you answered almost thanks, thanks for taking my question. Brian Doubles : Great thanks Ryan. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much, I know there has been lot of discussion but I just want to go back to one item and maybe I didn\u2019t fully understand but as I look at the yield on cards had a I guess about 60 basis point delta sequentially and I am wondering if there is any pricing activity associated with that change. Brian Doubles : No, we haven\u2019t really made any pricing changes, really as the factors that I indicated we got a little more revolved but if you go back and look at prior periods there is always the seasonal increase from the second quarter to the third quarter. it is maybe a little bit more outside this time but that\u2019s really the driver and then we are getting a slight impact from a slight benefit from the increase in the prime rates, you have seen a little bit of that in the quarter as well. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it, it was more than magnitude that was done, that I was curious about and then maybe just looking at purchase volumes, they did decline just a bit sequentially in retail and care credits, any trend to underscore there? Brian Doubles : I don\u2019t think so, there is not always the perfect corollary between purchase volume and receivables you saw that as well in the first quarter when the purchase volume far outpace receivables. And I think as we indicated then this quarter we are comparing against the full quarter of BP and we are also comparing against the Amazon launch of 5% off so those are both factors when you look at purchase volume. I think more importantly receivables grow 11%, given what we are seeing in the mix or revolvers in the book which is great for us, that really drives the majority of our earnings and you are seeing that comparing interesting fees. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yeah. Thanks. Brian you just indicated you are seeing very good response particularly at Amazon and Wal-Mart, but something little bit more specific without identifying one in particular as to what kind of improvement you are seeing in tender share at this point from the enhanced rewards? Brian Doubles : I obviously can't be specific on either program but I would say in both cases they are performing better than our expectations. And I would price modestly better than our expectations only because we really know how to model this, we did 5% off that loans [ph] I think more than five year ago. So we have got really good data in analytics around value propositions particularly really attractive ones like 5% off, 531 in cents [ph] and we know what to expect in terms of transactors, revolvers what we expect to see from tender shift what kind of spend we expect on the card, what kind of payment behaviors and so. We had a pretty good view on what we thought both of those would - how both of those would perform and I would say we are ahead of our expectations on both. Mark DeVries : Okay great and for the online retailers that you have, how many of them have the option like they have got in Amazon where the private level card becomes top of wallet by default and for those that don\u2019t do that there is an opportunity to kind of move into that and really drives better tender share? Margaret Keane : Yeah, that\u2019s definitely is, all of them have the option to do it even retails are not fully online. So to have that check out is really golden and it really comes down to kind of philosophy within the retailer in terms of someone have a choice and others it is just really around getting the prioritization of getting that particular element into their system to get in place. So it is something that we put together what we call our digital mobile, online playbook for retailers and this is something that we talk a lot about. So it is a big opportunity for us as we move forward and continue to work but I would say is on the mobile world in general and online world in general there is a lot higher engagement across all our partners right now in this particular area as they are all really coming to terms of the fact that they have to be best in class. So we are spending a tremendous amount of time and effort, really working with our partners across all three pipelines to really make that happen. Mark DeVries : Okay, thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, wonder if I just get back to the recovery side as it is impacting the allowance forecast in collections. Can you expand a little more specifically on just how the proposed collection rates that are being revised, impact your efforts and whether that is likely to result based on new collection practices and to little more early stage in DQ that doesn\u2019t quite roll in or some of the change practices likely to impact more your latter stage caring efforts but just a little more specificity on its cost centre and other efforts just what has to be quantified? Brian Doubles : Right now these are proposals and these proposals for new regulations around third party collectors. Obviously we sell a portion of our charge off to third parties and we believe that pricing that we are seeing in the market right now is somewhat influenced by these new proposal. So the proposal includes things like more documentation, more work for the third parties to substantiate the debt at the each stages for the collection process, reduce contact other restrictions things like that, additional disclosures and so, lot of these things aren't finalized at this point but I think people are anticipating that at a minimum it is going to be little more difficult, little more expensive based on these new proposals and they are building that into their pricing. So as we started to see that right around in the August time frame, we felt that in the reserve model and that is driving, what I would call relatively modest impact of five basis points on the coverage. David Scharf : Got it and along those lines I know that the two largest debt buyers both public after a couple of years of commenting of elevated pricing and not much supply growth in the US, just a last couple of quarters seems to have been indicating that pricing has been leveling off and so forth. Are you finding that the pricing as a percentage of principal balance that you are able to sell charge offs for are declining or they pretty much holding firm with the historically more elevated prices that you saw earlier in the year. Brian Doubles : Yeah, we did see a decline in the pricing and we think a part of that is driven by this dynamic that I just described on some of these anticipations of some of these new regulations that are coming in. We don\u2019t get obviously complete transparency at the end of the pricing. So this is what we believe at least partly influencing what we are seeing in the market. David Scharf : Got it, very helpful, thank you. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna. James Friedman : Hi. Thanks, I had just two quick questions. Margaret, in the past year you had made some comments about the digital channels, I was wondering if you could help us to quantify those that are even quantitatively like how much is that driver of the growth of the company? And then Brian I was wondering if you could elaborate and you talk about this a bit, but the loyalty payment at 145 million if you look at the new absolute [ph] it is the higher that we have seen and then as a percentage of the purchase volume it was also high so anything that you could share on the trajectory that would be helpful, so one on digital and two on loyalty. Thank you. Margaret Keane : I would say the bulk of sales are still done predominantly in store, but what I would say is that it is definitively shifting and each quarter we see incremental growth on online and digital and as we stated our online sales were up 26% over last year and that continues to grow every single quarter. About a third of our applications occur digitally. We received about 12 million mobile applications since we launched in 2012, that\u2019s grown at about 80% year-over-year so that\u2019s a big growth channel for us that I think you would continue to see expanding. And we are seeing faster growth in the industry so I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners and so one of the things we are really working hard on now obviously we have done [indiscernible] those things we have digital cards on our own. What we are seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps and we are really trying to work to be in that app so that is really seamless and frictionless process for the customers they are shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you are going to see as focusing even more on that retailers come to us and ask to really engage at a much higher level, that\u2019s my point earlier, I think this isn\u2019t a little bit of a shift in terms of how retailers are even thinking about mobiles and putting a lot more efforts there, that\u2019s why we are very highly engaged right now across all three platforms really. James Friedman : Thank you. Brian Doubles : And then on your loyalty question, that\u2019s a trend that we have continued to see all year. We have obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year. We introduced the Sam's Club 5-3-1, Amazon Prime 5%, we have got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proportion at Wal-Mart that three two one, so all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines as you see. Generally more loyalties is a good thing, it means we have grown our receivables; we are generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSAs there is an offset there and if you are looking at just a relationship between royalty and interchange the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than purpose card, given we have significant value propositions like Amazon where we don\u2019t charge interchange but we still offer very attractive value proposition. We would expect to see loyalty increase a percentage of interchange going forward. That\u2019s really we don\u2019t look at those lines and isolation we really measure on kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So it is like if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition and it is going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth that\u2019s a good thing for us, it is a good think for our partners and it really comes down to the shared economic model. James Friedman : Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. With respect to the efficiency improvements that you have seen, maybe you could talk a little bit about the potential for that to continue to go down or you use some of the savings to reinvest in digital and maybe online checking those kinds of things working that operating efficiency actually go to over time. Brian Doubles : Yeah, this has been a very strong year to date performance I mean it is not just a temper expectation, probably not a realistic expectation that we are in a grow revenue in 12% and expense too. So we are very pleased with how we performed year to date. Well obviously we have been given an outlook for 2017, we do the call in January, but I think the important thing is we are very focused on driving operating leverage. This is a scalable business, now that the infrastructure cost are in the run rate, we would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long run. We are always working to get more efficient across the business, we always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online off the paper and we use those savings that we generate there primarily to invest in long terms growth ideas, so things like mobile, data analytics, CRM, but even taking those investments into account, we\u2019d still - our goal would be to continue to generate operating leverage going forward. Arren Cyganovich : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just back to the allowance, you\u2019d mentioned that the seasonality that you typically see in the fourth quarter causes the allowance for loan losses to relative receivables to fall a little bit. It looks like it\u2019s been around 18 and 19 basis points in recent years. Can you give a little bit further kind of pinpoint in terms of how much that reduction will be less during the fourth quarter this year? Brian Doubles : I mean it\u2019s hard to get specific, it will be - we still expect a reduction, so more than zero, but less than 19. And we\u2019re talking about basis points, so it\u2019s a big estimate that we make at the end of the year given the seasonal growth. So I can\u2019t get more specific. We do expect it to come down, but just not quite as much as it has in the last three years. You have to remember, in the last three years, we were in an improving environment, so whatever build we\u2019re recording in the fourth quarter was at least partially offset by improved performance and now it\u2019ll be more reflective of growth and the normalization trends that we\u2019re seeing in the portfolio. Arren Cyganovich : Got it. Okay, thank you. Greg Ketron : We have time for one more question. Operator : Well, thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies John Hecht : Thanks very much guys. Margaret, you\u2019ve given a lot of information about the online, the trends of the business, I\u2019m wondering if you could just - if you get down to the customer level, can you guys highlight any - whether it\u2019s spend trends, borrow trends or credit trends, is there any difference between an online customer and a store based customer? Margaret Keane : No, the online spend and the trends are the same. I\u2019d say, the one area that we continue to ensure we\u2019re focused on is really ensuring the authentication of the customer. So I think that\u2019s where pro-rates might be slightly lower just because you\u2019re dealing with an online channel versus an in-store experience. But that\u2019s a great area where we\u2019re spending a lot of time and investing in new technology to really make sure we\u2019re best in class. So that would be the only I think fundamental difference. John Hecht : Okay, that\u2019s good color, thanks. And then last question, I\u2019m wondering if you could just remind us of your partner maturity profile as we go into 2017? Brian Doubles : Yeah, I think we\u2019ll have that in our investor deck that will come out in a few days. But there\u2019s really - you\u2019ll see from that there\u2019s really nothing material contractually kind of the 2019, 2020 timeframe. John Hecht : Great, thanks guys. Brian Doubles : Yeah, thank you. Greg Ketron : Hey, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results and a 2017 outlook. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $576 million or $0.70 per diluted share. We draw significant broad-based growth in each of our sales platforms, which resulted in double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income for the company. We also grew purchase volume 9% over the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at just our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 20%, far exceeding U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. And our Retail Card online sales penetration reached 25% in the fourth quarter. Looking at asset quality, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our strong revenue growth and expense discipline has yielded robust operating leverage, and put our efficiency ratio at 31.6% for the quarter, approximately 240 basis points lower than last year. Supporting our growth was another quarter of significant deposit generation, which increased $9 billion, or 20%, to $52 billion. Deposits now comprise 72% of our funding source. By focusing on competitive rates and exceptional customer service, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth. The longer term we expect for that growth to trend more in line with our receivables growth. Our balance sheet remain strong with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.2% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion, or 15% of total assets at quarter end. And we were pleased to pay our quarterly common stock dividend payments of $0.13 and repurchased $238 million of our common stock during the quarter. This augments the capital we are deploying through our strong balance sheet growth. And the biggest driver of that growth continues to be organic growth. At the same time, we are pursuing new partnerships and we are pleased to have launched our new Fareportal program during the fourth quarter. The program includes the Dual Card and private label products for their brands. This is the first credit card program from an online travel agency to include a special financing offer to help manage the cost of travel and also includes an enhanced loyalty program. In addition, CareCredit announced a new multi-year agreement with Henry Schein Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Henry Schein, Inc., the world\u2019s largest provider of healthcare products and services, to office-based dental, animal health, and medical practitioners. This strategic alliance will include the integration of CareCredit financing into Henry Schein\u2019s leading practice management software solutions, co-marketing programs and collaboration on prospective value-added services. We are continuously working on the development of solutions to improve functionality, and ease of use for mobile, an increasingly important sales channel. For example, this quarter we launched SyPi, a of fully integrated Synchrony plug-in credit feature for our retailers\u2019 app, which we developed with GPShopper. The plug-in allows credit card holders to easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments on their accounts via their mobile device. Cardholders can view account balances and purchase activity, make payments, and check available credit limits for quick-and-easy purchasing decision, all within the retail\u2019s app. It can be quickly integrated and is fully customizable for the retailer, and easily integrated into their existing app enhancing the mobile shopping experience, increasing customer engagement and boosting loyalty. We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter we introduced Pay My Provider, a secure online payment portal that allows cardholders to pay their outstanding balances with their CareCredit card anytime, anywhere and on any device. It provides cardholders a convenient and secure payment option. Patients can choose from the available financing options and submit a payment directly to the provider using their CareCredit card. We continue to drive strong results this quarter, developing, extending and deepening relationships to drive value for our partners, cardholders and shareholders. Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans also grew 12% over the fourth quarter of last year. We are delivering value to partners and cardholders through attractive value proposition, promotional financing and strategic marketing offers and this is helping to drive strong results. On the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to generate strong growth across all three of our sales platforms as shown in Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter a strong performance. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%. Interest and fees on loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner program continued in the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we have leveraged our expertise to attract new partners in the travel and entertainment space. And we have won several new partners in this segment in 2016. During the fourth quarter we launched an exciting new program with Fareportal. We look forward to deepening these relationships and continuing to attract new partners as we build our business in this attractive segment. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 13% and, average active account growth of 12%. Interest and fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables with home furnishing, automotive products and power leading the way. During the quarter, we announced a new partnership with CFMOTO, to be the exclusive provider of consumer financing for products sold in the U.S. and VP usage continue to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 28% of purchase volume in the fourth quarter. CareCredit delivered another strong quarter as well. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. And we are pleased to have announced the new multi-year agreement with Henry Schein Financial Services, LLC, expanding the network in utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive our reuse rate of 53% of purchase volume in the quarter. 2016 was a year of significant progress. We generated strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms driving solid revenue growth, substantial operating leverage and attractive returns. In addition, we signed several key relationships and expanded our network and card utility, while continuing to innovate valuable digital solutions and expand our analytics capabilities to bring value to our partners and customers. Our direct deposit platform has continued to support our growth, as we have successfully extended this lower-cost funding source. All of this success has contributed to our ability to return capital to shareholders, not only through robust growth, but now also via payment of dividends and through our share repurchase program. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, the business earned $576 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9% and, both receivables and interest in fees on loans up 12%. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2016. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 3% over the last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $253 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year. And the net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% last year. The full-year net charge-off rate was 4.5% in line with the outlook of 4.3% to 4.5% we provided at the beginning of 2016. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.69%. Reserves were in line with the view we provided last quarter. Coverage typically declines in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal build in receivables and coverage came down 13 basis points compared to the third quarter as we expected. The asset quality metrics, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later, are in line with our expectations and reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we highlighted this year. RSAs were up $77 million compared to last year, RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.4% for the quarter, compared to 4.5% last year. The slightly lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which offsets the increase in sharing from the year-over-year revenue growth and lower expense growth. On a full-year basis, the RSA percentage was 4.2%, which was in line with the 4.2% to 4.3% range we had expected. The reserve build in the second quarter of 2016 resulted in the RSA running at a lower level than previous years. Looking forward into 2017, we think the RSAs will move back closer to the 4.4% to 4.5% range, near the levels we had been running at prior to 2016. Other income was essentially flat versus last year. While interchange was up $20 million, driven by continued growth in auto store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that increased by $32 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a remainder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items. Higher debt cancellation fees and other income offset the impact of higher loyalty expense net of interchange. Other expenses increased $48 million or 6% versus last year, driven by growth and bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.6%, significantly lower than last year due to the strong operating leverage we have generated this year. I\u2019ll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter with strong revenue and net earnings growth compared to prior year. I\u2019ll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 13%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.22% for the quarter, up 49 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in earlier in 2016. We\u2019re also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables increased 17 basis points to 21.36%, driven by slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We also realized a modest benefit from the increase in the primary compared to the prior year. Lastly, funding costs improved by 2 basis points driven by improved funding mix. Our deposit base increased by $9 billion and was 72% of our funding sources versus 64% a year ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources. So the margin benefited from the shift in the funding mix to lower cost deposits. The improvements noted above were partially offset by the impact of mix-shift due to continued strong growth and lower yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The plat\u2019s receivables have grown on average 15% compared to retail card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 10% to 11% range over the past year. So overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our outlook for the year. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past two years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.03% compared to 1.86% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% last year. And as I noted earlier, net charge-offs for the year were 4.5%, in line with our outlook for the year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables decreased 13 basis points from the third quarter, to 5.69%, due mainly to the seasonal build in receivables and was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio and the normalization in net charge-offs. In summary, while credit will normalize from here, it\u2019s important to reiterate that we\u2019re still operating in a pretty favorable environment. And the risk adjusted returns we\u2019re earning on the new accounts we\u2019re bringing on are still very attractive. Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $918 million for the quarter, up 6% over the last year driven primarily by growth. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $30 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth in the business. This increase also reflects cost related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. Marketing and business development costs were up slightly, $2 million over the last year. Increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which help drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables was largely offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions which is reflected in loyalty program expense. Information processing was up $5 million or 6% driven by continued IT investments, and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense increased $12 million, primarily driven by growth. The efficiency ratio was 31.6% for the quarter, approximately 240 basis points lower than last year, as the business continue to generate significant positive operating leverage due to the strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily to our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 72% of our funding, significantly higher than the 64% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our CDs in 2016 was 91%, which is up from 88% in the prior year. In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 17% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. While we did not do any issuance in the fourth quarter, we will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and expect this to be 10% to 15% of our funding going forward. So overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.2% CET1 under the transition rules and 17% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 15.9% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity decreased slightly compared to the prior year to $20 billion, and includes $13.6 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional $6.7 billion in undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 22.5% of our total assets. This is down from 24.9% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity as I noted earlier. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock out of 952 million our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to execute our share repurchase plan, subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Next on Slide 11, I\u2019ll recap our 2016 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 12% exceeded our outlook range of 7% to 9%. The growth in 2016 was driven by the strong value props on our cards, and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth. Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs. Net interest margin was 16% for the year, which is better than the 15.5% range we provided back in January. Higher receivables yield, and a more optimal asset and funding mix were the major drivers for the outperformance. Our net charge-off rate of 4.5% was in line with our outlook of 4.3% to 4.5%. We did start to see net charge-offs normalize off the very favorable levels in 2015, and expect this to continue into 2017, which I will discuss in our outlook. The efficiency ratio for the year was 31.1%, well below the 2015 level of 33.5% and our outlook of below 34%. Stronger revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses generated significant operating leverage in 2016. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.7%, which was at the mid-point of our range for 2016. The strong operating leverage we generated due to higher growth, improved net interest margin and expense control more than offset higher provision expense in 2016. So overall, we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2016. Moving to our 2017 outlook on Slide 12, our macro assumptions for 2017 assume the fed tightens 25 basis points late this year, and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our outlook for receivables growth is in the 7% to 9%. We expect to continue to grow sales volume at two to three times broader retail sales. This outlook doesn\u2019t assume any significant new portfolio acquisitions or value propositions, and it\u2019s in line with our organic growth rates in the previous years. We believe our margin will be in the 15.75% to 16% this year. While we expect to realize a modest benefit from the December rate increase, we expect this to be more than offset by the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions. If rates do increase during the year, we expect our slightly asset-sensitive position will provide a small benefit to our net interest income. In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs to further normalize into the 4.75% to 5% range in 2017. Our base plan class for net charge-offs to be just under the midpoint of the range. We have also evaluated scenarios with changes to portfolio mix, consumer trends, payment behaviors and recovery rates. And if they were to trend somewhat differently than we have planned, this would bring net charge-offs closer to the higher end of the range. Regarding the loan loss reserve and coverage in 2017, we would expect the reserve to cover approximately 14 to 15 months of expected future net charge-offs, which should give you a way to think about the reserve builds throughout the year. We also need to consider how seasonality impacts reserve covers. For example, we typically see reserves as a percent of receivables increase 40 to 50 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, given the seasonal decline in receivables and we would expect the similar trend this year. Moving to the efficiency ratio, for 2017 we expect to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of around 32%. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, partially driven by the timing of the spend on some of those projects. Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. And we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And finally, we continue to expect to generate return on assets in the 2.5%-plus range in 2017. Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2017. We are planning to follow a very similar process to 2016. We will use the fed scenarios and assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we\u2019ll review with our Board and our regulators in early April. And we hope to gain a position to announce our capital plans in the June-July timeframe. While I can\u2019t be specific as to our capital plans at this point. We would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks in addition to supporting growth. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll close with an overview of our strategic priorities. First, we will continue to execute across our three sales platforms. Building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and mobile technology, we expect to continue increase in penetration at existing partners and we\u2019ll add new partners and programs. Second, we will continue to expand our robust data, analytics and technology offerings, and will continue our innovative strategy on mobile wallet development for private-label credit cards. Third, we will broaden our banking product suite to help increase loyalty, further diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. We will also leverage our expertise to explore opportunities to expand our core business, such as expanding our small business capabilities and growing proprietary networks and acceptance. Fourth, we will continue to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. Finally, we will continue to leverage our strong capital position. Our capital priorities are first and foremost organic growth and program acquisitions. Second, capital returns through dividends and share repurchases. And lastly, M&A that helps us enhance our capabilities to support growth. In closing, we accomplished a great deal this year and believe we are well positioned to continue to leverage our expertise, market position and innovative approach to digital platforms and analytics to grow our program, pursue opportunities and continue to deliver value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] and we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks and good morning. I guess the question I wanted to ask is around competition. Obviously, one of the key items that came out recently is the Chase\u2019s Amazon Card product, the enhancement they made for rewards. Could you just talk about what kind of implications you expect to have on your own growth for that product? And just in general, I guess, I was getting a lot of questions from people asking if this means that the outside banks that aren\u2019t in private-label are going to find their way into the space. Also, just maybe if you could clarify, the online sales growth number, Margaret, that you mentioned, it seemed to have slowed a little sequentially. Could you just talk about that as well? Thanks. Margaret Keane : So there was lot of questions there. So let me start with Amazon and Chase. So, first of all, both of our programs have actually sat side-by-side for the last 9 years. We have the private label program and we have the opportunity to offer promotional financing. So these two programs have been out there together the whole time. It\u2019s not surprising that Amazon wanted to match the value props. We knew that that was going to happen. We still believe that, given the growth of Amazon and our partnership with Amazon, that we have plenty of room to continue to grow. We see this as still a very big opportunity for us, particularly because of our partnership with them and the fact that we do have the promotional financing for big ticket it actually gives us some other opportunity. In terms of how we\u2019re looking at it in our 2017, I\u2019d just turn it over to Brian to kind of maybe comment on that. Brian Doubles : Yes. I\u2019d just reiterate what Margaret said, I mean, the two products have coexisted for a long period of time. And for the most part the products appeal to different consumers. And so, we\u2019ve been able to grow the program very well over the years. That\u2019s still our expectation going forward. Anything that we expect to see there has been obviously included in the guidance, so we just gave it on receivables. Margaret Keane : And then your question on kind of mobile and online, let me just give you a little flavor. So overall, you saw we continue to invest in digital. We rolled out SyPi in the fourth quarter, which we feel really good about. Our online sales were up 20% versus last year, which is still above the industry average, which is about 16%. I think one important metric is in our sales penetration for Retail Card. It totaled 20% of our sales, while the national average is about 8%. And we\u2019re now getting about 40% of our applications online. So if you think about where we\u2019re going and particularly where mobile is going. We also see big growth in mobile, in that over 50 million of our apps have [come overly] [ph] since 2012. And that\u2019s growing at above 42% year-over-year. So a little off of what we were running at, but certainly a very strong metric and one that we feel very good about. And see lots of opportunity in this space to continue to really outperform what the industry is performing at. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Donald Fandetti : Hi, good morning. Brian, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about any potential portfolio acquisitions. And also on the Cabela\u2019s deal Capital One ended up winning, it sounds like there is potentially some regulatory hurdles. They have to work through licenses. You guys were in there potentially as the cover bid. And I was just curious, if you think about a deal like that, I think one of the issues was that it was a bank. When you buy a retail portfolio, do you have any restrictions if there is a bank involved and like how quickly would you be able to get that type of approval? If you could just kind of talk about that a bit. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Don. So why don\u2019t I start with the pipeline. I mean, we continue to see a very strong pipeline across all three of our platforms. As you know, we don\u2019t build that into our guidance. So the outlook for 2017 of 7% to 9% on receivables is really organic growth. That\u2019s really continuing to take tender share, grow penetration side of the existing retailers. But we always hope to add programs throughout the year. We had a really strong year on new deals, new program wins. We feel very good about our competitive position in all three platforms. And so that expectation is that will continue through 2017. I think Cabela\u2019s, obviously - it\u2019s our practice not to comment on potential transactions. So there is really not a lot that I can add there unfortunately. Donald Fandetti : Can you talk maybe a little bit about broadly when you look at a portfolio, if there is a bank, is that a consideration or is that a hurdle for you, I should say, even just generally? Brian Doubles : Well, I think the - the consideration there is that if you\u2019re acquiring another charter it usually requires a more, I guess, regulatory approval or a non-objection potentially depending on what the charter is and who the acquiring bank is. And so I think that\u2019s certainly I think a consideration for anyone in the space as opposed to just if you\u2019re buying a portfolio without a charter. Again not commenting specifically on any particular transaction, but acquiring charter tends to create a little bit more of a regulatory hurdle. Donald Fandetti : Got it. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Richard Shane : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When we think about the consumer\u2019s decision to use private-label versus general purpose, I think the decision is really driven by sort of balancing the utility of having available to borrow on a private-label that doesn\u2019t reduce general purpose of borrowing and the incentives of rewards. And what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is reward incentive has gone up a ton. Are you guys seeing any shift in terms of how consumers are using the private-label card? Is that value proposition between utility and incentive changing in any meaningful way? Margaret Keane : Well, I would say that what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is, obviously, greater penetration in our partners on private-label. And a lot of that is driven by the value props that we put out, the 5% on Amazon, the Walmart value prop, those types of value props are important to the consumer. I mean, I think one thing that consumers continuing to look for is either some form of cash back or reward points that they can go in and spend more. Most of our private-label rewards are really around driving that customer back into our partners. So I would say that consumers are paying a lot more attention to the type of rewards they are getting. And they\u2019re really looking for some type of real financial benefit to really encourage them to spend more. And that something we continually research, we continually evaluate. We work with our partners to make sure we have fresh offers out there continually. And we continue to feel good about how we\u2019re positioned here and the work we do with our partners on the types of research we do in rolling out those types of programs. Richard Shane : Well, it\u2019s interesting because if you think about the distortion we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s really between the consumer and the issuer. The retailers\u2019 incentive to drive transactions toward private-label because of the lower transaction fee has been unchanged. Margaret Keane : True. I\u2019d also say from the retailer, because of our RSAs that\u2019s a very important element in addition to the overall getting customers to use. But I think the other piece that\u2019s important to note in all our research, we know that if a customers using a private-label credit card in one of our retailers, they tend to be the retailer\u2019s best customer. So those are the customers that are much more loyal and spending more within that retailer. So it really is not just about saving interchange or cost, it\u2019s really about growing sales for the retailer. And when a customer holds a private-label credit card, their basket tends to be bigger and they tend to make more trips to that particular retailer, whether it is in-store or online. Richard Shane : Terrific. Thanks, and sorry for the cell-phone ringtone in the background. That was the old Hartford Whalers\u2019 theme song. Brian Doubles : No problem, Rick. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks, guys. You commented a little bit on the efficiency ratio. And you mentioned, we should expect some operating leverage [with that] [ph] you\u2019re making certain investments in the platform. Maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on the types of investments and the timing. And then a little deeper in that is, what part of the expense structure in terms of line items, where we will see those inflections? Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure, John. So I think maybe just to frame it up, we should take a walk back through 2016. And in the last quarter\u2019s call, I indicated that growing revenues 13%, expense is only growing 5%, and driving 240 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio wasn\u2019t exactly a reasonable expectation going forward. So I think there are a couple of things to think about in 2017. So first on the revenue side, our expectation is that revenue grows more closely in line with the three year average, so more in line with receivables growth than what we did in 2016. And then on 2016 in particular, we ended up spending a little less on the strategic investments than we originally planned. And so, that drove part of the efficiency ratio benefit that we had in 2016. And it really is just driven by timing of some of the spend related to the projects. And now some of that spend is going to slip into 2017. So that\u2019s really the timing difference that we are talking about. In terms of the areas that we are investing it\u2019s all the things that we talked about in the past. It\u2019s digital capabilities, mobile, online, analytics, and it\u2019s really investing in those things. It\u2019s helping us deliver this very strong growth in what is a relatively weak retail environment. So when we look at the plan for 2017, we\u2019re absolutely driving operating leverage in the core business. However, it is our expectation that it will be offset by the incremental spend on the strategic projects just giving the timing dynamic that I just mentioned. Does that make sense? John Hecht : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Yeah. And then with respect to the NIM guidance, maybe you could break it down, how much do you expect the kind of NIM trends to be related to the rate environment versus, I guess, the contract prices versus what you are doing with your excess liquidity portfolio? Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure. So I\u2019d say generally most of the drivers on NIM should be fairly stable. There is always a few puts and takes. First, we are slightly asset sensitive, so we would expect to see a modest improvement from the rate hike that we just got in December, and the increase in prime. But then we expect to have a couple of offsets. Last year, particularly in the second half of 2016, we had a pretty significant lift in receivable yields. We saw higher revolve, frankly came in better than we expected it to. And we think that that benefit will moderate a bit into 2017. And then, one of the dynamics that we had all year-in 2016 was the really strong growth of Payment Solutions. We do expect that to continue. And the fact that those receivables come on at a lower yield than the portfolio average, that will give us some slight downward pressure on the margins. And the last thing I would just point out is that just given where the yield curve is right now, any unsecure or secured issuance we do in 2017 is likely to be a little more expensive. So I would say, generally fairly stable on the margins for 2017 with some slight downward bias. John Hecht : I appreciate the color. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Good morning. I just wanted to parse out some of the credit outlook commentary you provided. Specifically starting out with the charge-off rate guidance, how does that compare to your June guide of roughly 20 to 30 basis points kind of through the first-half of 2017. And now we\u2019re kind of looking towards more of 25 to 50 basis points higher for all of 2017. Is that really the mix or do you see just a little bit on the margin, a little more credenalization [ph] on the back half of maybe higher or more aggressive kind of growth on the part of consumer? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure, so no real change from what we previously indicated. We expect to continue to see credit normalize over time. The backdrop is still favorable. We still feel good about where unemployment is, where jobs are, so the consumer is generally healthy. As I mentioned in the comments earlier, our base plan has this a little below the midpoint of the range. So that\u2019s right in line with kind of where we thought would be back in June for the full year 2017. We obviously look at other scenarios and other assumptions that could push us toward the higher end as well. We look at things like portfolio mix and expected mix changes. We look at consumer trends and payment behaviors. And that\u2019s what really gave us that range of 4.75% to 5%. We\u2019ve also assumed a relatively stable macro environment, so we didn\u2019t include any lift from job growth, wage growth. It\u2019s really based on more of a status quo economy. So I think importantly, look, overall we are still very comfortable operating at these levels. And we really like the risk adjusted returns on the accounts we\u2019re booking. David Ho : Sure. And then, more specifically on the mix, are you still seeing some faster growth from stores with a slightly weaker customer mix? And maybe how much of that is being offset by kind of lower loss rate Dual Card growth? Brian Doubles : Yeah. I mean, those are all included in the guidance obviously. As we talked about in the past, our underwriting is very customized and we underwrite differently based on platform, by program, but also by channel and by product. So for us is not a one size fits all approach. So you can maintain very consistent credit guidelines, which we have. But given that we underwrite to different loss rates across all those different dynamics, portfolio mix can play a factor. And we certainly included that in the guidance that we provided. David Ho : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Could we talk a little bit about the Dual Card program and the expectations you have for expanding that? And how much of that is in the guidance that you provided in loan growth? Margaret Keane : Sure. So we\u2019re always looking to expand Dual Card. It\u2019s been a great product for us in terms of where we are. We try to get it into all big programs. So we continue to look at ways to encourage our partners to deliver Dual Card. And, 19 of our 26 customers already - or partners already have a Dual Card. So it\u2019s definitely part of our strategy. It\u2019s definitely something we feel really good about. And we\u2019ll continue to work with our partners to grow those programs. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Okay. And then, separately\u2026 Brian Doubles : And then, talking specifically on your guidance question, we obviously build in the current trends that we\u2019re seeing on growth related to Dual Card. What we don\u2019t build in though typically are new Dual Card launches. So as Margaret said, we have Dual Card in 19 of the 26 programs. For the other seven we haven\u2019t assumed that we do any big Dual Card launches there. So that would be incremental if we\u2019re able to get one or two of those done this year. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Okay, got it. And then a follow-up question on just the outlook for tax reduction and how you would use that strategically in your business, you\u2019re obviously a [full freight payer] [ph] right now. And if there were to be any tax changes that would reduce that for you, how would you think about that in your competitive position? Brian Doubles : Yes, now, it\u2019s a great question. Obviously, there are a lot of speculation going on right now. Typically, we don\u2019t spend money that we don\u2019t have. So I think we need to wait and see to see what kind of benefit we do realize on tax reform. Right now, we\u2019re funding the majority of the strategic projects that we\u2019ve identified. But obviously, we would take a look at that and see if there is maybe some more that we could do on that front to drive growth. I think, it would be the same things that we\u2019re investing in now. But maybe it just is we do a little bit more that. We might invest a little bit more in promotions, value propositions. All things are going to continue to drive growth to make the business better. The key question I think is how does the competitive environment change under tax reform and we\u2019ll obviously have to react to that as well. Betsy Lynn Graseck : And do your clients expect to get any of that tax improvement that you would generate for themselves? Would that be part of the discussion you think? Brian Doubles : Well, I think that\u2019s going to be part of the discussion on all of this. Like I said, I think we\u2019re going to have to see how the competition reacts to this. And, I think to the extent that there is real savings here, we\u2019re going to have to react to the competitive reality of that. But I think that\u2019s we\u2019re really speculating now. I think first we have to see what tax reform looks like and then I think we have to see what competitors end up doing. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. So it looks like the loan growth guidance for 2017, again, it was biased to be conservative than last year. You guys came in 300 basis points above the high-end of your guidance. I guess my question is what kind of headwinds do you see the loan growth that would justify kind of a midpoint that\u2019s again kind of 400 basis points below your run rate for 2016. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Mark. So, look, obviously 2016 was a very strong year. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio. I think the headline growth numbers were good. When you break down and look at the customer level metrics, you see really good trends on purchase volume per active account was up 3%, the balances per account were up 5%. So these are all good indicators that the consumers are seeing real value on the cards. So I think generally we feel really good about how we\u2019re positioned here. When we build the outlook for 2017, you have to remember that the 79% is an organic growth target. And if you go back over the past five years and you strip out the impact from new deals and portfolio acquisitions and new value props, organic growth tends to be in that 7% to 9% range. And that\u2019s typically what we build the plan around. It also assumes that we\u2019re still operating in this relatively weak retail environment that\u2019s growing around 2% to 3%. So we didn\u2019t include any lift from potential wage growth or we didn\u2019t build in any material gains and consumer confidence. So given those dynamics and the growing balances at 7% to 9% with retail sales growing in the 2% range is a pretty good result. And, obviously, based on my earlier comments, we\u2019ve got a really strong pipeline of new deals. And we\u2019re working really hard to bring those on. Those would help us maybe be a little bit better than this. And obviously, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to do, but we tend to build the plan around organic growth and don\u2019t include things that are uncertain or that we don\u2019t know about. Mark DeVries : Okay. But just a follow-up on that point, I mean, I think BP - wasn\u2019t VP like your biggest contributor in organic growth and didn\u2019t that lap kind of in the first half of the year, so the 12% run rate you are at in the back half of the year is relatively close to a clean organic number, right? Brian Doubles : Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it, because again remember we strip out value proposition changes too when we think about that. So we had a very significant change to the value prop at Walmart, Amazon is largely in the comps now. But that\u2019s certainly giving us some lift in 2016. So we don\u2019t build those things in and then sometimes those can happen midyear and help the results quite a bit. But you\u2019re right on BP. We also brought on Mattress Firm, Guitar Center and some others that are in the past couple years. Mark DeVries : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning. Margaret, I had a follow-up question for you on your earlier comments around the competitive reward dynamics that we\u2019re seeing. It seems to us like you guys are relatively more isolated from the rewards for dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the general purpose space. Do you agree with that characterization? And do you think that puts Synchrony on a relative damage in anyway? Margaret Keane : Well, I think - I would say, yes. And I think part of that is driven by the fact that when we think about value prop and rewards. It\u2019s really within the context of our partners. And if you really look at someone who would use our card consistently, they would save more money and get more benefits over time if they use their cards every time they go into our partner. So I think if you really looked at the richness of our rewards, they\u2019re actually better and the consumer can really get some real advantages there. So I do think we are a bit outside of the big reward programs. And it really does come down to a consumer who has real brand loyalty to a particular partner, who sees the value that they\u2019re getting on their card and continually use that card and feel like they\u2019re really gaining some real advantage by the rewards that we put together for those particular programs. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Brian, I had a question for you on the - on your allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period-end receivables. Assuming that the credit environment remains unchanged from where it is today, would the year-over-year change in that ratio continue to rise gradually higher at the same trajectory that we\u2019ve been seeing as credit continues to normalize or would it flatten out at some point? I\u2019m not looking to kind of get you to commit to where the ratio is going to go, but we\u2019d just love to hear your just brought thoughts on the mechanics of how that works at this point in the cycle. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. I mean, obviously as charge-offs are normalizing, you would expect the reserve percentage on receivable to continue to increase. And the best way for you to model that I think is we\u2019d expect reserve coverage, and again, this is not how we book the reserve, but we would expect reserve coverage against future net charge-offs to be in that 14 to 15 months of coverage range. So I think if you take your charge-off forecast and you back into what the reserves will need to be to maintain that coverage ratio, that should give you a pretty good way to think about it. So more specific to your question, as charge-offs start to level off, and we do expect normalization will level off at some point, when that happens you would expect coverage increases to level off as well. And you get to more of a steady state. Now, I can\u2019t give you a quarter as to when exactly that\u2019s going to happen, but at some point in the future and certainly post 2017 at some point, we would expect that to happen, and so those two should level off together. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I guess, just on that last point I do think historically you talked about something around 4.75% to 5% being normal for charge-offs. And clearly you said you don\u2019t expect this to be the year where charge-offs inevitably level off. But do you still feel comfortable that that\u2019s the range where we should expect charge-offs to begin to level off? Brian Doubles : Yes, right. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given a normalized charge-off level. We\u2019ve kind of given you annual guidance as we see things. And part of the reason for that is there is clearly a lot of variables that go into that. You kind of have to pick an economic scenario. You have to pick unemployment number, jobs, wage growth, confidence, all those things in order to provide that. So we give you our best outlook for the next 12 months. We feel like we have a pretty good visibility around that. We\u2019ve done that for 2017. I think importantly, as you think about normalization, normalization assuming all else being equal, and you\u2019re still in this favorable environment, credit should - the credit trend should level off at some point. But again it\u2019s hard to pick a quarter in terms of when that is actually going to happen. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe if I could ask a question on the RSA, clearly this past year was impacted by the large reserve builds. And now you\u2019re talking about going back to 4.4% to 4.5%, which was similar to 2015 levels now. Now, I think you didn\u2019t have any provision growth that year. So I\u2019m just trying to marry a couple of different things. The efficiency ratio is going up. We are saying charge-offs are going up and there is a potential that loan growth is decelerating. So I\u2019m just trying to understand like why would be RSA be going up under that environment. Couldn\u2019t we infer that you can have - the provision growth is clearly going to slow or retailers getting a bigger share? And then I guess, you did comment that Payment Solutions could grow faster, which doesn\u2019t have RSA attached to it. I\u2019m just trying to think about all those different comments together and tying it to the RSA. Brian Doubles : Yeah. So obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces here and we talked about it on the past. You have to factor in all aspects of the program. So to your point, margin, credit, operating expense, you\u2019ve got program mix, the deal structures are all different and have different tiers and you also have growth. So all of those things have to be factored in. And again I recognize it\u2019s difficult for you guys to model, that\u2019s why we tell you what we think it\u2019s going to be for the year. And maybe one way to think about it, Ryan, is that, you alluded to 2015, so if you take 2015 for a second, just drop 2016 from a minute, we reported a 4.4% RSA in 2015. And then if you do a comparison to what we are guiding to for 2017, you will see that for 2017 our efficiency ratio is planned to be much better than it was in 2015 and the margins will also be better. And so you have those two dynamics offset with higher provisions. And that gets you back to a similar kind of RSA rate. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg Ketron : Hey, Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I guess, just a follow-up on the questions on Amazon. Would you be willing to just talk a little bit about what portion of the customers use that promotional financing, because I was interested by the comments, Brian, about the revolve rates going up, because I would imagine the customers that Chase might attract away would be people that might be more of convenience user type and perhaps not the ones that would be your core customer in any case? Margaret Keane : Yes, I think, basically, we probably target different customer basis between the Chase program and ours. We don\u2019t really disclose what the percentage of people who take the value prop. But if you think about the products that Amazon sells, big ticket TVs, whatever, that\u2019s what you usually see us being offered as, as one of opportunities for the customer to go after. I think the other maybe people think of prime customers as prime customers, and they\u2019re not necessarily all prime customers, right? So obviously, we\u2019ll go little deeper than Chase would go. So I think our target markets are slightly different so that\u2019s why in terms of how we think of the overall Amazon program, we still think that has plenty of opportunity for us to really sit side-by-side with Chase, what we\u2019ve been doing over the years. I think the real different here is the value props are now matched. So we\u2019ll continue to watch and then see what the impact is. We knew about program before it was launched. It was built into our 2017 guidance. So we still - I mean, listen, it\u2019s a great program and we feel great about our partnership. And what we are doing with Amazon. There\u2019s still tons of opportunity there. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And just a follow-up, I think the definition of organic growth that you used kind of surprised me, because it\u2019s actually more conservative than I would have thought. I mean most of - I think other companies generally would have considered value prop changes and other things like that as organic growth. Is there any way you could kind of just approximate what those value prop changes have benefited the growth rate in the last few years, like is it 1 point, is it 2 points? Brian Doubles : So just to be clear on that, we absolutely build in any value props that we know about or that have been agreed to with our partners. So if we were sitting here today in January and we knew that in March or June we were going to rollout a new value prop on one of our programs, we would obviously build that into our plans and we\u2019d build that into the outlook. What we don\u2019t build in are things that are just being kind of discussed and are very preliminary at this point. It\u2019s really hard to go back over time and we certainly tried internally. I am not going to give you percentage. But it\u2019s hard to strip out and say, okay, here\u2019s what purchase volume would have been if we were just doing weekly, monthly promotions versus an everyday value prop. We certainly have a view on that when we launched these things, but it\u2019s hard to go back over the past two or three years, and strip that out entirely for you. What I can tell you though is there - go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : I was just going to say, but there has been some upside to it over the last several\u2026 Brian Doubles : Absolutely, I mean, if you look at - think about the three big value props that we launched in last two years, Walmart 3-2-1 the most recent one, the Sam\u2019s Club value prop and Amazon. Those clearly helped our growth rates. And we\u2019d be really excited to continue to do that. We are in discussions with all of our partners on beefing up the value propositions on the cards. We just don\u2019t build in anything that we don\u2019t know about at this point. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks so much. Brian Doubles : Yes. Greg Ketron : Hey, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on slide 3. First quarter net earnings totaled $499 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Our results were impacted by the 45% increase in the provision for loan losses we experienced this quarter, which was driven by growth and the normalization trends we are seeing in the portfolio and also by lower recovery pricing. Brian will describe these items in more detail later in the call. Continued execution of our business strategies helped generate strong organic growth in each of our sales platforms, which resulted in double-digit growth in loan receivable and interest and fees on loans for the company, as you can see on slide 4 of today's presentation. Furthermore, we grew purchase volume 7% and average active accounts 5% over the first quarter of last year. We are delivering value to partners and cardholders through attractive value propositions, promotional financing and strategic marketing offers, and this is helping to generate this growth. Looking at just our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 21%, exceeding U.S. growth trends which have been around 15%. And our Retail Card online sales penetration reached 26% in the first quarter. Net charge-offs came in at 5.33%, compared to 4.74% in the first quarter of last year. Our efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter versus 30.4% last year. Strong deposit generation supported the growth we generated this quarter. Deposits increased $7 billion or 15% to $52 billion. Deposits now comprise 72% of our funding sources. With a continued focus on competitive rates and customer service, we believe we can continue to drive deposit growth, though we would expect for that growth trend to be more in line with our receivables growth over the longer-term. Regarding capital and liquidity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 18%, and liquid assets totaled $16 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter-end. And we continued to execute our capital plan with quarterly common stock dividend of $0.13 and a repurchase of $238 million of common stock during the quarter. Looking at the business highlights this quarter, we renewed key partnerships with Belk, QVC and Midas. We also launched our Synchrony Car Care program, which offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. We also continue to seek new partnership to augment growth, and we are excited to have launched our new program with Cathay Pacific during the quarter. In addition, as we continue to seek ways to expand our networking capabilities, we recently made two acquisitions. We acquired the Citi Health Card portfolio, which further expands our healthcare acceptance network in the United States. We also acquired GPShopper, an innovative developer of mobile apps that offers retails and brands a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytics tools. We are expanding our mobile engagement capabilities, improving the functionality and ease of use for our mobile users and our partners. And this capability-enhancing acquisition will help us to do that. You can view our sales platform performance on slide 5. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Thanks, Margaret. And I'll start on slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $499 million of net income, translates to $0.61 per diluted share. We continued to deliver strong growth, with purchase volume up 7%, and loan receivables and interest and fees on loan receivables up 11% over last year. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 5% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continued to resonate with consumers. Positive trends continued in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 6% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision for loan losses increased 45% over last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. The reserve build was higher than we had expected. While most of the build continues to be driven by growth and the normalization we are seeing in the portfolio, lower recovery pricing in the quarter also drove approximately $50 million of additional reserves or 7 basis points of coverage. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-day-plus delinquencies were 4.25% and the net charge-off rate was 5.33%. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.37%. RSAs were up $14 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 3.7% for the quarter, compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailers sharing in the incremental provision expense, which offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year growth in the programs. Looking forward into 2017 and given the trend so far in the first quarter, we think RSAs will run closer to the 2016 level of around 4.1% to 4.2% for the full year. Other income was essentially flat versus last year. Other expenses increased $108 million or 14% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. And the efficiency ratio was 30.3%, slightly lower than the 30.4% ratio last year. I'll move to slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.18%, up 34 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we are holding and have deployed excess liquidities for our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables is relatively flat at 21.2%, down 4 basis points compared to the prior year. Revolve rate improved compared to the prior year, and we received a modest benefit from the increase to the prime rate. However, those improvements were offset by the impact on mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The platform's receivables have grown on average 15%, compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 10% to 11% range over the past year. Lastly, funding cost improved by 6 basis points driven by improved funding mix. Our deposit base increased by $7 billion, and was 72% of our funding sources versus 69% a year ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources, so the margin benefited from the shift in the funding mix to lower cost deposits. So, overall, we continue to be pleased with our net interest margin performance, with the margin exceeding our expectations for the first quarter. And if the trends we're seeing so far this year continue, we would expect the margin for the full year to be between 16% and 16.25%, which is better than the outlook we put out back in January. And lastly, just to reiterate the impact of seasonality on our net interest margin throughout the year, we would expect the net interest margin to come in at the low-end of the range in the second quarter, given we expect to carry more liquidity in the quarter. Then the margin typically increases in the second half of the year and should move towards the higher end of the range, as we deploy liquidity to support the seasonal build in receivables. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. As we noted previously, we continue to anticipate credit to normalize from the levels we experienced over the past couple of years. We expect this normalization to occur over time and is driven by a number of factors, including portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30-day-plus delinquencies were 4.25% compared to 3.85% last year, and 90-day-plus delinquencies were 2.06% versus 1.84% last year. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.33%, compared to 4.74% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. Our outlook for 2017 was for the net charge-offs to continue to normalize into the range of 4.75% to 5%, approximately 25 to 50 basis points higher than 2016. Given what we've seen so far, we now expect NCOs to be in the 5% to low-5% range this year, depending on how some of the factors play out. Normalization will continue to be the largest factor and, incrementally, the impact of lower recovery pricing pushes us into this range. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.37% and the reserve build from the fourth quarter was $332 million. While most of the build is related to growth and normalization, the reserve build also reflects the lower recovery pricing we saw in the quarter, which drove approximately $50 million of additional reserves or 7 basis points of coverage. Looking forward, based on what we are seeing across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions continue to be stable, we believe that our loss rate will continue to trend higher into 2018, then start to level off in the second half of the year. We expect the net charge-off rate to be in the low- to mid-5% range for 2018. Given that expectation as well as continued strong growth, the reserve builds for the next couple of quarters are likely to be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw this quarter. In summary, while credit will continue to normalize from here, we continue to see good opportunities for growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $908 million, up 14% over last year. The efficiency ratio was 30.3%, relatively flat to last year. For the full year, given the strong growth in receivables and the higher expectations on margins for the year, we now expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5%, which is better than the outlook we provided in January. As we've noted in the past, we expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, driven by the timing of the spend on some of our projects. Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $7 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 72% of our funding, higher than the 69% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer-term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017. Funding through securitizations was 17% of our funding, consistent with our target of 15% to 20%. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources, within our 10% to 15% target. So, overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.7% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year. Total liquidity decreased slightly compared to the prior year to $21.8 billion, which is equal to 24.4% of our total assets. This is down from 27.2% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to execute our share repurchase plan, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. I'd also like to provide an update on our 2017 capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the timeline last year, and we hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans in the June-July timeframe. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I wanted to summarize for you our current view on 2017. Given the strong receivables growth and higher revolve rates we've seen so far this year, we believe the margin for the full year will be in the 16% to 16.25% range, which is better than the outlook we provided back in January. This further demonstrates one of the natural offsets in the business. Some of the same factors driving credit normalization also result in higher receivables yield than we expected back in January. So we are seeing a partial offset on the revenue line. Given what we've seen so far, we now expect NCOs to be in the 5% to low-5% range, depending on how some of these factors play out. Normalization will continue to be the largest factor, and incrementally, the impact of lower recovery pricing pushes us into this range. Regarding the loan loss reserve builds, given continued credit normalization and strong growth, we believe that reserve builds for the next couple of quarters are likely to be in a similar range to what we saw this quarter. We now think RSAs run closer to the level we experienced in 2016 between 4.1% to 4.2% Moving to the efficiency ratio. For 2017, we had expected to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of around 32%. However, given the strong growth in receivables and the higher expectation on margins for the year, we now expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5%. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, driven by the timing of the spend on some of our projects. With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap-up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. While the reserve build impacted our results this quarter, we continued to deliver strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms. We renewed key programs, made strategic acquisitions and launched new programs during the quarter. We continued to drive deposit growth and maintained a strong balance sheet. We also returned capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. We continue to focus on our strategic priorities and believe they will help us generate additional growth and strong returns as we look ahead. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron - Synchrony Financial : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah, John. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thanks very much. So, just with respect to credit, a couple of questions. Number one is, so if I just do the math relative to our model and it sounds like the dollar increase allowance build is going to be similar to this quarter for the next couple of quarters, it gets us to an allowance range of about 7% relative to receivables. And yet you all are guiding about 25 basis points in terms of charge-off content. So I'm wondering can you reconcile more than 100 basis points build in ALL (20:30) relative to the 25 basis points build in net charge-offs. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Sure, John. I mean, the coverage is obviously driven by a number of different factors, including whatever your growth assumption is. And there that's why we've tried to be as helpful as we can in terms of telling you how to think about it on a dollar basis. But as you think about the reserve builds for 2017, they'll continue to be driven by really two factors; growth in our receivables, which we're off to a very strong start this year; as well as the normalization trends that we're seeing. So, as you move throughout the year, you also have to factor in the fact that the reserve will start to pick up 2018 as you roll forward. And so the reserve build in this quarter as well as the next two quarters will start to pick up 2018. So we would expect that to be the dynamic really for the next couple of quarters. And then as you move into 2018, we indicated towards the back half we expect the credit trends will start to level off and we'd expect the reserve builds to kind of run in advance of that, and the reserve build in 2018 would be more reflective of growth and include a little bit less of that normalization component. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned \u2013 you gave some specifics about recovery rates, but then you also cited channel mix and so forth. And I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more detail what \u2013 is there growth at certain retail partners that has a different credit mix than maybe you've seen before, or any color on that concept would be helpful. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Sure. I mean, portfolio mix is something that we've highlighted in the past. We've talked about the fact that our underwriting is very customized, and we underwrite differently based on the platform, the program, the channel and the product. So it's really multi-variant, if you think about it, across the spectrum there. And so our credit guidelines have been pretty consistent across those areas. But we do underwrite to different loss rates in some of those areas. So, depending on the growth rates that we're seeing in certain segments of the portfolio, mix can be a driver and certainly influences the composition of the vintages and then how those vintages subsequently perform. And if you look at it today, today we would have a larger percent of the book in those newer vintages and in those areas of the portfolio that have had higher growth rates really in 2015 and 2016. So, that's driving the dynamic that we're seeing. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Right. Thank you, guys, very much for the color. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Hi. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I guess, staying on credit, when we think about the step-change in the charge-off rate guidance, I just want to make sure, is it mainly the recovery pricing? And I guess, can that recovery pricing change as a result of recovery experience? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. So I would say it's a combination of a couple of things. One is, just based on how we started the year \u2013 and I wouldn't call it a step-change, Sanjay. I would say we were 4.75% to 5%. We're now saying 5% to low-5% range. So we moved it up largely based on how we started the year here in the first quarter and what we're seeing around recovery pricing. The recovery pricing itself, it can move around a little bit. We highlighted, I think it was $36 million back in the third quarter of last year. We saw an incremental decline in pricing this quarter. We believe it's driven by a combination of factors, including just the fact that you've got increased supply in the market. As charge-offs start to normalize across the industry, which we've seen, you've got that dynamic. So you've got just increased supply in the market, which we think is impacting the price. And then to probably a lesser extent, you've got the costs that some of the buyers have added to improve their processes in response to the proposed new regulations. I think that was probably a little more of a driver in the third quarter of last year. I think the dynamic that we're seeing now is probably a little more supply-driven. Look, the one thing I'd highlight is that we run a regular NPV analysis on these sales. And if we start to see more deterioration on the pricing, we may pull back on some of these sales and start to collect on the accounts or other means. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And I guess when we think about \u2013 one of the questions I get a decent amount is just your reserve coverage and the differences in your reserve coverage relative to your peers. Let's just talk about your reserve coverage rate relative to your peers and how you see that kind of unfolding as charge-offs start leveling off? Does that reserve coverage rate come down? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Sure. So, obviously, it's hard for me to speak to how others reserve. Our reserve is based on our best estimate of the incurred losses that we have in the book at the end of the reporting period. I would say our model is to generally look out over a 12-month window. But our reserve, it includes principal as well as interest and fees. We also have qualitative and other factors that we include in there. So, when you add up those pieces, it typically equates to 14 to 15 months of coverage. But as I've said in the past, that is not how we book the reserve. It just gives you some guidepost in terms of how to think of it. It kind of equates to that 14 to 15 months. But we're not targeting that. That's really more of the output and how it ends up comparing to the next 12 months' charge-offs. Other than that, we have a lot of good disclosure in the Qs and the Ks that tell you about the factors that we consider and that we build into the models. But, again, it's kind of tough to compare to what others do. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Brian and Margaret. Brian, given this is now the second credit change we've had over the last three quarters, you gave us guidance looking out pretty far over the next, call it, four or five quarters. Like, what gives you the confidence that losses will actually begin to start leveling off in the back half of next year? What is it that you're seeing across vintages that would give us comfort that this could actually start to happen versus another potential to see the losses drift higher beyond your expectations? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Sure, Ryan. I mean part of this is, if you think about our growth, it really started to accelerate in second, third quarter 2015 through the first half of 2016. And that's obviously driving the dynamic that we're seeing here. It's driven by the factors that I've highlighted in the past, portfolio mix, like program, product, channel, all those same components. However, when we look at the more recent vintages and how kind of an early read on those, as well as other factors just including things like the growth rates in some of the higher loss areas of the portfolio, that gives us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the second half of 2018. So it's really a combination of early read in the more recent vintages from the second half of 2016, as well as we have been growing in certain areas at a very healthy clip here in 2015 and 2016. And just given now that we're comping against some of those really high growth rates, they started to moderate a bit. And so the mix impact that we're feeling there should lessen as we get more towards the back half of 2018. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Two quick follow-ups, I guess. One, as you look at the performance of your more recent vintage relative to the older ones, are you seeing underlying deterioration in, call it, the 2015 versus the 2016? I know that there's some channel mix that obviously weighs on that. And then, just to follow-up as to the last question, if you are expecting charge-offs to begin to level off in the back half of 2018, should we expect the reserve to actually to start to begin to level off in the back half of this year or maybe into early next year? Thanks. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah, Ryan. Let me take the second one first. I would expect the reserve to start to level off in advance of what we expect to see on charge-offs. Obviously, your reserve is forward-looking. So I think, not to get too specific about it, but as you start out into 2018, the reserve build should be more reflective of growth and include less of that normalization component that we expect to see for 2017. And sorry, Ryan, take me back to your first question. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just underlying what are you seeing in the subsequent vintages. Are you seeing similar performance, are you seeing worse performance, any color you can provide there? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. I think, consistent to what others are seeing, 2015 and 2016 have higher loss content. I would say back half of 2016 is a little better than first half of 2016 for us. I don't know how that looks relative to others. The underwriting box for us has been largely consistent. But if you look at the past couple years, our growth rates did really accelerate in the second half of 2015 and 2016. And those vintages, second half of 2015, first half of 2016, are seasoning at somewhat higher delinquency levels, driven by the factors that we've talked about, portfolio, channel mix. But, again, the early read on the more recent vintages gives us some comfort as well as an updated view of the growth rates going forward on some of those higher loss areas of the portfolio, give us some comfort that we'll work our way out of this towards the back half of 2018. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. I had a question about \u2013 there's been a lot of talk about retailer bankruptcies and just wanted to kind of get your sense on, based on your history, how that plays out when a retailer does go bankrupt? How long that process takes? And then, secondarily, have you ever had any experiences where another retailer that's not part of your portfolio suffers a bankruptcy and that can lead to sort of a pickup at your retailers. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics? Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Sure. So, first, let me start off by saying that when we do a new transaction and we have a mix of retailers on our portfolio, we're always watching the performance of the underlying economics and balance sheet of that particular retailer. But our risk is really with the consumer, not the retailer. And so I'd say when a retailer's gone bankrupt, it's their going into bankruptcy where they're going to restructure their debt and kind of come out in the end, and maybe less stores but continue to run the operation, we work very closely with them on that whole process. They usually let us know ahead of time. We work with them. One of the things that's important if they're coming out and want to continue operating as a retailer is, the credit card program becomes a very important element of how they drive their growth going forward. In a case where they're closing the doors and they're liquidating, in that case, our experience has shown, based on how we operate, that we can liquidate those portfolios profitably. I would say, again, we work really then with the consumer to make sure the consumer understands they're still responsible for the debt. Most consumers understand that, and they end up paying their bills. And then on the last question, I'd say I think that is an opportunity. And we've talked to some of our retailers who are strong and seeing some opportunities. As other retailers do go through bankruptcy, we do see pickup, especially in the specialty retailer market, where you'll have some of the recent closures that have happened that help some of our retailers pick up sales. So, that's both sides of the equation that we see. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Morning. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Morning. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I have a question on your commentary around the RSA trajectory. Just wondering if we're going to be continuing to increase reserves. And just to be clear, the reserve build that you did this quarter, I think that was $322 million, and you're expecting over the next several quarters that you'll be adding to reserves around that same level of $300 million, plus, minus. That's what I heard. Let me know if that's accurate. And if that's the case, why is the RSA profit share moving higher as opposed to staying where it is this quarter? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Sure, Betsy. So the reserve build in the quarter was $332 million. And we said for the next couple of quarters, assume it's in that range. So we're not being that precise around it, obviously. We're going to have to adjust to what's happening in the quarter when we record the allowance. But in terms of the RSA, for the quarter, we were at 3.7% of receivables, which is well below the 4.4% to 4.5% that we guided to for the year. So you're definitely seeing an offset. You also have to remember that a lot of things were better year-over-year. We had good growth, higher margins, which would have resulted in a higher RSA than we had originally forecasted. However, those improvements were more than offset by the incremental provisions. As you think about it for the balance of the year, you have to factor in that in the third quarter we typically hit a high point on the RSA percentage. You typically have lower charge-offs. Just seasonally, yield comes up on the book. And so, when you factor that in, it gets us in that 4.1% to 4.2% range for the year. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just two follow-ups on that outlook for RSA into 2018. You gave us some of your other 2018 commentary. Maybe you could help us with that one. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. It's really a little early to start giving RSA guidance beyond that. Obviously, you have to take new deals into account, renewals and things like that. So there's quite a bit that could happen here in the back half of the year that could influence that number. So I wouldn't want to start giving 2018 guidance on the RSA. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then you highlighted that RSAs are typically higher in 3Q when the NCOs are tracking down. So are you saying you're expecting normal seasonality to come through into 3Q? Is that something you could give us some color on? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. There's still going to be a seasonal component to the book. I'm not going to range the magnitude or give quarterly guidance on the NCO rate. But that seasonal component we would expect to still be there, both on the top line as well as what we're seeing on credit. So, it tends to be relatively stable in the first half of the year. You see charge-offs come down in the third quarter. They tick back up in the fourth. On the margin side, you see yield come up in the third quarter, comes back down in the fourth a bit with the seasonal build in receivables. So we would expect those trends to still play through for the year. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just lastly on the RSA, so the 3.6% this quarter did reflect some of the share that you had with your retailers for the reserve build that you did in 1Q. Would you be sharing that reserve build that you're doing over the next several quarters with them as well? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. That's just part of how they work. For all the programs where we have an RSA, all of our partners share in net charge-offs and the majority of them share in the reserve build as well. We have a couple of programs where that's not the case. So there can be a little bit of a lag in terms of the offset, but, for the most part, they're sharing in that and that's really what drove the RSA percentage down from that 4.4% to 4.5% range that we had guided to down to 3.7% for the quarter. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. I guess, first, maybe from a high level, could you just talk about what things you're doing differently, if anything, in response to this? Like, are you doing things either to tighten from a credit perspective or from a profitability perspective to kind of mitigate some of these results? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Sure, Moshe. So we're always making refinements to the underwriting models across the portfolio based on the trends that we're seeing. And while I'll say that overall our underwriting standards and the cutoffs have been largely consistent, you see that if you look at the FICO stats (37:45) on the portfolio, which has been pretty consistent for a number of years now. But given we're still seeing attractive risk-adjusted returns, we haven't made what I would call significant changes to our underwriting model to tighten up. The changes that we've been making, we'll continue to make, are pretty surgical in nature. They're specific to certain portfolios, certain credit strategies. We're always adjusting things like line assignments, refining upgrade strategies and things like that. So, yeah, we tightened a bit in the second half. We'll continue to refine our strategies here as we move throughout 2017. We saw that actually improve some of the performance in the more recent vintages. So, look, we're obviously adapting to what we're seeing as these high growth vintages mature. But I wouldn't say it's anything dramatic that's going to slow the growth rate of the business. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then maybe just to come back from a reserving perspective. I mean, you've gotten this question really in a bunch of different ways. But I guess I still kind of struggle, the $50 million that you referred to with respect to recovery pricing, is that something that becomes part of a consistent reserve build? Like, it seems like that should be something that's more or less one-time. And so maybe why is it that you're talking still about reserve builds that are comparable to this level? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Look, the $50 million is one-time based on the market pricing that we got in the quarter. Hard to tell when we go back out if we'll see another adjustment there. We don't have any visibility into that at this point. And we're really not trying to be that specific. We're saying, look, assume the magnitude of reserve build for the next couple of quarters will include a component for the strong growth that we continue to have as well as normalization. And that puts the reserve build in the same range as what we have this quarter. But that's about as specific as we can be. We're trying to give you a way to think about it over the next couple of quarters. But I can't pinpoint a dollar amount today and tell you what exactly we're going to book in the second and the third quarters. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. And I appreciate that. Just a quick comment and that is that you have to appreciate our perspective that the impact of the reserve build is kind of four times as important as an effective change in charge-offs because it's \u2013 and so it puts us in just a difficult position. So, as you go forward, future guidance and information on that would be helpful. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. No, Moshe, we understand that. And the reserve build in the quarter, as we said, was higher than we expected and that's why we're giving you a framework for how to think about it for the next couple of quarters, which is all predicated again on the net charge-off trends that we're seeing, so. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. It's going to be another question on reserve build because I'm still kind of confused about why we're talking about this kind of reserve build. Maybe I misheard your comments. Brian, did you indicate you also expect 5% to low-5% charge-offs for 2018 as well or did I mishear that? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : For 2018, we're in low- to mid-5s. So we do expect the charge-offs. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Low- to mid-5s. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. So we expect the charge-offs to continue to trend up in 2018, leveling off in the back half. So, as you start to build reserves for that, you're picking up more of the 2018 dynamic as well as the fact that we moved our forecast up for 2017 as well. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So the thing that I'm most confused about then is, if we talk about the same type of reserve build for the next two quarters, you basically added 60 basis points of coverage in one quarter, right? So, if we did that two more times, we'd be at like 7.5% coverage on 5.5% charge-offs at the high-end of that range for 2018. So why are we building so much incremental cushion over kind of what you're guiding to in terms of an 18-month forward charge-offs here? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah, Mark. I think you might be missing the growth component that would bring that percentage down. We wouldn't be in that kind of range on the reserve coverage. But you also have to factor in the seasonality, right? The reserve coverage typically increases second quarter, third quarter, and comes down in the fourth quarter. And when you get to the fourth quarter of 2017, your reserve coverage should look largely in line with that low- to mid-5% range of charge-offs for 2018. That's just another way to think about it is as you move throughout the year, your reserve coverage at the end of the fourth quarter should reflect what we expect to see for 2018, which is at low- to mid-5% range. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then just a question on the seasonality you're assuming in your guidance for this year. As I look back at the last two years, the back-half seasonality was pretty different in 2015 versus 2016. It was much more muted in 2016. So, if I use the seasonality of 2016, I'm getting to like a 5.175% average charge-off for 2017, assuming no incremental upward bias for normalization. Are you kind of implicitly assuming a little bit more pronounced seasonality than we saw in 2016? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. I don't think we're assuming anything incremental on seasonality. That charge-off range would be in the range of what we're indicating in the 5% to low-5% range. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Hey, Rick. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : One of the things that is unique about your portfolio is the idiosyncratic risk associated with the different retailers. And I know that you say that you're tied to the consumer, but there is a utility factor tied to the specific retailers. When you look at the recovery pricing that you're describing, is one of the things that's causing the tiering of your sales into the secondary market a function of which retailer portfolios you're selling off? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. We don't think so, Rick. I think it really is driven by the factors that I mentioned earlier. We know for a fact that there's increased supply in the market. You've seen charge-offs normalize across the entire industry. We think that's probably the primary driver this quarter. And remember, we're coming off of historically low loss rates. So there was definitely a supply-demand imbalance in 2014, 2015, a little bit into 2016, and now that's started to come back and normalize a bit. And we think that's driving the majority of what we're seeing on pricing. And then I think the secondary factor is just buyers have added a lot of cost to get out in front of some of these proposed new regulations and we think that that's probably secondary driver. But I don't think it's specific to anything idiosyncratic or anything related to any of our retail partners. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. In that vein, not only in terms of secondary pricing, but how much churn do you see from a credit performance perspective related to retailers? And again, the question came up before, but I assume in a scenario where a retailer is at risk, the utility of that card to the consumer goes down and that impacts willingness to pay. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. There's definitely some of that, Rick. Typically, if a retailer is going to go through bankruptcy and then liquidate, we usually adjust our reserve modestly to accommodate for that dynamic. But then we always liquidate properly because the vast majority of the consumers want to protect their credit rating. They know they still owe the debt and they pay us back. And so we've been through a few of these over our history and they always liquidate profitably, and again, because the consumer knows that they're still obligated on the debt. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Again on the reserve build, I fully appreciate the commentary, but in terms of the kind of build over the charge-off acceleration, just want to clarify that, again, the $300 million is kind of the incremental reserve build even with the higher guide in charge-offs for next couple of quarters? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : That's right. The higher guide on charge-offs for 2017 and the new outlook we put out there for 2018 inform kind of the reserve build over the next couple of quarters. So, that's exactly how to think about it. You're picking up both 2017, what we expect to see for the balance of the year in net charge-offs, as well as every quarter as we move forward you're picking up another quarter of 2018. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then in terms of the credit normalization that has accelerated, do you believe that that could slow \u2013 or is that part of your assumption in terms of the leveling off in 2018 in terms of the loss rate guide, that credit normalization, more underlying even if you had adjusted for a portfolio mix and some of the things you're seeing would start to level off maybe if overall kind of consumer leverage and the economy start to scale off as well? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. I mean, all of our comments are based on a relatively stable macro environment. So we're really talking about based on dynamics that we've seen and the vintage curves and the portfolio mix. That gives us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the second half of 2018. But, again, it's predicated on a stable macro environment and nothing really changing there. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then quickly, any late fee benefit from them, just given the acceleration in credit? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. You do see \u2013 that's part of what gave us better yield than we were expecting. It was relatively flat year-over-year, but better than our expectations. And that's what's pushing our guidance on NIM up from, in January, we were at 15.75% to 16% and now we're saying probably 16% to 16.25% in a quarter for the year. So it's a combination and more revolved on the book. It's one of the natural offsets in the portfolio. So, as credit starts to normalize and trend up, that is one of the natural offsets that you'll see in the business. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. So it's not like pricing for lower quality loans, just some of the natural progression of credit normalizations flowing through there. Got it. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. The FICO strats (49:20) have been very consistent. The Q will come out next week and you'll see that they're virtually unchanged compared to the prior year. We still have 72% of the portfolio with 660 score and above, no change from the prior year, 20% of the portfolio is between 600 to 660 score, no change from the prior year and 8% of the portfolio is below 600 score. So those are all very consistent year-over-year. It really is the dynamics that we've highlighted earlier. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf from JMP Securities. Please go ahead. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I just wanted to follow-up a little more on recovery pricing. In first off, do you enter into forward flow deals with some of the larger debt buyers? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. We do in some cases, David. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. And as we think about \u2013 this may have been asked by a prior caller, but inherent in your forward-looking loss guidance, we would expect as normalization continues the industry as a whole is going to continue to generate more supply. Are you factoring in additional declines in average pricing on charge-off sales or are you basing the assumption that that $50 million was sort of a one-time event? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. The way we book the reserves is you take all the best information that we have at the time, which is current market pricing, any indications that there is a trend there that is going a different way, and we try and build all of that into the reserve model. So I wouldn't call it a one-timer necessarily because it can always change in the future as we move forward. But we've booked our best estimate for what we think the market is priced for today. We've included all of that in our reserves. It will drive \u2013 it's part of what's driving the NCO guidance up a little bit beyond where we were in January, but we've included everything that we're seeing today in the market. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. And when we talk about the market, can you give us a sense for how many sort of approved debt buyers there are on your list versus maybe 12, 18 months ago, because there seems to be a lot of regulatory-driven shake-out in that end of the market and whether that's one of the factors driving the pricing? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. Look, I'm not going to be specific on the number. We've got, I'll call it, a handful of buyers that we've been dealing with for a long time that we're very comfortable with. Our mix changes pretty regularly, depending on the dynamics that we're seeing in the market. I think as I've mentioned in the past, we're always looking at the best ways to optimize the value through sales of the charge-off accounts and then collecting through other means. We always run a regular NPV analysis. And, look, if we start to see pricing deteriorate further, we may take a different approach and we'll make modifications along the way. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. And maybe just lastly, along the same lines, regarding sort of other means, obviously that would be your in-house collection capabilities and potentially outsourcing to contingency collection agencies. Are the settlement terms that maybe you're agreeing to with already written-off consumers changing as well? I just want to understand definitionally if recovery pricing exclusively refers to the price that the debt buyers are paying or if it also implies maybe lower settlement in full terms with the stuff you work out yourself? Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : It's pretty specific to the buyers. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. One question we get a lot is with regard to retailer health. Margaret, you addressed this earlier, but apart from bankruptcies, it seems like retailers are frequently decreasing their storefronts. I was wondering if you could talk to how that impacts the model for Synchrony. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Sure. So we've been seeing this for quite a while. The retailers are going through a transformation. But I would say, as per our reading, it's definitely accelerated coming out of the holiday season. And I think, for us, when we look at this for the retailers that we have, when they're closing stores or reducing their footprint, it's usually stores that are not really generating the sales volume that they need, and it also means that our cards are probably not doing as well in those stores as well. So I think, for us, what we've been able to do, and we show it in the growth that we've been able to achieve in this last quarter, is while they're going through their transformation, we're going through our transformation of making sure we can really attract those customers through the online channels, whether it's through their iPad or on their mobile phone. And, as we indicated in our comments, this quarter, 26% of retail card penetration was online. So we're definitely picking up, I think, more than our fair share of consumers who are not going into the actual physical brick-and-mortar but shopping online. And I think that's really where we have to continue to work with our partners, continue to make sure we have not only the capability, but also the right value props in place, that we're giving the right marketing programs to those consumers to ensure that they're coming back. So we're working hard on those things. We purchased GPShopper. We acquired them this quarter. We did that because they've been able to demonstrate their capabilities in helping us enhance what we're driving for our retailers and also helping some of our retail partners build out their mobile assets. So I think the shift is happening and probably happening at a little more of an accelerated rate this year, but we're on top of it and one that we think we are well-positioned for as that transformation continues to happen. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then, nothing imminent, but I believe you have some significant renewal opportunities next few years. I was just wondering when those conversations typically begin and what the methodology will be to announce or release the status when you have something to say about them. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. So those conversations go on continually, as our retailers are looking for new ways to do things and maybe different kinds of investments or a different value prop. So we're working them all the time, as evidenced by our renewal this quarter of Belk and QVC and Midas. What we would do is, once we close a deal is when we would announce that we won it. But we're working those every day. I think given the state of retail right now, it's incredibly important for us to be the best possible partner we can be for them to really ensure their success and that they feel good about the overall partnership. And hopefully, we're doing that and then we work the renewals into that process as we continue to work closely with them. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Greg Ketron - Synchrony Financial : Okay. Christine, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks and good morning. Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Good morning. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you for all the color on the reserving and kind of what your thoughts are on that. Could you maybe elaborate in terms of within the portfolio if there are any particular parts of it that are normalizing faster than other? I mean, what you're experiencing is something we're hearing from others. So, I guess, I'm interested in knowing if there's something that you're seeing within the context of consumer credit that's beginning to change maybe more rapidly than we had seen in just a few months ago. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. I think it's pretty consistent, Ken. It's driven by the factors that we've talked about in the past. And if you look at our growth rates, everybody has had a different trajectory around growth by a quarter or two, and if you look at ours, our growth rates really accelerated in the second half of 2015 into 2016. And so those vintages are seasoning at somewhat higher delinquency levels. But it's really driven by the fact that we had really strong growth in certain areas of the portfolio that have higher loss rates. When I say areas of the portfolio, I'm really talking about a multi-variant kind of cut where it's a combination of program, channel, platform and product. It's not as simple as just saying it's one program. It's a combination of different things. However, as I mentioned, based on the early read of the most recent vintages, given some of the changes that we made in 2016 and continue to make, they're actually performing a bit better. And that gives us some comfort that this is normalization, and it will level off at some point. We think, for us, based on what we're seeing, that's the back half of 2018. Again, I think it's still important to point out that we're also getting improvement on yields. So we're still seeing pretty good risk-adjusted returns. Once we get past the reserve builds, then include both the growth and the normalization component that we're seeing now, these are going to be very profitable balances going forward once we get beyond that. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I appreciate that. I think one of the challenges that we have in the investment community is, as you see these portfolios and credit cost normalizes, understanding ultimately if that normalization turns into something which we may characterize as deteriorating and as you've kind of mentioned there's been a lot of growth across consumer credit for a lot of companies. And we haven't seen anybody really pull back, and it's \u2013 I guess for those of us who have been around long enough, we kind of recognize that the growth tends to lead to the next credit cycle. It feels awfully close to some previous cycles, and I guess I'm kind of curious as to why we're not seeing more companies pull back before... Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial : Well, I think we're in a good macro environment. I think you got to put the backdrop in there, Ken, which is we're in a fairly good macro environment. The consumers are getting stronger. There's confidence in the consumer. Unemployment is getting better. So I think those things certainly play in to the environment that we're in, and we expect that to continue. I don't think anyone is seeing a big macro correction in that area. So, that helps. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No. I don't disagree with that. I think the problem that we have is that we find that this deterioration is occurring when the consumer is so strong, and that's frankly the problem. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Yeah. I mean, I think part of that, Ken, if you look at the improvement we were getting in 2014 and 2015, it was significantly above our expectations. And if you go back every quarter, we said credit is not going to get better, credit is not going to get better. And I think that was fairly consistent across the industry. And so we saw historic lows for a couple of years, and we're starting to come off of that. It's a fairly gradual change. And if you look at \u2013 for us, I mean I can't speak to others, but our underwriting has been pretty consistent. And I'll walk through the FICO strats (1:01:35) earlier, but for the past few years, they've been very consistent, which says that while there's more supply in the market, we've tried to stay pretty disciplined based on the trends that we're seeing and some of the performance of the vintages from 2015 and 2016. We're making some modifications. But as I mentioned, they're pretty surgical. I think others are probably going to start to do that as well. But I don't think there's anything that we see at least in the consumer that says, by historical standards, there's a problem there. I think they're still healthy. They've continued to take on more debt, more leverage. But, again, if you look at it over time, it still appears to be fairly responsible. And so we're still seeing a lot of opportunities for growth across the credit spectrum. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Well, thank you for all your comments this morning. I really appreciate it. Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial : Thanks, Ken. Unverified Participant : Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. Operator : Thank you.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide an overview of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3. Second quarter net earnings totaled $496 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Consistent execution of our strategy yielded solid performance across our sales platform. Organic growth remains the priority and help to drive double-digit loan receivables and net interest income growth. Additionally, purchase volume was up 6% and average active accounts were up 5% over the second quarter of last year. These metrics are highlighted on Slide 4 of today\u2019s presentation. Our focus on continuing to drive incremental value to our partners and card holders is helping us to generate growth across the business. Particularly, the investments we have been making to extend our digital capabilities are having an impact on our performance. For Retail Card, our online and mobile purchase volume grew 18%, exceeding U.S. growth trends which has been around 14% to 15% and our digital sales penetration was 23% in the second quarter. Moving to credit quality, net charge-offs came in at 5.42% this quarter compared to 4.51% last year. Provision for loan losses was up 30% driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build this quarter 325 million in-line with our expectation. Brian will provide more details on credit later in the call. The efficiency ratio was 30.1% for the quarter versus 31.9% last year as we continue to generate positive operating leverage. An important funding objective for us is expanding our deposit base and we continue to execute strong deposit growth this quarter. Overall, deposits increased $6 billion or 14% to $53 billion. deposits now comprise 72% of our funding sources. Competitive rates and customer service should help us to continue to grow deposits, so I will note that over the longer term we expect for that growth trends to be more in-line with our receivables growth. Regarding capital on liquidity, our common equity Tier-1 ratio was 17.4% and liquid assets totaled $15 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter end. During the quarter we announced a new capital plan that meaningfully increases our capital returns to shareholders. Under the new plan we had increased our dividend to $0.15 per share and can repurchase up to 1.64 billion of our common stock. Looking at the business highlights this quarter, we signed a new partnership with zulily an e-commerce retailer, to launch their first private label credit card program. The launch of the zulily credit card is expected in late 2017 or early 2018. And will provide millions of customers an additional payment options with added value to card holders. Additionally QBC\u2019s card holders will have expanded card utility as they will be able to use their card to make purchases on zulily. We continue to seek new partnerships to augment growth and we are excited to launched our new program with Nissan and Infiniti during the quarter. The new co-branded cars enabled qualified card holders to earn points to the purchase or lease of new or certified pre-owned vehicles. Plan can also be used for the purchase of automotive services and accessories or be redeemed in the form of statement credit. During the quarter, we were happy to a renew existing relationships with MEGA Group USA, City Furniture and National Veterinary Associates. Turning to Slide 5, I\u2019ll spend a few moments on our sales platform performance. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the second quarter. In retail card, we grew loan receivables 10% over last year, reflecting broad based growth across our partner programs. Purchase volume grew 7% and average active accounts growth was 3%. Interest and seasonal loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnership with zulily and the launch of our Nissan, Infiniti program. We have developed strong long-term relationship that solidify our position space, helping us to drive strong organic growth and provide the foundation to the addition of new profitable partnerships. We continue to build out our mobile capabilities and leverage our recent acquisition of GPShopper, who has helped us to develop or Synchrony Plug-In or Sy-Pi capability. Sy-Pi is a native credit feature that plugs into a retailer\u2019s mobile app. It allows retailers credit card holders easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments to their accounts with their smartphones. Though in the early stages 12 of our retailers\u2019 app are utilizing the technology and we have seen a notable increase in usage by card holders. Bill payments have increased significantly, to-date approximately 160 million in payments have been processed through the app. In total, we have had over eight million visits to the plug-in since we launch it. Payment solutions also delivered a solid quarter, broad based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 11%. Purchase volume grew 6% excluding the impact in the loss of sales due to the HHGregg bankruptcy. Average active accounts were up 11% and interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We are pleased to have renewed programs that MEGA Group USA and City Furniture during the quarter. And we continue to enhance our Synchrony Car Care program adding additional utility to nearly three million card holders to excess to more than 185,000 fuel stations nationwide and we continue to extent card we use in payment solutions, which represented 27% of purchase volume in the second quarter. CareCredit also delivered strong quarter, receivables growth of 11% was led by a dental and veterinary specialties, purchase volume grew 11% and average active accounts were up 10%. Interest and fees on loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We recently renewed our relationship with National Veterinary Associates, the largest owner of free standing veterinary hospitals in the U.S. We also announced in a multi-year agreement with Athletico Physical Therapy. This relationship provide patients of athletics over 370 physical and occupational therapy facilities across the country full access to CareCredit\u2019s health, wellness and personal care credit card. We continue to strength in our position in core elective and dental specialties with over 200,000 provider location and over 75% penetration in several key specialties. CareCredit is moving into additional areas including team management, orthopedics, primary care, medical diagnostics and durable medical equipment with nearly 5,000 practices added over the past 12 months. The provider locator has become an important resource for card holders and we are now seeing over 800,000 hits per month. The network expansion and increased use of the card has help drive reuse, which represented 53% of purchase volume in the second quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continue to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I will turn on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter Synchrony earned $496 million of net income which translates to $0.61 per diluted share. We continue to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 12% over last year. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we\u2019ve generated across the business. Purchase volume grew 6% over last year. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth which increased 5% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances and spend with growth in average balance per average active account of 6% compared to last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. While we had strong top-line growth and positive operating leverage in the quarter, which we share with our retailers, RSAs were up only five million from last year. This was due to higher incremental provision expense and loyalty program expense that I will touch on shortly. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.6% for the quarter, down from 4% last year. Given this, we now think RSAs will run closer to 4% for 2017. The provision for loan losses increased 30% over last year, driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build in the quarter was 325 million which was in-line with the expectations we laid out in the first quarter earnings call. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail when we will review Slide eight later. Other income was 26 million lower than the prior year due mainly to higher loyalty expense which increased 71 million compared to the prior year. 37 million of the increase in loyalty expense was largely driven by growth. The remaining 34 million of the increase related to higher redemption rates we experienced over the last few months in one of our programs. This updated estimate relates to rewards that were earned in 2016 through the first quarter of 2017. Adjusting for that, the growth in loyalty program expense was more in-line with our historical run rate. Going forward we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near a 100% with some quarterly fluctuations. And as I noted previously we share loyalty program expense with the retailers through the RSA, and this did lower the RSA level in the second quarter as well as our expectation for the year. Partially offsetting the impact of higher loyalty expense and other income was an $18 million pre-tax gain from a small transaction relating to the sale of merchant acquiring relationships to a third-party during the quarter. Other expenses increased 72 million or 9% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth including strategic investments in our sales pipelines and our direct deposit program as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.1%, nearly a 180 basis point improvement over the 31.9% ratio last year. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage. I will move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trend. Net interest income was up 13% driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.2% up 26 basis points over last year. Compared to last year, there are few key drivers worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a slightly higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we are holding and have deployed excess liquidities to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables was up 15 basis points compared to the prior year. Revolve rate improved compared to the prior year, and we received a modest benefit from the increase in the prime rate over the past year. Lastly funding cost improved by two basis points driven by a slightly more favorable funding mix. Our deposit base increased by $6 billion and with 72% of our funding sources versus 71% a year-ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources, so the margin benefited from this shift and the funding mix to lower cost deposit. So overall we continue to be pleased with our net interest margin performance and given these trends we continue to expect the margin for the full-year to be between 16% and 16.25%. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As we have noted previously, we continue to anticipate credit will normalize from the levels we experienced over the past couple of years, we expect this normalization to occur overtime driven by a number of factors including the portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.25% compared to 3.79% last year, and 90 plus delinquencies were 1.06% versus 1.67% last year. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.42%, compared to 4.51% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCO continues to be normalization. The second quarter of last year also included approximately 15 basis points of benefit from higher recoveries which did not repeat. Given what we have seen so far, we expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for 2017 with normalization being a key driver. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter. It\u2019s important to note that while NCO rate was 5.33% last quarter and 5.42% this quarter, we do see a fairly significant seasonal impact that typically results in a lower NCO levels in the third quarter. The allowance to the loan losses is percent of receivables with 6.63% and the reserve build from the first quarter was 325 million in-line with our expectation. Looking forward, based on what we are seeing across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions are stable, our expectation continues to be a loss rate in the low to mid 5% range for 2018 with lot just trending somewhat higher into the first half of 2018 then starting to level off in the second half of the year. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, given credit normalization and strong growth, we continue to believe the reserve build for the third quarter will likely be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw in the first and second quarter of this year. As we move into 2018, we expect that reserve build will transition to be more growth driven given our expectation that loses began to level off in the second half of 2018. In summary, while credit will continue to normalize form here and impact our near-term operating results, we continue to see very good opportunities for continued growth and attractive risk adjusted return. Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at 911 million up 9% over last year. Expenses continue to be mainly driven by growth and strategic investment. As I noted earlier efficiency ratio is 30.1% nearly 180 basis point improvement over last year as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as our capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by 6 billion, primarily to our direct deposit program. This puts deposit at 72% of our funding slightly higher than the 71% level were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in-line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. We had two very successful debt transactions during the quarter, a 750 million five-year fixed rate senior note issuance and 822 million in ADS issuance, we saw strong demand on both transaction. In terms of our funding plan going forward. We will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017. Funding through securitizations with 17% of our funding consistent with our target of 15% to 20%. Our third-party debt now total 11% of our funding sources within our 10% to 15% target. So overall, we saw very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.2% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 18% on a fully phased-in basis last year reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our previous capital plans and growth. Total liquidity was 21.9 billion, which is equal to 24% of our total assets. This is down from 25.5% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter, we completed the capital plan we announced last July and paid a common stock dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock fulfilling the 952 million in share purchases, our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. In May, were pleased to announce our new capital plan through June 30, 2018. Our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and a share repurchase program of up to 1.64 billion, which we began to execute in May repurchasing 200 million during the quarter in addition to the 238 million repurchase technically to prior program for a total of 438 million of repurchases in the second quarter. This represented 15.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter slightly more than double what we have been averaging in the prior three quarters. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and acquired approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We have built a very strong balance sheet with diversify funding sources, a strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital to the growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view on 2017. Given the strong receivables growth and higher revolve rates we\u2019ve seen so far this year, we continue to believe the margin for the full-year will be in the 16 to 16 and a quarter range, this demonstrates one of the natural offsets in the business, some are the same factors driving credit normalization also resolved in the higher receivables yield. So we are seeing a partially offset on the revenue line. We expect NCOs to be in the low-5% range for the full -year 2017 normalization will continue to be a largest factor. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, given credit normalization and strong growth; we continue to believe the reserves build for the third quarter will likely be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw in the first and second quarter this year. As we move into 2018, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth driven, given our expectation that losses will begin to level off in the second half of 2018. We now think RSAs will run closer to 4% given the impact of reserve build and somewhat higher loyalty program expenses due to higher redemption expectations which are also shared with retailers through the RSA. And while we continue to generate positive operating leverage, it is favorably impacting the efficiency ratio. We expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5% for the full-year. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments as well as holiday marketing campaigns that run in the second half. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer consistent going forward, our expectations that reserve builds will moderate into 2018 which combined with the continued growth of the business and the impact on the substantial increase in our share repurchase program will help us generate EPS growth in 2018. Before I turn the call over to Margaret, I wanted to let you know that we will begin filing an 8-K showing our managed data for delinquencies, net charge-offs and end of period as well as average loan balances on a monthly basis. For the last month of each quarter we will provide the monthly data in conjunction with the filing of our quarterly financial results. We will be filing the first 8-K with this data after the market closes today which will provide you historical monthly information dating back to January of 2015 you can see the monthly trend and in August we will start filing the 8-K in conjunction with our monthly Master Trust filing. I know many of you will find this helpful. And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I will provide a quick wrap up and then we will open the call for Q&A. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities, driving strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms, renewing several existing programs by also signing a new private label credit card program and launching a new co-brand program. We continue to drive solid deposit growth in support of our business development. We are also pleased to have announced a meaningful increase in our capital return to shareholders through our new dividend and share repurchase program. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, not only through dividends and share repurchases but also through the continued growth of our business, with a focus on maintaining strong returns and a solid balance sheet as we do so. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I would like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And we have our first question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you guys could give a little bit more color on what is behind that change that we saw in loyalty rewards expense exceeding interchange this quarter and I had a couple of related follow-ups on that, but perhaps maybe we could start there. Brian Doubles : Yes sure Bill this Brian. Look it is really isolated to one of our programs where we made a couple of changes to make it easier for our customers to redeem their rewards. We believe this is a positive for the consumer to drive more loyalty to the retailer, more visit, more purchases, it\u2019s going to drive incremental sales over the long run. It is again isolated to the one program we highlighted about 34 million of that related to 2016 rewards in the first quarter of 2017. So when you factor in that change, our redemption rate for the total company now is running above 95%. So, even if we were to get to a 100% redemption across the board, when you factor in the RSA offset the future impact will be pretty small. Bill Carcache : Got it, okay. So the redemption rate assumption is 95% even if that went to a 100% that\u2019s not - that would have a material impact? Brian Doubles : It would not have a material impact, the impact would be pretty small just given there is an RSA offset as the partners share in those costs. The best way to think about this going forward, if you adjust for that $34 million in the quarter, loyalty as a percent of interchange was around a 100% and that\u2019s probably a good way to think about it going forward. Bill Carcache : Okay, great and we have kind of spent a lot of time talking about that relationship RSAs and credit and hadn\u2019t necessarily been thinking about RSAs in relation to the reward expense as much, but it sounds like that is a permanent relationship, it\u2019s like loyalty resets permanently higher, I guess is a question is that reasonable to expect that the RSAs will also reset permanently lower? Brian Doubles : That you know, again the RSAs I know keep the like to focus on the RSAs as an offset to credit, we have been pretty clear that the RSAs are really based on the entire P&L, so it includes revenue, it includes loyalty expense, it includes credit, and all that, a couple of cases it includes the reserve build, it includes expenses and so it really is a complete sharing of the entire profitability of the program and so, the RSAs that we saw adjustments to our estimate in the quarter absolutely ramped to the RSA and it was an offset there. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s great, very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Yes thanks Bill. Operator : We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great thanks. I guess first Brian you had mentioned that your expectations for credit losses are pretty much consistent with what you had said three months ago. You had shown us some vintage charge that showed that the second half of 2016 was performing better and can you kind of update that tell us how that\u2019s trending? Brian Doubles : Yes, Moshe. We have only gone here a couple months past when we published us back in April, so I would say the vintages are performing very much in-line with our expectations, we are still seeing the benefit from the underwriting changes that we have made in the second half of 2016 flow through, so we still see that can have a 2016 vintage is better than the first half of 2016. And that\u2019s at least in part what is giving us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the back half of 2018. The underwriting changes that we made in the second half of 2016 and that we have continue to make in the first half of 2017 those are largely going to benefit in the 2018 loss rates. So I would say based on an updated those vintage curves everything we are seeing is pretty much in-line with what we showed you in April. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. just to kind of follow-up on a similar theme, couple of other private label players City and ADS have reported recently. And seem to be, I guess, maybe get your sense as to whether, your results or kind of leading or lagging, because City had kind of taken up its expectation for credit losses, now as oppose to you guys which had kind of done that a few months back and the ADS had talk about some issues with respect to recovery, something that you had also addressed. So maybe just given that everybody is kind of looking at all of the peers, maybe could you put in context kind of the timing of your disclosures. I mean, do you feel like you have been ahead of those factors? Brian Doubles : Yes, I think the general trends are all very similar as you look across issuers. I think credit normalization trends are consistent. But I do think, you are seeing a little bit of variation in terms of which quarter in particular summer starting to see or change our view on the go forward projection. So I think based on - and you can actually, if you go back over the past couple of years and you look at where issuers saw really strong growth, that will differ as well by issuers by a quarter or two. For us, we saw really strong growth in 2015 for first half of 2016. And right now in 2017, we are working our way through the peak kind of loss rates for those vintages. Second half of 2016 will be maturing in the second half of 2018 and so that\u2019s where we will start to see the benefits on the underwriting changes we\u2019ve made. So it\u2019s hard to comment generally, I think the trends across all the issuers are very consistent. But I think everybody is seeing this materialize in maybe a different quarter. Moshe Orenbuch : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. And thank for giving us the monthly data going forward. I guess, first question back on credit quality and maybe following on most of the questions. As far as recoveries are concern. What is the game plan going forward here, because ADS has talked about bringing all that stuff in-house? Could you maybe just talk about where you are at with the recovery game plan? Brian Doubles : Yes. I would say recovery pricing was generally pretty stable this quarter. This is an area that we continue to watch pretty closely. I mentioned last quarter that we run regular analysis on these sales and we compare the results of the debt sales other methods of collecting on the account. So we are always making those trade-off and we are always trying to optimize different strategy. If we start to see the pricing deteriorate further, we may pull back on some of these sales and collect on the accounts for other means but we haven\u2019t made a dramatic shift in our strategy and haven\u2019t reached that decision point yet. But it\u2019s something we evaluate every month internally. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess, following on that, maybe one other question is do you have the capacity to do all of the collections in-house or would that be another step-up in costs to build that out. And then just secondly on RSAs, they are obviously tracking below your guidance for the year and as we sort of calculate what the ROA needs to be, to get to the RSA level that you are guiding to. I mean that would probably represent a pretty decent step up in ROAs for the second half for the year. Is that the way to think about it, I mean it\u2019s like a 30 basis point pick-up in the ROA if I calculate it I think? Or is there something else that we should consider, when we are thinking about the RSA level that you are guiding to for the year? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, let me do the recovery one first. So on recoveries, we would go through a transition period. Day one, we wouldn\u2019t bring it all in-house. We would be thoughtful around how we manage that transition. Obviously there is a short-term implication, there is a long-term implication. You would be a step-up in cost as move some of that in-house or to other collection strategies. But if we felt like that we are getting a good return on our investment over the long-term that\u2019s something we would certainly consider. But we would have to build out some additional infrastructure and add some cost related to that. On the RSAs, I think if you think about where we started the year, we were 3.7 last quarter, we are 3.6 this quarter. You really have to remember that the second half of the year we had a seasonal high, particularly had a seasonal high in the third quarter that typically coincides with the seasonal low point on net charge-off. So this just that dynamic alone as you move from the second into the third and then into the fourth quarter, RSA percentages come up. And we think that puts us back right around 4% for the full-year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just a little bit more clarity on the credit outlook. So if my math were correct gross charge-offs are up roughly 70 bps in the first quarter and may be a little bit below that in the second quarter. As we look out through the back half of the year, should we expect that pace to continue and then some variability on the recoveries and when would you expect us to see the gross charge-offs begin to decelerate and maybe any color you can give us in terms of the 4Q build? Brian Doubles : Yes, so Ryan. Look I think generally the trends like I said are in-line with our expectations. The one thing that you have to factor in, let\u2019s just talk about seasonality for a bit, we do see a fairly significant seasonal drop in NCOs in the third quarter. So you have to make sure that you are modeling that right. That\u2019s certainly included in our guidance. And then just well around the topic of seasonality its probably just worth a reminder that we also see a seasonal increase in delinquencies in the second half of the year. So you just got to make sure that you are taking that all into account, but we feel pretty good about 2017. like I said this is a transition year. This is where we are kind of hitting the peak of the 2015 and first half of 2016 vintages. The underwriting changes that we have made are largely going to benefit 2018. And so that\u2019s really where we are focused. The reserve build in the quarter gives you a fairly good indication that is in-line with our expectations and now we have picked up the first half of 2018, so that should give you some comfort that things are trending more or less in-line with what we expected. Ryan Nash : Got it. Just as a quick follow-up I guess just on a year-over-year basis how should we expect it to trend? And then second just for the NIM, you are obviously running towards the high end of guidance and historically speaking we do see a pickup in the back half of the year as we see lower revenue suppression, an uptick in late fees. If you could maybe just clarify what are some of the offsetting factors that would cause you to not be above the 1625 on NIM? Thanks for taking my question. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. Look other than giving you the full-year and you\u2019ve got the first two quarters to work with, I think that should help you model the third quarter and the fourth quarter pretty closely. I think the thing I just reiterate is you got to factor in the seasonal decrease in the third quarter that comes back up in the fourth. In terms of the margin, look we are very pleased with how we started the year. We are up 26 basis points over last year in the quarter. Receivable yield was up 15 basis points with stronger revolve rate, we got a benefit from the increase in the prime rate, we did have a partial offset from interest and fee reversals which you would expect to see in-line with credit normalization. And then we have done I think a nice job optimizing the liquidity that we are holding on the balance sheet. As you think about the second half for the year, we do typically get a seasonal lift in yield in the second half for the year; however, there is going to be a couple offsets we think. First, I think we will probably see slightly higher deposit betas than we have seen so far in the rate cycle. Nothing dramatic, but probably just a little bit higher than what we have seen so far in the first 100 basis points maybe a little more competition on rates in the second half. And then I think we are also likely to get a little less benefit from higher revolve rate in the second half just getting some of the changes we made on underwriting. So think there will be some puts and takes but that probably puts us back between the 16, 16 and a quarter range for the full-year. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color Brian. Operator : And our next question comes from Beth Lynn Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck : Hi, good morning. On just probably with [indiscernible] you mentioned slightly higher due to the revolve rate you said you expect given your changes that you have slightly lower revolve rate, could you just explain what changes you made to drive to that outcome? Brian Doubles : Well the revolve rate tends to ebb and flow in-line with credit normalization, so we have seen a fairly substantial benefit on revolve rate starting in the second half of last year. We continue to see that through the first half and I think that will just moderate a bit heading into the second half of this year. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck : Okay, and then on the outlook for RSA, I know you had a couple conversations on this already, but question is coming into this quarter you indicated the reserve that you were looking for to hit that, that was great and expecting that reserve build again in 3Q. I understand that the credit improves in 3Q, but should we expect that that there is a like for like improvement in RSA even with what is going to be still a little bit higher reserve build in the third quarter or is there some cushion in the RSA outlook that you are giving us? Brian Doubles : No, we started the year remember around 4.5%, we took it down last quarter to 4.1% to 4.2% and now we are staying around 4%. Part of that is a combination of what we are seeing on credit, plus the additional loyalty costs that we had in the quarter, those are really the two driver. And then how you get from 3.6%, 3.7% range to 4% for the full-year is really seasonality. Go back over the last three years and you look at the increase from the second quarter to the third quarter and then into the fourth you always see an increase in the RSA, some of that is driven by lower net charge offs, some of that is program specific but that increase will be there in the third quarter and we think combination of those things puts us background 4% for the full-year. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck : Okay and then lastly, on the capital return and a dividend hike that you announced earlier this quarter, could you just give us a sense as to whether the timing of your decisions on capital returns has now changed going forward, should we expect that you are going to be making these kind of decisions shortly after second quarter is over timeframe or will you go back to releasing at the same time as the rest of the industry even though you are not CCAR required? Brian Doubles : Yes I mean we were about a month early I think, we got through our process with our board and with our regulators and we were very pleased to be able to announce the capital plan when we did. We were able to take advantage some of that in the quarter. We repurchased about 200 million of the allotment in the quarter. So where we have a little bit of flexibility, we are trying to be opportunistic around that and we will continue to do that. But I don\u2019t think, we are going to be much ahead of timing wise, what we announced this quarter. I think we are still following a very similar process, we are using the same scenarios that gets published early in the year. We run our models, we review it with obviously the Management Team, the Risk Committee and the Board. And our Regulators and this year that put us right around the May timeframe that\u2019s probably not a bad way to think about it going forward, but it could lag a month and we could be close sort of where the peers are in that. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck : Right okay. All right, thanks a lot Brian. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. James Friedman : Hi. Brian I let you take breath and Margaret I was going to ask you couple of questions if I could. Margaret Keane : Brian really appreciates that. James Friedman : I was going to ask you about the Sy-Pi that you had mentioned at the outset. So where should we be seeing that show-up the most significantly, you mentioned a number of retailers that you have that have adopted it, I think you gave another volume based metric. But where in the financials, do you think that that will show up most significantly? And then I have one quick follow-up. Margaret Keane : Sure. You will see that in growth in particularly kind of our mobile growth. So the way the Sy-Pi works, it\u2019s an App that easily integrates to the retailer\u2019s App that\u2019s why we call it plug-in. So it\u2019s very easy to the retailer to execute upon, because most of the work is on our side. And it integrates [indiscernible] so it\u2019s a very seamless smooth process for the customer as they are going through their process of credit and using their credit card and paying and all those types of things getting their reward. So you will see it in growth and our engagement from a mobile perspective just continues to grow and that\u2019s really where you will see that. James Friedman : Okay. Is it fair that say that sort of technology maybe influencing the loyalty observation that you are making more company-wide, if it\u2019s easier to use your rewards people will? Margaret Keane : Not necessary as Brian said there was one program in particular where we need to change. But I would say that in general, the way we think about loyalty is the real positive for us. So the more the customers are aware of the rewards. Our analytic show that if we get them to go back any unused reward, they tend to have a bigger basket and shop more. So for us this circular process of issuing rewards make it easy for the customer, having them go back into our partners to shop is a real class. And as Brian said, the rewards are offset in RSA. So it\u2019s really a win-win for both of us. Right we are helping to generate sales for the customer this higher engagement of that customer with our retailer and in the recent environment we are in, anything we can do to make that customer more sticky is a real positive. James Friedman : Okay. I just had one more. On the digital side, you gave that disclosure, 18% increase, I thought you said online. I get this question a lot is that because you happen to have one extremely prominent ecommerce retailer or is that more of an observation about wallet penetration throughout your retail base? Thank you. Margaret Keane : It\u2019s more wallet penetration across our retail base. I would just generally say, I know everyone looks at the one retailer, but we have a lot of retailers who have online mobile capability and that\u2019s just an area with everything else is growing. So things like having Sy-Pi to help integrate through the App, as I dais we have 12 retailers already involved in that. We are going to continue roll out more, I think you are going to continue to see this be a big part of how customer shop. James Friedman : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Richard Shane : Hey, guys. Actually Jamey\u2019s question was a pretty good segway. I know you are not going to comment too specifically, but can you help us think about any seasonal impacts that we might see in the third quarter results related to Amazon Prime Day, obviously it\u2019s a pretty significant event, I just want to make sure we understand how it runs through the numbers? Margaret Keane : Sure. We can\u2019t really comment on one particular retailer. What I will tell you is that we initiated Amazon 5% off back in second quarter 2015. We are very pleased with the overall programs to-date. It continues a positive growth story for us. And you could read through Amazon had a great day. So we are very pleased with the partnership. Brian Doubles : And you will see it in the third quarter. Richard Shane : Such that might be impacted by that we should be thinking about? Brian Doubles : No Rick I think. Margaret Keane : No, we can\u2019t one partner. Brian Doubles : Look it\u2019s, you will see whatever impact is there in the growth numbers for the company. But I would highlight that we are pretty diversified across all of our retail partners and its where that you would see even and I am as significant as Amazon Prime Day have a dramatic impact on our overall results. Margaret Keane : We have some big partners in that. Brian Doubles : Right. Richard Shane : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-up on credit. One, I know you don\u2019t provide loss data by product, but just curious Payment Solutions continues to be a fastest growing product, it\u2019s over 20% balances now, and those are obviously all promotional balances. Brian, as you look at overall normalization in your commentary about second half 2016 has been performing better than first half. Had there been any meaningful changes in the magnitude of promotions over the last 12, 18 months that maybe impacting the pace of normalization? Just trying to get a sense for whether or not those promotional balances are consisting of the typical interest rate period or whether there were any changes that have contributed to the pace of normalization? Brian Doubles : Yes, no I wouldn\u2019t attribute it to promotional balances. We have seen strong growth in the Payment Solutions, but I would say the trends in Payment Solutions are similar to what we are seeing across the total company in terms of normalization. The one thing I have pointed out in the past is we do underwrite differently by platform, so we are actually slightly more conservative in how we underwrite in Payment Solutions just given if you look at the margins there and the top-line yield, we are working with a little bit less there than we are in CareCredit and Retail Card. So we underwrite a little more conservatively in Payment Solutions, given the margin in CareCredit we will underwrite a little bit deeper. CareCredit and Retail Card is fairly close to the average. So portfolio mix is absolutely a driver, but I would not attribute it to promotional balances. David Scharf : Got it, that\u2019s helpful and then lastly just another quick question on the recovery side. In terms of the mix to the degree of that sales has risen in the last couple of years given pricing trends and those are reversing now has been discussed. How much of your recoveries are actually accomplished through the third channel which is outsource contingency collection, so much is focused on the debt sale side, but are you seeing - A, do use outsource collection agencies and B, are there any changes to the contingency fees, the pricing in that channel? Brian Doubles : Yes, we do use third-parties as well, we try and optimize across all of the recoveries strategies in the various channels and like I said earlier, we are looking at that on a monthly basis. We have run champion challenger to see where we are getting the best results and we modify and adjust the strategies as we go. I would say the majority of the impact that we have seen has largely been attributable to the market pricing on the debt sales and lesser impact in other strategies. David Scharf : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. Brian I believe you indicated, we should expect to see a seasonal drop in charge-offs in 3Q and we certainly saw a significant drop in 2014 and 2015. But last year when delinquencies were actually rising which tends to mute seasonal improvements, you had a much smaller seasonal improvement in the third quarter, was there anything to call out in that that also outside of the rising delinquencies that might have dampened the seasonal improvement that are not present this year and would suggest another kind of large drop in 3Q? Brian Doubles : Yes, it\u2019s a good question Mark. The one thing I would highlight, in the second quarter of 2016 we spiked out of 15 basis points of incremental recoveries that we had in the second quarter of 2016 which obviously didn\u2019t repeat it either in the third quarter of 2016 or repeat this quarter obviously. So that\u2019s one thing I would point to, so maybe take the second quarter of 2016 charge-offs up by 15 basis points and then you would see more of a seasonal decline as you move from the second quarter to the third quarter. Mark DeVries : Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. And then second question, I mean it sounds like you guys have done some pretty meaningful tightening to give you some comfort and the guidance around losses leveling off in the half of last year, but we haven\u2019t really seen that reflected - the growth your loan growth so far. When if it all might we expect to see growth moderate as a result of some of the underwriting moves? Brian Doubles : I think you are seeing I would say to some degree in the purchase volume, we have obviously tightened, we made incremental changes here in the first half, we do expect that to have a modest impact on growth, if you look at purchase volume we were right around 7% when you adjust for HHGregg this quarter versus a run rate that was probably closer to 9% or a little above 9%. So I think that\u2019s where you are seeing it. We are not seeing it quite yet in the receivables still, because there is an offset on incremental revolve which is more of a consumer behavioral element that continues to drive good receivables growth. So we think there is still really good opportunities to continue to grow but I think, we are not seeing the same opportunities to grow that we saw in 2015 and at least in the first half of 2016. So I think, there will be a modest impact going forward. But generally as we look across the programs in the platforms, we are still seeing good growth opportunities that are attractive returns, just maybe not we are seeing couple of years ago. Mark DeVries : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Henry Coffey with Wedbush Securities. Henry Coffey : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And, again, the monthly data is going to be extremely helpful for, so thanks for that step forward. When you talk to about rising net charge-offs, it seem to be either a geographical or channel component to it. There were certain spots to either the store mix or the country that we were struggling more than others. Now that you have had another quarter of looking at that. Can you really comment on two related things one that and two how is the dual purpose card holding up on the credit side? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure. We have highlighted for a number of quarters now that portfolio mix component as part of normalization. For us, as we talked about our underwriting is customized and we underwrite differently whether it\u2019s by platform, by program, we target different loss rates depending on the overall profitability of those programs. So just depending on the growth rates in those different areas mix can certainly be a driver and that\u2019s mix by program, it can be mix by channel, it\u2019s really multi-variant, it\u2019s not as simple as just one program, one product, one retailer, it\u2019s a combination of factors. And I would say, what we are seeing in that regard is largely in-line with our expectation. I wouldn\u2019t attribute it as much to a geographical slice or a geographical split that\u2019s driving, it really is more portfolio mix on our side. And then did you have a second question? Henry Coffey : Yes. Just unrelated, but in terms of margin. I think one everybody heard about asset sensitivity, they were looking for fairly large boost though, now we are seeing fairly small boost. What is the real dynamic there, is it just timing or is it more of funding competitive issue? Brian Doubles : Look, for us, yields and margins are ahead of our expectations so far this year. If you remember, when we started a year back in January, we guided to a net interest margin of 15.75 to 16. We took that up 90 days in. We now think we will be between 16, 16 and a quarter for the year. So we continue to be slightly asset sensitive, its right around 1% under 100 basis points shock. And that\u2019s been very consistent over the last three years. That 1% kind of range hasn\u2019t really moved much. I do think as we get into the second half year that we may see a little more competition on deposit rate. We have seen just in the last four to six weeks, we have seen some competitors move. We have been very fortunate so far with the first 100 basis points. I think on our CDs and savings, I think we haven\u2019t moved more than 10 or 15 basis points across all those products. So we have had a nice little lag her. The margins have improved as a result of it. But I do think the things will get a little more competitive and we are ready to respond to that if we have to. Henry Coffey : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson. Arren Cyganovich : Thank you. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 2019 renewal with your retailers if you have started those discussions and if so how they have been progressing? Margaret Keane : Yes, we really can\u2019t comment on what we have started or not started. But what I would say is we have to win every day, so part of the process we deal here is really making sure we are delivering for the customers and the retailers now. In many cases usually something will come up where the retailers wants to either change the value prop or expand in a certain way which will allow us the opportunities to open up the dialogue. So we are constantly in those discussions and we feel pretty positive about the relationship that\u2019s are coming up. The relationships we have had for very, very long time. And we are hoping and confident that we will be able to renew those relationships. Arren Cyganovich : Fair enough thanks. And then just from a modeling perspective, was the 34 million higher redemption rate that caused the loyalty - is it more of a one-time item, is that something that\u2019s going to be consistent going forward? Brian Doubles : Yes, that\u2019s really more of a one-time item that related to 2016 rewards in first quarter 2017. And in terms of a run rate going forward, if you adjust that to 34 million and put loyalty as a percentage of interchange right around a 100% that\u2019s not a bad way to think about it going forward. Arren Cyganovich : Thank you. Greg Ketron : Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks very much guys. Margaret, you talked about the pipeline in the last question. I\u2019m wondering maybe can you give us kind of just a commentary on any changes I guess to competitive dynamics in the marketplace? Margaret Keane : Yes, sure. I think competitors have been pretty stable as we have gone through this year. I would say, there is not many big deals out there. We tend to compete more on the $1 billion and below in that space, there is plenty of opportunity. We continue to look at existing programs from competitors as well as start-ups. I think I have mentioned in the past we have dedicated resources in all three platforms. So we are feeling pretty good about the pipeline that we have in place and how we are winning and playing in marketplace. We are not going to win every deal. We try to really work on the deals that we think meet our returns and are going to be accretive to our overall portfolio. And that\u2019s kind of how we have approached it and we will continue to approach. But I don\u2019t think anyone seeing particularly crazy out there in terms of competition. John Hecht : Okay, thanks for the color. And then last question is, Brian you talked about deposit data in the second half, maybe just give a little bit more color on that in terms of your outlook and then where are you going on deposit duration just to give us a sense of the pricing changes? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, John. Look I think our expectation is that any move in deposit pricing is going to be pretty modest. I just think it\u2019s been almost non-existent so far with the first 100 basis points that\u2019s going to be slightly above that. We have seen some competitors, we have to figure in a high yield savings with more attractive offers out there, whether it\u2019s the one-time bonus or slightly better rate than they have been offering, and I think we are going to have to step-up our pricing a little bit more in the second half than we did in the first half. But I\u2019m talking about basis points here, not a wholesale change from what we have been seeing. John Hecht : And then duration, where are you guys trying to issue deposit at this point? Brian Doubles : We have always tried to kind of match the duration of our assets with our liabilities that\u2019s part of our funding strategy. We have been very successful in growing the high yield savings book. I would say anywhere where we can grow the longer tenure CDs right now in this environment, we are looking to do that. Obviously given where rates are there is not a lot of demand for a five year CD, where they are priced today. So we are trying to take advantage of that where we can, there is just as not much demand there as we would like to see. John Hecht : Great. Thanks for the color guys. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks John. Margaret Keane : Thank you.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide an overview of the quarter and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I\u2019ll begin on slide three. For the third quarter net earnings totaled $555 million or $0.70 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong growth in several key areas of our business. Loan receivables were up 9%, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth of 11% during the quarter, consistent with our expectations organic growth helped to drive this performance and remains a top priority for our business. Additionally, purchase volume and average active accounts both increased 4% in the third quarter. These metrics are also highlighted on slide four of today\u2019s presentation. Moving to credit quality, net charge-offs were 4.95% this quarter compared to 4.39% last year, provision for loan losses increased 33% driven by credit normalization and growth. Brian will provide more details on credit later in the call. The efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter versus 30.6% last year as we continue to generate positive operating leverage. Our deposit base comprises a significant portion of our funding, 73% in the third quarter. As such, we remain focused on continuing to generate deposit growth. In the third quarter, deposits were up nearly $5 billion over the prior year or 9% to $54 billion. Competitive rates and customer service should help us to drive further deposit growth, and we expect for that growth to generally trend in line with our receivables growth. Regarding capital and liquidity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 17.3% and liquid assets totaled $16 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. During the quarter, we paid a $0.15 dividend per share and repurchased $390 million of our common stock. Looking at the business highlights, we renewed several partnerships this quarter, including Yamaha, BrandsMart U.S.A., Nautilus, Mars Petcare and Evine. We continue to seek new partnerships to augment our strong organic growth. During the quarter we launched new programs with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products and Zulily, an e-commerce retailer. Furthermore, with the launch of Zulily, our QVC cardholders now enjoy expanded card utility as they are also able to use their QVC cards to make Zulily purchases. We also launched a new value proposition at PayPal that offers cardholders 2% cash back on their online and in-store purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted, and to make the card convenient and simple to use, all accounts are automatically added to members\u2019 PayPal Wallet and cash rewards are redeemed directly to PayPal balances. We recently announced the rollout of our new CareCredit Dual Card, the CareCredit Rewards MasterCard. The card is being offered as an upgrade to select cardholders among our 10 million plus nationwide cardholder base. This new card combines the promotional credit capabilities of the standard CareCredit card with the added convenience of MasterCard acceptance. The CareCredit Rewards MasterCard remains focused on health, wellness and personal care, while offering cardholders the ability to earn points for all purchases, including CareCredit network and general purchases. Turning to slide five, I\u2019ll spend a few moments on our sales platform performance. We continued to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter. In Retail Card, we grew loan receivables 9% over last year, reflecting broad-based growth across our partner programs. Purchase volume grew 4% and average active account growth was 3%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. As I noted earlier, we had another active quarter in our Retail Card sales platform with the renewal of our Evine partnership, the launch of our At Home and Zulily programs, and the rollout of our new value proposition at PayPal. We continue to leverage our strong Retail Card foundation and make investments to drive organic growth and attract profitable new programs. Payment Solutions also delivered a solid quarter. Broad-based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 9%. Purchase volume grew 6%, excluding the impact from the loss of sales due to the HHGregg bankruptcy. Average active accounts were up 9%, and interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We are pleased to have renewed several key Payment Solutions programs during the quarter, including Yamaha, BrandsMart U.S.A. and Nautilus, and we continue to enhance our Synchrony Car Care program, recently adding additional utility to nearly 3 million cardholders with the addition of Mavis Discount Tire to the Synchrony Car Care network. Payment Solutions reuse rates represented 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Purchase volume and average active accounts were both up 9%. Interest and fees on loans also increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We recently renewed our partnership with Mars Petcare, a global leader in pet care. We also entered the durable medical equipment market with new multiyear partnership with several personal mobility companies. This new market aligns well with our objective of helping people pay for care when they need it. And as I outlined earlier, we recently launched our new CareCredit Dual Card, further expanding the utility and convenience of the card. We will continue to seek ways to expand the utility of our CareCredit Card. Our network expansion and increased card utility has helped drive reuse, which represented 54% of purchase volume in the third quarter. Our sales platform delivered solid results and continue to develop, extend and deepen relationships, while providing innovative value-added solutions for our partners and cardholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on slide six of the presentation. In the second quarter Synchrony earned $555 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share. We continued to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 9% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 11% over last year. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business. Purchase volume grew 4% over last year. The slower growth compared to recent quarters was due to a few factors. The underwriting refinements we have noted previously, impact from the hurricanes during the quarter and the HHGregg bankruptcy. Given some of these items are short-term in nature, we would expect the impact to moderate in future quarters. We had another solid quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 4% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances with growth and average balance per average active account up 6% compared to last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. RSAs increased 6%, while we share the strong topline growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was partly offset by higher incremental provision expense, RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.2% for the quarter, down from 4.3% last year and in line with our expectations. For the year we still think RSAs will run near 4%. The provision for loan loss increased 33% over last year driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build in the quarter was $360 million, which included the impact from areas affected by the recent hurricanes and a slight reduction in expected recovery sales going forward. Adjusting for those items, the reserve build was largely in line with the previous two quarters and the expectations we laid out earlier in the year. I will cover asset quality metrics in more detail when we review slide eight later. Other income was $8 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $10 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $99 million or 12% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms, in our direct deposit program, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter, compared to 30.6% last year and year-to-date the ratio is 30.3%, around a 70 basis point improvement over the 31% ratio year-to-date last year. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage. I\u2019ll move to slide seven and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 11% driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.74%, up 40 basis points over last year. While we generally see margin performance improvement in the third quarter due to a higher revolve rate, the margin performed better than expected driven by a few factors. First, we benefited from a slightly higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we\u2019re holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables was up 14 basis points compared to the prior year. The revolve rate increased slightly compared to the prior year and we received a modest benefit from the increases in the prime rate over the past year. Funding costs increased 8 basis points driven by higher rates in our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to higher benchmark rates. Since the fed started tightening, we had benefited as our yield on earning assets have outpaced the increase in funding cost, leading to the margin outperforming our expectations. Part of this benefit can be attributed to lower deposit rate betas than we were expecting through the first 100 basis points of tightening. We did see deposit rates move more in the last tightening, and we believe if rates continue to rise our deposit betas will increase to keep pace with future rate and deposit market increases. We also expect to see the normal seasonal decline in yield in the fourth quarter given the build in receivables during holiday season. This has been as much as 50 basis points to 60 basis points historically. As a result, we expect the net interest margin to trend closer to 16.25% in the fourth quarter, still well above our original outlook. Next, I will cover our key credit trends on slide eight. As we have noted on our previous calls, credit began to normalize in mid-2016 and we have expected this normalization to occur over time driven by number of factors, including portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors. As a result, we have needed to increase the level of reserve builds over the last quarters and as expected, this continued during the third quarter. But going forward, we believe the receive builds needed will be lower as the pace of credit normalization slows, assuming the current economic trends continue. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, I will start with the delinquency trends, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.8%, compared to 4.26% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.2% versus 1.89% last year. Moving on to net charge-offs, the net charge-off rate was 4.95%, compared to 4.39% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. Given what we\u2019ve seen so far, we continue to expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for 2017, however maybe at the higher end of the range depending on the impact from the hurricanes. It\u2019s important to note that we do see a fairly significant seasonal impact that typically results in higher NCO levels in the fourth quarter. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.97% and the reserve build from the second quarter was $360 million. As I noted earlier, this included the impact related to areas affected by the recent hurricanes and a slight reduction in expected recovery sales going forward. Adjusting for those items, the reserve build was largely in line with the previous two quarters and the expectations we laid out early in the year. Looking forward based on what we are see across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions are stable, our expectation continues to be a loss rate in the low-to-mid 5% range for 2018, with losses trending somewhat higher into the first half of \u201818, then starting to level off in the second half of the year. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth driven, given our expectation that losses begin to level off in the second half of \u201818. We believe the reserve build in the fourth quarter will begin to reflect this and we expect the build to be in the $275 million range. I\u2019d also like to provide an update on underwriting and vintage performance, which continues to trend in line with expectations. As you remember, we started making refinements to our underwriting in the second half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the early data suggest that the 2017 vintage is performing better than the second half of \u201816 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of change and impact on our results will moderate as we move into 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see very good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Moving to slide nine, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $958 million, up 12% over last year. Expenses continue to be primarily driven by growth. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% year-to-date, around a 70-basis-point improvement over last year, as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, while continuing to fund our strategic investments. Moving to slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by nearly $5 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 71% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Going forward, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix going forward. Funding through securitizations was 16% of our funding, consistent with our target of 15% to 20%. Our third-party debt totals 11% of our funding sources within our 10% to 15% target. So, overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.3% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.2% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.9% on a fully phased-in basis last year over a 70-basis-point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth. Total liquidity was $22 billion, which is equal to 24% of our total assets. This is down from 27% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased $390 million of common stock during the third quarter. We have approximately $1 billion remaining in potential share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our Board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2018. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions, and required approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We build a strong very balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I wanted to recap on our current view for the year. First, on the net interest margin, while we believe the margin trend is closer to 16.25% in the fourth quarter as we expect to see higher deposit betas and the seasonal decline in yields, we are still trending above the original outlook we provided back in January. The margin performance does demonstrate one of the natural offsets in the business. Some of the same factors driving credit normalization also result in a higher receivables yield, so we are seeing a partial offset on the revenue line. We continue to expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for the full year 2017. Normalization continues to be the largest factor and the impact from the hurricanes may nudge this to the higher end of the range. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds begin to transition to be more growth driven in 2018. We believe the reserve build in the fourth quarter will begin to reflect this and we expect the build to be in the $275 million range. We continue to think RSAs as a percent of receivables will run near 4% for the year, given the impact of reserve build and somewhat higher loyalty program expenses, which are also shared with retailers through the RSA. Turning to expenses. We continue to generate positive operating leverage and now expect the efficiency ratio to be slightly lower than the 31% for the full year, ahead of our original outlook. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, that will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, as well as holiday marketing campaigns that will continue in the fourth quarter. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns, assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer are consistent going forward, our expectation is that reserve builds will moderate into 2018, which combined with continued growth of the business and the impact from the substantial increase in our share repurchase program will help us generate EPS growth in 2018. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll provide a quick wrap up and then we\u2019ll open the call for Q&A. We remain focused on our strategic priorities, working daily to drive organic growth, deliver value to our partners, attract new profitable programs and make the investments necessary to develop innovative solutions that help our partners address the evolving retail landscape. When our partners win, we win. Our results this quarter including the numerous renewals and program launches demonstrate our commitment to our partners and cardholders, and the value they derive from our products and services. Returning capital to shareholders also remains a key focus and we are pleased to have increased our dividend payout this quarter and to repurchase $390 million of our common stock. And we are doing this as we continue to grow our business, while maintaining strong returns and a solid balance sheet in the process. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up to Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I wanted to ask a question on, follow-up on your commentary around credit. The year-over-year increase in delinquency rates has been pretty flat since June at around 50 basis points. Is it reasonable given all of your commentary around your normalization and growth driven kind of all those dynamics to think of that 50 basis points as peak-ish or is there room for that to accelerate from here? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Bill, I think, really what you\u2019re seeing is the delinquency related to both the second half of \u201815 vintage in the first half of \u201816 vintages mature. They\u2019re right at the point right now about 18 months out where they hit the peak delinquencies. And so if you think about the benefits from the underwriting changes that we made, those are just now starting to work their way through the portfolio. And so you\u2019ll start to see those in the overall delinquency stats probably in the call it the first half of 2018 about six months in advance of net charge-offs leveling off, which we think happens in the back half of 2018. So I\u2019d say delinquencies are trending in line with our expectations and again, just really driven by the normal seasoning pattern in those second half of \u201815, first half of \u201816 vintages. Bill Carcache : Okay. If I may follow up, I had a bigger picture question for you, Margaret. Some of the larger bank issuers who have been a bit more aggressive on pricing appear to be facing a little bit of, I guess, pressure to deliver better operating performance within their card segments and arguably that would seem to diminish their ability to more aggressively go after some of your partners perhaps by leading with pricing. Just curious, are you seeing any signs of dialing back competitive pressures? Just trying to get a sense overall in the context some of the renewal risk that that investors are concerned about in terms of what you\u2019re seeing. Margaret Keane : Yeah. So I\u2019d say we haven\u2019t really seen a change in the competitive landscape. I think pricing is really one piece of the puzzle. The things that our partners really focus on is capabilities first, and then, obviously, once you get into that process then pricing becomes the end discussion. So we\u2019re working hard to ensure and you see that in some the things we talked about earlier around our investments and how we\u2019re trying to really work to innovate what our partners really need. So I\u2019d say no real change that we\u2019re seeing right now and we\u2019re just focused on keeping our head down, and really trying to deliver for our partners as we go through this large retail transformation that\u2019s occurring. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. I just want to talk a little bit about the implications of the tighter underwriting. Certainly, we understand that from a credit perspective, but I am curious how it impacts the revolve rate and then given the lower contribution from interchange on your model, how should we think about low -- potentially lower revolve rate on the economics of that business? Brian Doubles : Yeah. I think, Rick, it\u2019s a great question. I think you\u2019re going to see the impact of the tighter underwriting in a couple areas. I think we\u2019ve seen a modest impact when it comes to purchase volume. You can see that -- we saw that trend a little bit last quarter, a little bit more this quarter. Obviously, that\u2019s where you feel the impact, I guess, more immediately. I think, longer-term and I would expect to start see a little bit of this in the fourth quarter. We would expect to see a little less benefit from revolve. I think we\u2019ll still see good revolve rate on the portfolio. That\u2019s the business that we\u2019re. That\u2019s what drives our earnings. I don\u2019t view this as a fundamental change. But if I think about the significant lift in our margins that we got really starting second half of last year also this year, I think, that\u2019s going to start to wane a bit, and I think, you\u2019ll start to see a little bit of that in the fourth quarter and a little bit more of that probably in 2018. Rick Shane : Great. Very helpful. Thanks, Brian Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll appreciate you are showing some operating leverage with the efficiency ratio falling. At this point you are two years completely independent and well into your bank buildout. I have a question here, are there opportunities to really further your efficiency improvement as you do have peers who have grown expenses less substantially and been able to use expense days as a way -- to -- as a lever to try to offset the credit impact? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Sure, Mark. Look, we\u2019re very focused on productivity and I think so far year-to-date we\u2019ve driven about 70 basis points on the efficiency ratio from 31% last year down to 30.3% so far year-to-date. So we are generating good operating leverage in the core business. We\u2019re obviously using some of those productivity savings to increase the spend on our strategic investments. Certainly, revenue and margin has trended above expectations so far this year, so that\u2019s helping us a bit. If you go back and you take a two-year look, the efficiency ratio in 2015 was 33.5% and we\u2019ve driven that to just below 31% in two years. That feels like a fair amount of operating leverage for us to be generating while funding all of our strategic investments. So, what I would tell you that the huge focus of the management team, we\u2019re always looking at ways to get more efficient in the areas that don\u2019t directly impact our partners and our customers, cutting waste out of the business and then taking those savings, and obviously, showing some productivity, but also driving those savings back into strategic investments that are going to pay off two years, three years, four years, five years down the road Mark DeVries : Okay. Are you able to give us some sense of what we should expect maybe in 2018 in terms of strategic investments? Brian Doubles : It\u2019s going to be along the same lines as the stuff we invested in this year. We\u2019re spending on digital, mobile. We\u2019re spending a lot on analytics. All the things that are helping us really outperform what has been a fairly weak retail environment right now. These are the things, as Margaret talked about, were -- it\u2019s really important for us to help our retailers as we go through this transformation. So we need to be kind of investing ahead of the curve in order to sustain the type of growth that we\u2019ve had. Mark DeVries : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi. Good morning. Brian, a quick question on portfolio acquisition appetite, where are you on that and last night on the PayPal call, they mentioned that they might sell their portfolio by year end. Is that something that you would be interested in? Margaret Keane : So I\u2019m going to take that one, if it\u2019s okay. We -- look, we showed this quarter that we\u2019re interested in winning deals. We\u2019re obviously very interested in winning deals. I can\u2019t really comment on a particular portfolio that\u2019s out in the marketplace. However, we\u2019re really always open to attractive opportunities that meet our return hurdles, that are strategic for our business, that allow us the opportunity to continue to grow. So we\u2019re continuing to work hard on our pipeline, looking at various opportunities across all three of our platforms and we\u2019re going to continue to drive that through this year and into next year. Don Fandetti : And Margaret on that same note, would you be willing to lend in international markets if one of your partners was interested in that? Margaret Keane : We\u2019d have to -- yeah, I think, the answer is, we would be interested. We\u2019d have to really figure out how we would structure that. It\u2019s a -- It gets a little more complicated from a funding perspective when you\u2019re outside the U.S. So we\u2019d have to figure that out. But, obviously, we\u2019re always talking to people about different opportunities and we would continue to work with our partners to establish something that they felt strongly about. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good morning, guys. Brian, you gave us updated guidance for the 4Q reserve build of $275 million. A lot of the big banks this quarter were willing to tease out for us, what specifically in terms of reserve build was related to growth and what was related to higher charge-offs. So I was hoping maybe you could give us some color on that as you think about the 4Q reserve build. And two, as we start to see the headwinds from reserve building related to credit starting to subside over the next couple of quarters, what does this mean for the RSA over time? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Sure, Ryan. So, the reserve build -- the primary components are the same, credit normalization and strong receivables growth. If you break it down more specifically, think about approximately $20 million was related to hurricanes and recoveries, the two items that we spiked out individually for you guys, and then the balance of $340 million was really split roughly 50-50 between growth and normalization. So if you adjust for the two specific items, the build was pretty much in line with the prior two quarters, also in line with the outlook that we gave you back in April. So, I think, as you alluded to more importantly, just based on the trends that we\u2019re seeing and the impact of the underwriting changes that we\u2019ve made, we think the reserve will start to moderate beginning in the fourth quarter and then trend from there as we head into 2018. Obviously, we\u2019ll give you a more complete outlook when we do our January call. Ryan Nash : And then, I guess, just wasn\u2019t made for the RSA as credits starts to normalize? Brian Doubles : Yeah. As you think about the RSA, we trended well below our original expectation. If you remember back in January, we thought the RSA would be around 4.5%. We\u2019re now seeing it somewhere in the 4% range, so there\u2019s 50 basis points of an offset there versus our original expectations. You\u2019ll start to see a little bit higher RSA starting in the fourth quarter. So with the reserve build trending down to the $275 million range versus where it\u2019s been all year, the benefit of that lower build will obviously be shared with the retailers, so you\u2019ll see a little bit of higher RSA in the fourth quarter. That brings us back to that kind of 4% level and then we would expect that trend to continue into 2018. Ryan Nash : And just last follow up, Brian. On the 50-basis-point quarter-over-quarter NIM decline, obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces within that. But could you just help us understand what\u2019s baked in, in terms of expectation for higher funding costs and revolve rate. Obviously, the market\u2019s expecting another rate hike until the end of the quarter. Would you expect to see the deposit pricing continue to increase even though we\u2019re not going to see a rate hike until the back half of the quarter? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Yeah. Let me give you a couple pieces as we think about the fourth quarter. So, first, as you mentioned, the most significant impact is just normal seasonality. So when you get that big seasonal build in receivables, you typically see a decline in yield as you move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. That spend is much as 50 basis points to 60 basis points if you go back historically and look at it. And then, I think, you\u2019ll have a couple of smaller impacts. I do think we\u2019ll see slightly higher deposit betas than we\u2019ve seen so far in the rate cycle. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything dramatic, but it\u2019s probably a little more competition than what we saw all year. We start to see a little bit of that in the kind of latter half of the third quarter. I think that will continue into the fourth and into 2018. So far we\u2019ve outperformed our expectations when it comes to deposit betas, I think we\u2019ll just give a little bit of that back, so that\u2019s in the forecast for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll also have a slight impact from some of the relief related to hurricane impacted areas. We think that will be pretty small but that\u2019s included there as well. So I think you\u2019ve got seasonality is the big driver and then you\u2019ve got a couple of other small things that will work their way through in the fourth quarter. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Just wanted to follow up on the NIM related to the forward look here, I think, you mentioned that the improvement waned a little bit, but does that because funding cost is going up or you\u2019re not passing along as much of the rate hike in yields? Brian Doubles : Well, if you\u2019re talking specifically in the fourth quarter, it really is just seasonality. As you start to look seasonality and the two either items I mentioned, deposit betas being a little bit higher and a little bit of relief impact from the hurricanes. So those are kind of the specific dynamics for the fourth quarter. And then the one, I think, just to contemplate for -- as we move into 2018, in response to some of the underwriting changes we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ll probably have a little less benefit from higher revolve rate. So if you think about the second half of last year all through this year, we got a pretty substantial benefit from higher revolve. And I think that will just wane a little bit in line with credit starting to level off in the back half of \u201818. So those two things are obviously very linked and so we would expect to see a little less revolve as we move forward into \u201818. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then, just on this quarter and 3Q, I was wondering if there was any forbearance activity or delayed payments that you might have done for people in hurricane-related areas. I know a couple of peers mentioned that, so I was just wondering if that impacted NCOs as well this quarter? Margaret Keane : Yeah. So, I\u2019d say, I\u2019ll start, I think, one of the things that we have to make sure, particularly in the space that we\u2019re in, because our customers, our customers and the retailers, we really have to be thoughtful about the impact on them, because our goal is always to make them feel like we\u2019re caring about them, we\u2019re listening to their needs. So we have taken a number of actions to ensure we\u2019re addressing the customer needs and Brian could you just talk about the financial impact of that. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Sure, Betsy. I\u2019d say, overall, it\u2019s a pretty modest impact on the business. Obviously, starting with purchase volume, obviously the areas impacted by the hurricanes that resulted in some lost sales relative to our forecast. Wasn\u2019t that material, but obviously something we expected to see. I think over the longer term, we would expect to see an increase in certain spend categories as people start to rebuild. We\u2019re obviously waiving certain fees and charges in the impacted areas. That had about a 10-basis-point impact on margins, so it\u2019s pretty small. We\u2019ll likely have another similar impact in the fourth quarter. And then just in terms re-aging balances, because I know this has been a topic, we do waive minimum payments to give some customers additional time to pay, but we typically don\u2019t move deeply delinquent accounts back to current, just given the odds of collecting on those accounts are very low to begin with. So there really wasn\u2019t a benefit on net charge-offs due to hurricanes in the quarter for us, just based on our policies. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So no impact on net charge-offs for you? Brian Doubles : No. Not in the quarter. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Brian Doubles : We do expect to have a little bit of an increase in net charge-offs, obviously, as we move into the fourth quarter, that was -- we recorded that in the reserve build this quarter. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Here\u2019s first question. I just wanted to clarify the RSA commentary Brian that you had. As we look out to next year, I mean, should we expect it to sort of migrate back to the mid-4%s or are you saying that the trendline is in the low 4%s? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Sanjay, that\u2019s probably more specific than we want to get on 2018 at this point. But what I\u2019d tell you is we think it\u2019s 4% for the year. It\u2019s going to come up a bit in the fourth quarter and then we do expect the reserve builds to moderate, and if the reserve builds moderate, we would expect the RSAs to be higher than they were this year. So I\u2019m not going to give you\u2026 Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Brian Doubles : \u2026a specific number but higher than 4%. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. And then, I guess, Margaret, obviously, you guys have a couple of large renewals out in 2019 and the dialogue is ongoing there. But, I mean, maybe you could just give us some preliminary window sort of into the nature of the discussions and how comfortable you feel on the renewals there? And then just maybe broader question, it\u2019s been about three years since you guys have gone public and the complexion of the business is pretty much the same in terms of the mix of business. I mean, I know the other segments have been growing quite nicely. I mean are there any other expansion opportunities, maybe going back to some of the international opportunities that were brought up before? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Sure. So, on renewals, I think, I\u2019ve said this, we are trying to renew every day, right. It\u2019s really a function of partnering with our retailers and making sure we are meeting their needs on an everyday basis. We do have some renewals coming up. We feel very confident that we\u2019ll be able to renew those relationships. We\u2019re working hard to make sure the dialogues happening in the right areas and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to announce some things next year. And then the second question. I\u2019d say two things. It\u2019s -- we always look at opportunities that are outside the U.S. I think it really becomes a question of -- growth -- is it enough, where there\u2019s enough growth. We have to think about funding, as I said. We have to think about more regulators to our mix. So we want to make sure we\u2019re not overstretching ourselves from a regulatory point of view. I think what we\u2019re really focused on right now is really looking at what I would call more opportunities to do some tuck-ins where it makes sense, an example is, we purchased GPShopper, as an example. That\u2019s been a really nice acquisition for us in terms of, one, building out our capability and some of the things we\u2019re doing from a mobile perspective, but I think also helping some of our partners build out their mobile capability. And I think you\u2019ll see us doing things more like that in each of our platforms as we go into 2018. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered, just wanted to follow-up on a couple of areas. One is, on -- Brian, on the reserve build. I mean, you talked about it moderating. I guess, when we think about, when you\u2019re thinking about that reserve level, like, what do you need to see for it to kind of get back substantially closer to just providing for growth, I mean, is it that delinquencies have then -- have -- is it that early part of \u201818 where the delinquency -- you expect the delinquencies to kind of start to improve or do the actual charge-offs have to start to improve? Brian Doubles : Yeah. No. It\u2019s a good question, Moshe. And obviously, picking an individual quarter where this is going to occur is somewhat challenging. But I think the easiest way to think about it is, when credit is exactly flat in your 12-month outlook, then your reserve build should be pretty much just growth related. Now that\u2019s easier said than done, because you\u2019re always putting on new vintages. Those vintages are seasoning, so you\u2019ve always got a component of normalization or vintage seasoning in your reserve. And so that\u2019s why what I think is a better expectation for all of you to have is that you start to see a modest decline in the reserve builds off of the current trend, right. So going from a core reserve build of around $340 million to something more in the $275 million range next quarter indicates some level of improvement in that forward-looking view on losses. To the extent that that outward view, that 12-month view continues to improve and stabilize, then you would expect to see the trend in reserve builds kind of follow along the same lines. So I know that\u2019s not a specific answer on which quarter. What we have is a combination of what you\u2019re seeing in the delinquency content, what you\u2019re seeing in the vintage seasoning and then what is -- what does all that mean for your 12-month forward view on losses. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. And kind of to follow-up on Sanjay\u2019s question on the renewals. What -- I guess what -- could you just talk a little bit about how you would get some of your major partners to kind of renew early, perhaps not going to RFP and how your experience in 2000 debt around the time of the announcement of the IPO reflected those renewals and any changes that had to be made and how we could apply that? Margaret Keane : Right. So -- yeah, so, I would say, when -- our toughest renewal period was right before the IPO, because we went out and made sure we renewed all of our contracts so that when we came out to the IPO we had some stability in our portfolio. I think what generally happens is, the retailers looking for something whether it\u2019s a new value prop, a new innovation or something that is important to them and it gives us an opportunity to open the dialogue up to say, okay, we can invest XYZ. We\u2019ll put more in this particular area but we\u2019re going to need an extension. That\u2019s usually how that happens. There are cases for some retailers where there\u2019s a requirement as part of their policy that they do have to RFP. So in some cases we just have to go through that process. But, again, I feel like we have very good relationships right now. Our partners need us probably more now than ever given the transformation that\u2019s occurring in retail. I think the strategic investments that we\u2019re making are really, really important. Having the digital seamless process for the customer, as well as really leveraging and being more real-time as we\u2019re trying to work towards data, I think, are two really, really important initiatives for us to really help our partners as they go through that transformation. I think one positive we have is, we can see the transaction wherever it\u2019s happening, right, whether it\u2019s on a mobile phone, online or in the store, and we can see how that customer is shopping. And what we really want to get to is an ability to really integrate kind of the point-of-sale experience with big data and make that real-time. And there\u2019s a lot of work going on right now to really try to work hard to get that to happen. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks guys very much and good morning. Brian Doubles : Hey, John. Margaret Keane : Hi, John. John Hecht : I think most of my questions have been asked. I guess you guys have talked about a weak retail environment, and Margaret, you just talked about the digital component. I mean, could you give us maybe an update on some of your e-commerce factors, maybe penetration of total flow of volume or growth rates year-over-year in that regard? Margaret Keane : So year-over-year our online sales were up about 16% and if you look at our Retail Card where we have good measures, our sales penetration is 24%. So we continue to feel really positive about our ability to grow that channel. And again, I think, what we\u2019re really trying to do is roll out and we\u2019re in the midst of doing some of this, some enhanced capability to our partners to make that process from applying and servicing on your mobile phone much more seamless. I think many of you heard last year we had SyPi, which is a plug-in app that we do with our retails. We\u2019re rolling that out as an example more effectively across all our big retailers. So we see this as a continued really important opportunity for us. And I think similar to what I said on the last question, when you integrate that with really the data, I think, that\u2019s really where we\u2019ll have a real win and we\u2019re working it to try to get that information to be real-time and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on right now. John Hecht : Okay. And turning to another growth endeavor, you\u2019re looking at the stats the quarter. CareCredit continues to be a platform that you have shows pretty strong growth and I know you guys bought a portfolio from a competitor last year. Have -- maybe can you give us an update on that, what\u2019s the penetration rate in terms of the, I guess, the partners, the medical partners in that concept and what\u2019s the opportunity set going forward? Margaret Keane : Yeah. I think, what we\u2019re trying to do here is really look at CareCredit. I think, we have very high penetration in the verticals that we\u2019ve been in for a while whether essential to that very high penetration of the partners. What we\u2019re really looking at right now is and you\u2019re seeing that in the growth is expanding into new verticals where we see an opportunity. When we do the verticals, one of the things we want to make sure, we never want to be in a position where if this is all not done where someone\u2019s in surgery or something like that, we\u2019re doing it outside, any of those types of areas. But one of the things, I think, you\u2019re seeing is health care costs continue to go up. I think CareCredit is offering an opportunity to our customers to leverage and use some of our promotional financing to take care some of their very important health care needs and wellness needs. So, I think, we\u2019re really excited about how we\u2019re going after these verticals and driving that growth. And then, lastly, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve been in Rite Aid testing CareCredit as the utility card across some other areas and that\u2019s an example where we\u2019re seeing nice growth as well. So we\u2019re continuing to look at what are the right areas to continue to expanding in CareCredit. I will tell you that the customers love that product. We have very high brand recognition. It\u2019s a great little platform for us and one that we\u2019re going to continue to invest heavily and really drive growth. John Hecht : Thanks very much. Appreciate the color. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. We ended 2017 with a solid fourth quarter, which sets the foundation for 2018. Tax reform had an impact on our reported fourth quarter results, which Brian will cover later in the call. We expect to realize significant benefit from tax reform and we will look to utilize this benefit in a way that drives value for our shareholders, employees and communities. I\u2019m going to spend my time today covering our business highlights, including the expansion of the strategic credit relationship with PayPal, as well as what we achieved in 2017, and I will end with our strategic priorities. Brian will detail our financial results and our outlook for 2018 later in the call. A very significant and exciting development in the fourth quarter was the agreement we announced with PayPal to significantly expand and extend our strategic consumer credit relationship. In addition to extending our co-branded consumer credit card program with PayPal, we will now become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. This will consolidate PayPal\u2019s two U.S. credit offerings under one relationship, which we extended with PayPal for 10 years. As part of this transaction, we will be acquiring PayPal\u2019s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, as well as interest held by other investors. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year. Moving forward with PayPal to become the exclusive issuer of PayPal Credit in the U.S. is a natural extension of our successful 13-year relationship. The extended program offers tremendous benefits for both Synchrony and PayPal. Together, we can deliver best-in-class experiences for credit customers. Combining our program management, credit capabilities and balance sheet with PayPal\u2019s data and risk platform and trusted brand as a leader in digital and mobile payment experiences should help create superior products and offerings for consumers and merchants. The two programs require our unique organizational focus, given that they address different customer needs, rewards for co-brand and financing for PayPal Credit two areas in which we have expertise. Also, having one partner to holistically manage both of these programs for PayPal will allow for synergies and could provide opportunities for migrating customers between products as their needs change. Our strategy will focus on optimizing three main components to drive sustained growth : the consumer value proposition, merchant differentiation and world-class digital customer experience to support ongoing engagement. This expanded relationship supports our continued reach within the rapidly growing digital payments channel. We have built a strong reputation in this space and this program will allow us to meet evolving consumer needs. We primarily compete on our capabilities, including our significant experience, scale, dedicated teams, data analytics, loyalty programs, digital capabilities and proven record of providing value-added services to our partners. These capabilities all played an important role in expanding our relationship with PayPal. We have a long history and have worked closely with them during our tenure to develop innovative and effective products and value propositions for PayPal\u2019s customers. We are obviously very pleased to be extending this important relationship as we jointly leverage the new opportunities to significantly grow this program. During the fourth quarter, we renewed several relationships, including Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Retail Card, Home Furnishings Association, Husqvarna Viking, and Sweetwater and Payment Solutions and Bosley and Sono Bello and CareCredit. This was obviously a very productive quarter for us and we are pleased to continue to generate growth, both organically and through the launch of new innovative programs with exciting new partnership. Before I pass the call over to Brian to get details on our financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2018, I\u2019d like to provide a recap of the substantial progress we made on our strategic priorities in 2017. Growing our business remains a top priority. And in 2017, we achieved this through organic growth, new deals and the renewal of several key partnerships. We are driving organic growth through digital innovation, data analytics and innovative marketing, promotions and value propositions on several of our cards. We had a very successful year in renewing more than 15 key relationships and winning more than 20 new deals in our three sales platforms. We continue to pursue new opportunities to expand our business, particularly in areas where we see outsized opportunity. PayPal is an example of this, and is especially important as it will expand our presence in the digital payment space. Another example is our efforts to further penetrate the travel and entertainment sector where appropriate and we continue to make progress in 2017 with the launch of the Cathay Pacific program. Extending the utility of our cards is another key focus area, particularly expanding the network in which our cards are accepted, so that our cards can move to the top of cardholders\u2019 wallets. This is especially important in our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms, where we\u2019ve been working to migrate cardholders towards more repeat purchase behavior. To that end, in Payment Solutions, we launched the Synchrony Car Care network, which offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. The utility of this card continues to be enhanced with the addition of new partners, such as Mavis Discount Tire being added to the network. Similarly, we also launched the Synchrony home credit card network accepted by retails at more than 10,000 locations in verticals, such as home furnishing, flooring and electronics. In CareCredit, we recently announced the roll out of our new CareCredit Dual Card. This new card combines the promotional credit capabilities of the standard CareCredit card for purchases within our extensive network with the added convenience of MasterCard acceptance. The upgrade offers cardholders the ability to earn points for all purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted and offers enhanced rewards for health, fitness, grocery and debt-related purchases. We also further expanded the CareCredit network with our acquisition of the Citi Health Card portfolio in early 2017, and have also expanded into several new verticals, such as durable medical equipment, orthopedics and physical therapy. The number of provider locations increased by more than 10,000 in 2017. The progress we\u2019ve made in improving the utility, and therefore, the usage of our card is evidenced by our reuse rate. For Payment Solutions, the reuse rate in the fourth quarter was 29% and for CareCredit it was 54% of total purchase volume. During 2017, we continued our focus in investment on enhancing our leading-edge digital and data analytics capabilities. Early in the year, we acquired GPShopper, an innovative developer of mobile apps that offer a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytics tools and through which we launched our innovative app plug-in, we call SyPi. We now have 10 partners using the app plug-in and to date we\u2019ve seen a significant growth in usage. We are expanding our mobile engagement capabilities, improving the functionality and ease of use for mobile users and our partners. And this capability enhancing acquisition will help us to do that. We have invested in a next-generation data environment, which gives us a more holistic view of the customer and enables us to drive higher engagement and a better customer experience using disparate data sources and machine learning techniques. We now have access to approximately 70% of SKU or category level data on the over 1 billion transactions that go over our network compared to less than half of transactions just three years ago. This is important as we increasingly partner with retailers to leverage this information to grow their program. Additionally, we are using advanced analytic techniques, such as media mix optimization to improve return on marketing investments. Given our significant operational successes and strong growth, we have also had to focus on funding that growth and our deposit base has become an increasingly important part of that equation, especially direct deposit. We have made investments to enhance the online direct deposit experience for consumers, and this has helped drive direct deposit growth of 13% over the past year. Overall, deposits now comprise 73% of our total funding sources. Through all of this expansion and investment, we\u2019ve been able to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver value to our shareholders, not only through growth, but via improved capital payout distribution with both an increase in dividends and a substantial increase in share buybacks and the plan we announced last may. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to outline our financial results for the quarter and our expectations for the upcoming year. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $385 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. But this included the impact related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, driven by the lower corporate tax rates in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December. Excluding this impact, we earned $545 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 7% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 8% over last year. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 3% over last year. The slower growth compared to recent quarters was due to the underwriting refinements we have noted previously and the HHGregg bankruptcy. I will cover the impact of the underwriting refinements we\u2019ve made in more detail later in the presentation. As we move forward and the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate, we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. We had another solid quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 4% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year. RSAs decreased $32 million, or 4%. While we share the strong top line growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was offset by higher incremental provision expense. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.9% for the quarter, down from 4.5% last year. For the year, RSAs were 3.9% versus 4.2% in 2016, reflecting one of the natural offsets in our business model. The provision for loan losses increased 26% over last year, primarily driven by credit normalization. The reserve build in the quarter was $213 million lower than the $275 million range we had expected, driven by moderating credit normalization trends as we enter 2018 and slightly lower receivables growth. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation. Other income was $23 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $12 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense and increased by $36 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $52 million, or 6% versus last year, driven primarily by growth in marketing. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline our back office. Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter compared to 31.6% last year over a 130 basis point improvement. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage. I\u2019ll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 8%, driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.24% compared to last year\u2019s margin of 16.26%. The margin was largely in line with our expectation. The margin benefited from a slightly higher mix receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we\u2019re holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. This was offset by a slight decline in the yield on receivables down 8 basis points from last year, as well as higher funding costs that increased by 18 basis points, driven by higher rates in our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to higher benchmark rates and prefunding related to PayPal. We will cover our expectations for the margin going forward in our 2018 outlook later. Next I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I\u2019ll start with the delinquency trends. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.67% compared to 4.32% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.28% versus 2.03% last year. Moving to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.78% compared to 4.65% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. This resulted in a 5.37% NCO rate for the year near our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.8% and the reserve build from the third quarter was $213 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $275 million range we expected due to moderating impact from credit normalization and somewhat slower receivables growth. As we look forward to 2018, I\u2019d like to describe the impact related to the underwriting refinements on our more recent vintages and our purchase volume growth. First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. As you remember, we started making refinements to our underwriting in the second-half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. Now surprisingly, these underwriting refinements have also resulted in changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, we continue to grow purchase volume at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score greater than 721, which increased 10% over the same quarter last year. While purchase volume for the below 665 FICO range actually declined 13%, reflecting the actions we have been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond. Later, I\u2019ll provide our outlook on credit expectations for next year. In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results will moderate as we move into 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $970 million, up 6% over last year. Expenses continued to be primarily driven by growth and marketing. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter over a 130 basis point improvement over last year, as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, while continuing to fund our strategic investments. For the full-year, the efficiency ratio was 30.3%, down over 80 basis points from the prior year and well below our original outlook back in January of approximately 32%. Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by over $4 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 72% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer-term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. As part of our prefunding plan for the PayPal Credit portfolio, we did issue $1 billion of 10-year fixed rate debt in the fourth quarter, which was very well received by the market. We will continue to execute our prefunding plan as we prepare to onboard the PayPal portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding. So overall, we continue to execute our funding strategy and feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 15.8% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17% on a fully phased-in basis last year around 120 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth. Total liquidity was $21.1 billion, which is equal to 22% of our total assets. This is down from 22.5% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased $430 million of common stock during the fourth quarter. We have a little over $600 million remaining in share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our Board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2018. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Next on Slide 11, I\u2019ll recap our 2017 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables. Our growth of 7% was in line with our outlook range of 7% to 9%. The growth in 2017 continued to be driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth. Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth, as well as win new programs. Moderately tempering some of the growth was the impact from the underwriting refinements we began to implement in the second-half of 2016 and continued in 2017. Net interest margin was 16.35% for the year, which is better than the original range of 15.75% to 16% we provided back in January. Higher receivables yield from higher revolve and benchmark rates, a more optimal asset and funding mix along with some benefit from a lower than expected deposit rate data were the major drivers for the outperformance. RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in substantially lower than our outlook last January. RSAs came in at 3.9% versus the outlook of 4.4% to 4.5%, mainly driven by the sharing of higher provision expense, partly offset by program performance. This demonstrates the countercyclical nature of the RSAs. Our net charge-off rate of 5.37% was largely in line with our revised outlook in the low 5% range. Net charge-offs continued to normalize off the very favorable levels in 2015 and 2016 and we expect this to continue into next year, which I will discuss in our outlook. The efficiency ratio for the year was 30.3%, significantly lower than the outlook of around 32%. We continue to drive strong operating leverage through higher margins, revenue growth and increased productivity, which all led to the outperformance. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.3%, excluding the impact of the Tax Act. The higher margin and operating leverage were offset by higher provision expense. The higher provision expense was partially offset to the RSAs. Moving to our 2018 outlook on Slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2018 assume the Fed continues to tighten this year and the unemployment rate is mainly stable. We are providing a view without the impact of onboarding the PayPal Credit portfolio, as well as an outlook including the portfolio. We expect to close in the third quarter of 2018 and assume a closing date of July 1, 2018 for purposes of the outlook. Our outlook for receivables growth without PayPal is in the 5% to 7% range. The slightly lower growth rate takes into account underwriting refinements and assumes economic trends continue. We expect to grow sales volume at two to three times broader retail sales and for e-commerce to continue with strong growth. We expect the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio to drive the growth rate in the 13% to 15% range in the second-half of 2018. We believe our margin before the PayPal portfolio impact would continue to run in the 16.25% range next year. But prefunding the portfolio will have a dilutive effect on the margin, as the funding is held in short-term liquid assets until the portfolio is onboarded. We believe this may push the margin down closer to 16%, and depending on the timing and magnitude of the prefunding may push the margin into the 15.75% to 16% range for the full-year of 2018. We expect that RSAs as a percent of average receivables will trend back into the 4.2% to 4.4% range for 2018. This is higher than the 3.9% for 2017 and reflects continued strong performance of our programs, somewhat higher loyalty program expenses and moderating reserve build expectations. The expansion of the PayPal program in the second-half of 2018 will not impact the expected range. In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs for 2018 will be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range, driven by continued normalization and slightly lower receivables growth. While the timing of the PayPal portfolio addition given its size will impact the NCO rates in the second-half, we expect to end in a similar range for the full-year. Looking at seasonality and net charge-offs. We typically see the NCO rate trend higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, due to the seasonal decline in receivables. While the increase has been in the 50 to 70 basis point range over the past two years, we are expecting a more modest increase as normalization moderates and closer to what we have seen historically. Regarding loan loss reserves builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth-driven, given our expectation that credit normalization trends will continue to moderate. The addition of the PayPal portfolio will add to the reserve builds in the second-half of this year. We will need to establish a reserve for the portfolio under our reserving methodology and we anticipate a substantial portion of the reserve will be established by year-end 2018. Given the size of the portfolio, this will substantially add to our overall reserve build in the back-half of 2018. This is the main driver of the EPS solution we expect in the second-half of the year after we acquire the portfolio. For the first quarter, we expect the reserve build to be in the $200 million to $225 million range similar to the fourth quarter and down from the prior run rate, driven by moderating credit normalization trends. Moving to the efficiency ratio. For 2018, we expect to continue to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 31% similar to 2017. This would not change with the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, whoever this will be partly offset by continued spend on strategic investments we feel are important to the business. Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward, as we expect the business to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long-term. Finally, we expect to generate a return on assets of around 2.5% in 2018, including the impact of lower corporate taxes and the estimated dilution from the PayPal transaction. Given the lower corporate tax rates passed in the Tax Act, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 25% range going forward. This includes both federal and state taxes. Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2018. We are planning to follow a very similar process as before. We will use the Fed scenarios and assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that will review with our Board and our regulators in April, and hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans on a similar timeline as we did last year. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth and program acquisitions. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll close with a recap of our strategic priorities that we continue to focus on to drive value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders. A top priority is to continue to execute across our three sales platforms : building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and digital and mobile technology. We expect to continue to drive organic growth and we\u2019ll evaluate potential new programs with appropriate risk adjusted returns. We will make investments necessary to expand the utility of our card and work with our partners to deliver innovative ideas and attractive value propositions to drive card usage. We will continue to invest in next-generation data, analytics and technology offerings and leverage SKU in category level data to help drive an even higher level of engagement with our customers. Digital and mobile technologies will also remain a top investment priority as the market moves more to these channels, as well as investing in the talent to help develop and drive these capabilities. Our banking platform remains an important funding source, and as such, we will continue to broaden our products and capabilities. We will also continue to explore new opportunities to leverage our expertise and product offerings in areas where we may not have traditionally had meaningful penetration, such as the travel and entertainment space. It remains paramount that we operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We have proven our ability to do this and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit rating and regulatory targets. Finally, we will continue to leverage our strong capital position. Our capital priorities are first and foremost organic growth and program acquisitions. Second, capital return to dividends and share repurchases. And lastly, M&A that helps us enhance our capabilities to support growth. Synchrony continues to be well-positioned for long-term growth, and we look forward to driving further value for our partners, cardholders and shareholders in 2018. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. Brian, maybe first question on the credit quality and the performance in recent vintages. When I look at the charge-off rates for 2018, those seem to be trending a little bit softer than what you guys had initially talked about in terms of a range. Could you just reconcile that with the fact that you\u2019re seeing the \u2013 the later stage vintages, recent vintages trend better? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Sanjay. So, look, we generally say that credit is trending exactly in line with our expectations. We gave you an outlook of 5.5% to 5.8% for 2018. Based on all of the trends that we\u2019re seeing, the pace of normalization will flow and will moderate as we move through the year very consistent with our prior view. The only small tweak that we made was to factor in slightly lower receivables growth. So just due to some of the underwriting refinements that we made, we took down growth just slightly and that does have an impact on the rate. But when we look at the vintages, as we noted earlier, 2017 vintage performing better than 2016, it\u2019s more in line with 2015. We have seen a change in the mix on sales. We highlighted just in the fourth quarter that sales are down in that below 660 FICO range. But we\u2019re still seeing really good growth in the 720-plus range, sales, they were up 10%. So, again, very much in line with our expectations. The only small tweak was to moderate the growth rate a bit on the core business starting in 2018. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. And then as far as the tax savings are concerned, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. But are you guys expecting to invest any of the tax savings? And do you expect any kind of competitive response, or activity associated with some of the savings from the industry? Margaret Keane : Yes. So, Sanjay, it\u2019s Margaret. How are you? I think, the two areas where we\u2019re looking to make an investment is really on our employees and our communities. In terms of investing in the business, we actually have a lot of growth initiatives already built into our plans for those already accounted for. And I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you would add anything else. Brian Doubles : Yes, I\u2019d say generally, Sanjay, look, we\u2019re very focused on using this benefit in a way that drives real value for our shareholders. I think, that\u2019s our primary objective. We\u2019re able to do some things for employees, a little bit more on charitable contributions. The impact there is pretty modest, it\u2019s included in our outlook. And then, as Margaret said, we\u2019re always looking at where we can make additional investments in the business. But when we look at that, look, we\u2019re fully funding most of the growth initiatives today that meet our return hurdles. So anything additional there from our perspective right now would be pretty marginal. Sanjay Sakhrani : Yes. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. Brian Doubles : Good morning, John. Margaret Keane : Good morning, John. John Hecht : And a high-level first question is, maybe can you give us just any update on incremental trends in the competitive market? And then any updates on any progress for upcoming notable renewals? Margaret Keane : Sure. So, I think that competitive environment has been pretty much the same. We expect 2018 to be the same as 2017. I think, probably for us what we\u2019re very focused on is our renewals. I can\u2019t comment on any particular one. But what I would tell you is that, our teams are well entrenched in our partners and working every single day to work on those renewals and working hard to really focus on what our partners need. So, we feel pretty good about the pipeline. We felt pretty good about the competitive environment, and we\u2019re investing to make sure we\u2019re meeting our partners\u2019 needs, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. John Hecht : Okay, thanks for that. And then, Margaret, do you have any of the digital stats that \u2013 you\u2019ve given these historically the e-commerce composition and the growth in that segment? Margaret Keane : Sure. Sure, so I would say that online sales were up 15% year-over-year and that growth is in line with where the industry is now, which is about 15%. I would say, one of the real positive is, we continue to see some really good sales penetration in our retail card business, which was up 26%, 1.5% over the prior quarter. So we continue to stay very focused on this and driving volume through the mobile and digital channels. John Hecht : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Brian, I was kind of intrigued by the disparity between the growth at the higher-end of the FICO band and the lower-end. Just maybe could you talk a little bit of how long that persists? I mean, is that several quarters, or is it longer than that? And when can that that effect of the lower FICO band kind of \u2013 will that go away? Brian Doubles : Yes, Moshe, look, it\u2019s a good question. I think, we would clearly expect that to moderate as we head into 2018. What you\u2019re seeing really and you saw a little bit of it in the third quarter and the fourth quarter is really the cumulative impact of those underwriting refinements that we made starting in the second-half of 2016. So you\u2019re starting to see that come to the books. So when you look at \u2013 and I should just comment that, we\u2019re still booking plenty of sales between 600 and 660 FICO. That\u2019s still a great segment for us. We\u2019re still booking profitable volume at attractive returns there. It\u2019s just when you compare it to what we were doing a year ago, it\u2019s down. Moshe Orenbuch : Right. Brian Doubles : Slightly. So I would think about it continuing for a couple of more quarters, hard to predict exactly. We\u2019re constantly going in and making these refinements based on where we\u2019re seeing the returns and where we\u2019re seeing the profitability. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Just as a follow-up question. The PayPal\u2019s dilutive to your returns in 2018, could you talk a little bit about what that would mean, as it goes forward past that both from the standpoint of what you might see in terms of its impact on the company\u2019s growth and returns? Brian Doubles : Look, it\u2019s obviously a great growth opportunity for us. We cannot be more excited about the program and the expanded partnership with PayPal. I think, in terms of how to think about it going forward, we\u2019ve been very clear on 2018 what the impact is at PayPal. As you move into 2019, it\u2019s definitely accretive from an EPS standpoint. Longer-term, the return is in line with the overall return of the business. So we really like the program. We really like the returns. It\u2019s got a very resilient earnings profile through multiple scenarios, which is something obviously that we look for when launching a new program or expanding a partnership. So we\u2019re\u2026 Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Brian Doubles : Like I said, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about it. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Brian, we saw the year-over-year change in your delinquency rate slow last November for the first time in 2017, and then held there again in December, we saw this morning. Is it reasonable to expect that that downward trajectory that we\u2019re now seeing is going to continuous we look ahead. And ultimately, does that translate into less reserve building in 2018 versus 2017 and also less reserve building in 2019 versus 2018 x PayPal and assuming that their current environment \u2013 macro that \u2013 environment that we\u2019re in persist? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Bill. Look, great question. I think, as you pointed out, the delinquency trends did begin to moderate this quarter. So, last quarter \u2013 or I guess, third quarter year-over-year, they were up 54 basis points. We saw that come down to 35 basis point increase in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So that was in line with our expectations. It\u2019s obviously driven by some of the tightening that we\u2019ve done. We would expect that trend to continue. That\u2019s part of what you saw in the reserve build coming in better than our expectations here in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve given you a view of what we think reserves look like in the first quarter. Clearly, for the year, we expect the reserve builds to moderate and return to being more growth-driven than they were certainly in 2017. So again, the outlook, very consistent both on credit and reserve builds to where we thought it would be earlier in the year. Bill Carcache : So perhaps just to extend that thought process a little bit, I guess, by definition, moving to a more growth-driven from previously having not only being growth-driven, but also normalization and seasoning-driven, that effectively would mean a lower reserve build in 2018 versus 2017, is that thought process reasonable? Brian Doubles : Yes, that\u2019s reasonable. I mean, if you just go back to 2017, our reserve builds for the first three quarters were in that $300 million to $350 million range per quarter. That\u2019s come down now to the $213 million in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re giving an outlook for the first quarter of $200 million to $225 million, so similar to the fourth quarter. And if you just kind of run that out, again, excluding PayPal, right, the core reserve builds, the expectation would be, they would moderate and be lower in 2018 compared to 2017. Then obviously, the addition of PayPal will significantly add to the reserve builds in the second-half. So the best way to think about PayPal is, we\u2019re bringing on the portfolio most likely in the third quarter and we\u2019re starting with a reserve of zero. So effectively, over, call it, roughly nine months, maybe 12 months, we\u2019re going to build a full reserve under our existing methodology. So think about 14 to 15 months for a loss coverage on that and we\u2019re going to build it over nine to 12 months. So a lot of that is going to come in, in the second-half of the year, and that\u2019s really the driver of the $0.20 of dilution that we indicated back in November on PayPal really driven by that allowance build. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s great. Brian, thank you. If I may quickly on my follow-up on NIM. I wanted to ask, perhaps just if you could clarify the NIM compression. Isn\u2019t that more optical than anything else in the sense that it\u2019s driven by the liquidity build associated with kind of prefunding? And so, there really is no kind of negative or adverse NII impact from the liquidity that you\u2019re bringing? Brian Doubles : That\u2019s a good way to think about it. So, the core net interest margin is very stable around that 16.25% range, very consistent with the 2017 rate. So core NIM is stable. And then as you start to include the impact of prefunding PayPal, that does bring the margin down a bit that funding that we\u2019re going to bring on here in the first-half, we hold out in short-term assets until the portfolio is brought on the book. So you\u2019ve got a combination of some negative carry on that funding. You\u2019ve also got the impact from the larger denominator on the NIM rate. So you\u2019ll probably see the largest impact in the second quarter before you bring the portfolio on. So I would think about NIM adjusted for PayPal closer to 16%, it could dip a little below that depending on the timing and the magnitude of the prefunding. That\u2019s why we gave you a little bit of a conservative range 15.75% to 16%. It was really driven by the timing and the magnitude of that funding is a little bit unknown at this point. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Brian Doubles : But again, I think, importantly, core net interest margin, very stable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Brian, maybe if I can ask about the RSA, so came in at 3.88% well below the original guidance, and now we\u2019re talking about getting back to kind of 4.3% in the middle \u2013 midpoint of the range. I guess, given that, it seems like a lot is also shifting to the loyalty line at this point. Can you just maybe talk about the interplay of the two and how we get back from this 3.88% to something in the 4.2% to 4.4% range? And can you just maybe talk about are the RSAs impacted at all by tax reform, or all the programs based on pre-tax profitability? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Ryan. There\u2019s a lot in there, so bring me back if I miss something. I think, in terms of the RSA, the best way to think about it is to go back to our original outlook for 2017, which was 4.4% to 4.5%, okay, 4.4% to 4.5% for the year. That that\u2019s what I would consider more of a historical norm on the RSAs. Now, as you pointed out, we ended the year at 3.9%, right? And that was due primarily to the retailers sharing in that incremental provision expense that we had, as well as additional loyalty program expense, okay? So those two items more than offset the increase in sharing from higher margins and we also had better operating leverage year-over-year. So, look, I think, that\u2019s obviously a good thing. That highlights one of the natural offsets to credit normalization for our business. So now as you start to think about 2018, we expect the RSAs to be in that 4.2% to 4.4% range. That reflects both the combination of strong program performance. We also expect the reserve build, as I mentioned earlier, to moderate as we move through the year. So just the construct of lower reserve builds, obviously, our partners will benefit from that. That increases the RSA payments and it puts us closer to that historical range. It doesn\u2019t put us all the way back, but we think somewhere in the 4.2% to 4.4% range. Ryan Nash : Got it. Now if I could just ask a follow-up. Just in terms of the credit guidance, the 5.5% to 5.8%, given that, consumers are obviously going to get a benefit from tax reform. Can you talk about is there anything baked into your guidance in terms of improving credit from customers having more money in their pocket? And I guess, just related to that, given the lower core growth that you\u2019re going to be experiencing in the 5% to 7% relative to last year, I think, last quarter you had said something around $170 million or so for reserving for growth. Is that still the right number? Is it lower now, given the fact that growth is a little bit slower? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Ryan. So there\u2019s nothing in the outlook for a better economy or consumers benefiting from personal tax reform. Obviously, lower personal tax rate should provide more discretionary income to the consumer. We would expect to benefit somewhat either through increased sales or on the credit side. But like it\u2019s really too early to speculate on either of those, we haven\u2019t baked anything into the forecast. So I think, look, there\u2019s some reason potentially to be optimistic there. We didn\u2019t include anything. So I think, it\u2019s still a little bit early to tell. And then your other question was on? Ryan Nash : The absolute level of growth reserve build, given slower growth? Brian Doubles : Yes, look, I think that drove a little bit of the build in the fourth quarter being a little bit better than our expectations. Going forward, that\u2019s included in our outlook that reserve build will moderate and come down slightly. But the best way to think about the reserve builds in 2018 compared to 2017 is credit normalization leveling off. We will continue to book reserves for growth. We\u2019re not going to give you a split. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to estimate out beyond really the first quarter. But I think the important thing is that, we\u2019ve included an outlook that as credit normalization is going to level off, you\u2019ll see that in the reserve build. The reserve build will become more growth-driven and that\u2019s all in line with our earlier outlook. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. My question mainly has to do with how conservative you feel this new charge-off guidance is. I mean, you guys I think have been I know that every other guidance item have been overly conservative. But on this one, you\u2019ve had to make \u2013 in charge-offs, you\u2019ve had to make revisions in the past. Just interested to get your perspective on when you set this new guidance for 2018, where you kind of mindful of setting at a level where you\u2019re pretty confident, you\u2019re going to be within that, if not below that range? Brian Doubles : Yes, look, Mark, I \u2013 we tend to give you \u2013 we try to give you our best view of what we think 2018 is going to look like. Some things typically perform a little bit better. Some things come in a little bit worse. And we think, if you go back to 2017, we showed you how we performed against all the key metrics. And you also have natural offsets in the business, I think, you need to take into account. So if you just kind of walk through the 2017 performance, we saw more credit normalization than we thought we would back in January of last year, and the offset to that is lower RSAs and better margins and you get back to a very strong return. And so I think, I \u2013 with the exception of maybe margins, where given the timing of the prefunding that can drive a difference in the rate, I wouldn\u2019t call the guidance conservative. I think, the outlook is our best view. And look, we\u2019re obviously all focused on trying to beat those metrics where we can. Mark DeVries : Okay, fair enough. And then just on the prefunding, is there anything you can do or considering to push that out a bit. So that you\u2019re not carrying too much cash on balance sheet well in advance of getting those receivables? Brian Doubles : Yes, look, I would say, we are acutely aware of how expensive that prefunding is, and we are going to try and manage it as best we can. This is a very large asset that we\u2019re going to bring on here in the third quarter. We\u2019re going to be in regular dialogue with PayPal on timing. And when we expect to close and we\u2019re not going to bring a $1 of funding on that we don\u2019t have to. Mark DeVries : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. There\u2019s an interesting relationship that\u2019s developing between spend growth and loan growth and the gap has widened. Brian, you or Margaret you\u2019ve actually given some very good metrics on the differentiation between the 660 spend above and below. I\u2019m a little bit surprised to see the gap loan growth widen to spend as you have less concentration from the 660 borrowers, line limits for the higher FICO borrowers? Brian Doubles : Yes. So, yes, I mean the best way to think about this is that, when you\u2019re making underwriting refinements and tightening a bit like we have been, you\u2019re going to see that materialize first in your sales, right? So that\u2019s where you\u2019re starting to see that you saw in the third quarter, you see in the fourth quarter. And then the other underlying dynamic credit normalization is, you tend to pick up more revolve on the overall portfolio, right, where back-end 2014, 2015 and 2016, we saw kind of an acceleration in deleveraging that\u2019s come back a bit. And so you see more revolve on the overall portfolio, which is offsetting that decline in purchase volume. Obviously over time, after \u2013 again, the cumulative impacts of some of these \u2013 some of the tightening that we\u2019ve done, you\u2019re going to see that result in somewhat lower receivables growth, which is really what you\u2019re seeing in our outlook in that 5% to 7% range. So at some point that purchase volume will materialize and those two line up more closely. Does that make sense? Rick Shane : Yes, it does. And obviously, the retail partners really value the liquidity that you provide to their costumers. Are you getting any pushback if you tweak the underwriting and make less credit available to those sub-660 borrowers? Margaret Keane : I think, our partners are very cognizant of the fact that they don\u2019t want to put credit in hands of people that can handle it. And we work very closely with them in many cases, almost all cases, their names are on the cards. So we work very closely with them and we are not getting any pushback on credit. They work closely with us and again, we all want to be responsible here, including our partners. Brian Doubles : And again, this is \u2013 these are modest refinements. These aren\u2019t wholesale changes to our underwriting strategy. You\u2019re seeing a bit of the cumulative effect on sales, but we\u2019re not changing the overall risk profile of the portfolio. Rick Shane : Got it. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Just a question on the net charge-off rate with the 5.50% to 5.80% guidance for next year with and without PayPal. I\u2019m just wondering, if there\u2019s a \u2013 without PayPal, are you thinking that it\u2019s more in the lower-end of the range and with it\u2019s towards the higher-end of the range. I\u2019m just wondering, because PayPal\u2019s credit quality, at least, as they\u2019ve been underwriting it, is a bit riskier than what you\u2019ve been underwriting. So I\u2019m kind of struck by the fact that you\u2019ve got the same numbers for both scenarios? Brian Doubles : Yes, Betsy. So, look, I think, PayPal might move us around within the range. We don\u2019t think it changes the range for the full-year. I think, it\u2019s a good question. Just given the PayPal portfolio does run at a higher loss rate than our portfolio in the aggregate. As you start to think about 2019 and beyond, we do expect there would be some upward bias on the rate as we move through 2019 and beyond that. But it\u2019s a little hard to be specific that far out. Betsy Graseck : And do you anticipate running the portfolio from a credit perspective the same way they\u2019ve run it, or do you expect to run that piece of the portfolio in line with how you\u2019ve been running the rest of your book? Brian Doubles : Yes. So, well, first, I would just say, we\u2019re very comfortable with the risk profile of the PayPal portfolio. At this point, we don\u2019t anticipate any significant changes in the way that it\u2019s being underwritten today. We\u2019re obviously going to leverage our underwriting analytics and our process. But we\u2019re also going to utilize PayPal scores and some of their techniques. They\u2019ve got a lot of really great transactional data that we can leverage. So when you combine what they\u2019re doing today with some of our proprietary underwriting techniques and some of our models, I think, we can get even more sophisticated around how we manage the portfolio together. So\u2026 Betsy Graseck : Is that something that\u2019s walled\u2026? Brian Doubles : No, go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Is that walled off to PayPal like can you utilize what you learn from that and with others or that\u2019s walled off to that relationship? Brian Doubles : Yes. No, we \u2013 it\u2019s very customized by program. So we don\u2019t air across programs, it\u2019s very proprietary and customized for the individual programs. So what I would say on PayPal, look, we ultimately control underwriting, but we\u2019re going to leverage the data, the tools, the expertise of both companies to make the best underwriting decisions we can. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Greg Ketron : So we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. Just maybe a quick clarification, the efficiency ratio of 31% that you\u2019ve guided to, that does include any kind of reinvestments from the tax benefit that you\u2019re going to get, is that right? Brian Doubles : That\u2019s correct. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. Was there any kind of a noise from the hurricanes in the quarter? And if there was, can you help quantify that? And just maybe the second part to that would be, any comments on the recovery trends? How those been trending? And how do you think about recovery going forward? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So, on the hurricanes back in October, I think, we disclosed that hurricane impact would put us towards the higher-end of the net charge-off rate. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t highlight really anything other than that. And then on recoveries, nothing really in the quarter, recovery pricing was pretty stable. Ashish Sabadra : Okay. And maybe if I \u2013 on the hurricanes if I can just ask a follow-up like, as you go forward, what are your expectations, because that hurricane effect should really come off. So should we see better like underlying trends continue, but that hurricane negative impact come off? Brian Doubles : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t think about it is being material going forward. Ashish Sabadra : Okay, thanks. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Sure. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on a conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. So we hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I'll begin on slide three. Overall, we started the year on a solid note with net earnings of $640 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Loan receivables grew within our expected range and we generated strong net interest income growth. Purchase volume growth slowed in line with expectations given our underwriting refinements and average active account growth was driven by the attractive value propositions and promotional offers on our cards. The net interest margin and efficiency ratio performed as expected, as did our credit quality metrics. Brian will provide more detail on these ratios shortly. Supporting our funding objective, we continue to generate strong deposit growth, which was up 10% during the quarter. This is an important area for us this year as we continue to implement our prefunding plan in preparation for onboarding the PayPal credit portfolio, which we expect to happen in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding. Our capital position remains strong, and we continue to execute our capital plans paying a $0.15 dividend during the quarter and repurchasing 410 million of common stock. We also added some exciting new deals, renewed key relationships, and further expanded our CareCredit network. In our retail card sales platform, we recently signed a new exclusive partnership with Crate and Barrel. The program is designed to expand customers' financing options and reward customer loyalty. In addition to our private label credit card, we will be launching a Dual Card that can be used anywhere that MasterCard is accepted. We are excited about this new program and the innovative financing and rich rewards cardholders will have access to when we launch later this year. We also added new partnerships with jtv, a leading retailer of jewelry and gemstones in United States; and with Mahindra, where we will provide the company's fast-growing U.S. dealer network with promotional financing options for new and used powersports vehicles and accessories. Both of these programs will be part of our Payment Solutions sales platform. We also renewed several other partnerships, including Nationwide Marketing Group, Briggs & Stratton, and American Signature Furniture. And in CareCredit, we established a new strategic relationship with AVMA, the American Veterinary Medical Association. In addition, we expanded our valuable CareCredit network into the growing day and medical spa market, helping spa providers drive growth by offering an additional payment option for consumers. Through our partnership with American Med Spa Association and Spa Industry Association, providers can now make treatments and services more accessible, while expanding their reach to CareCredit's 11 million cardholders. And CareCredit cardholders will now enjoy expanded utility of their card in this in demand wellness segment. An important objective is to extend the utility of our cards, which will move into the top of cardholders' wallets and migrate cardholders towards more repeat purchase behavior. We have made substantial progress in improving the utility, and therefore, the usage of our cards as evidenced by our reuse rates. For Payment Solutions, the reuse rate in the first quarter was 29% and for CareCredit, it was 53% of total purchase volume. Equally important is ease of use of our cards and ensuring that cardholders have access to their cards, rewards, and account information across whatever channel they choose to utilize. We have made investments to develop tools to ensure our cardholders can easily utilize their cards and access account information, including rewards, across our partners' digital channels. SyPi, a mobile plug-in application, is an example of an investment we made to expand our mobile engagement capabilities and where we are receiving very positive response from our retail partners. SyPi is currently being used in 19 of our retail partners' app, leading to a significant growth in usage by cardholders. We are also employing technologies such as Sydney, our Artificial Intelligent-Enhanced Virtual Assistant, which not only makes obtaining information easier for our cardholders, but also improves back-office efficiency. Our digital sales penetration for our retail card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 28% in the first quarter. Over 40% of applications are happening online, with the mobile channel alone growing 37% over the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we also announced another strategic investment, this time, in Payfone, a leader in identity, authentication for digital channels. The investment is one of several we've recently made in the mobile and authentication space and obviously important area given our business model and the increasing move to digital sales channels. We continue to seek these opportunities, which have proven to be very beneficial strategic decisions in the past with our investments in innovative companies, including Lupe, which evolved into Samsung Pay and GPShopper, a business we have since acquired which has delivered several cutting-edge technologies, including SyPi. Given our interest in these innovative companies and seeing the value they can bring to our business and our partners, we have developed a team solely dedicated to the task of finding these opportunities and they will be continuing to seek innovative, value-added solutions that can augment our core business with the latest technology. These will not be large-scale investments. However, they will be important to the evolution of our business. Another area I will highlight is our innovative approach and flexibility in navigating challenges with certain programs. Recently, the hhgregg bankruptcy provided an opportunity for us to accelerate the launch of another successful network card called Synchrony HOME. This card is accepted by retailers at nearly 18,000 locations in verticals such as home furnishings, flooring, and electronics. Launching the network ensures continued card utility, helping us maintain a revenue stream and manage credit performance. So far, cardholder response has been positive, and we're encouraged by the early results. In that same vein, we have decided to give Toys\"R\"Us cardholders the opportunity to convert their cards to a Synchrony MasterCard. To help make this card attractive, we have added a 2% cashback value proposition on all purchases. These are examples of actions that we can take to preserve card utility and relationships with our existing cardholders, even when presented with challenges or issues with programs. This was obviously a very productive quarter for us and we are pleased to continue to generate growth organically, while also launching new programs, extending the utility of our cards, and making strategic investments to improve the position of our business as we compete in an ever-evolving marketplace. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I will give you a quick view on how each of our sales platforms performed during the quarter, which is on slide five of the presentation. In Retail Card, we grew loan receivables 5% over last year, reflecting broad-based growth across our partner programs. Interest and fees on loans increased 7%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth, both purchase volume and average active accounts grew 2%. As I noted earlier, we had another active quarter in our Retail Card sales platform, with the win of a new partner, Crate and Barrel. We are very excited about this relationship and expanding the programs to offer their customers more financing options. We continue to leverage our strong Retail Card foundation and make investments to both drive organic growth and attract profitable new programs. Payment Solutions delivered a strong first quarter. Broad-based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans also increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 7% and average active accounts increased 5%. We are pleased to have added the two new partners in this platform, jtv and Mahindra, while also renewing several key programs. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter, receivables growth of 8% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans also increased 8%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 8%, and average active accounts increased 7%. And we are excited to be expanding into new verticals, increasing utility of our card and helping business attract clients through expanded payment offerings. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. We are extending and deepening relationships, signing new programs, and providing innovative, value-added solutions for our partners and cardholders. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $640 million, which translates to $0.83 per diluted share. We continue to deliver good growth, with loan receivables up 6% and interest and fees on loans receivables up 8% over last year. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 3% over last year. The slower growth in recent quarters reflects the underwriting refinements we have noted previously and the hhgregg bankruptcy. I will cover the impact of the underwriting refinements we've made in more detail later in the presentation. As we move forward in the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate, we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. Average active account growth was 2% over last year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances, with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year. RSAs increased $36 million or 5%. While we shared the strong topline growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was offset by higher incremental provision expense. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.7% for the quarter, the same level as last year and in line with our expectations. The provision for loan losses increased only 4% over last year, a significantly lower increase than we have been experiencing over the past two years. And the reserve build in the quarter was $164 million, lower than the $200 million to $225 million range we had expected and substantially lower than the $332 million reserve build in the first quarter of last year. Both reflect the moderating trends in credit normalization and slightly lower loan receivables growth as well as the impact from our underwriting refinements. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation. Other income was $18 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $13 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $18 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. As we noted previously, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend around 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $80 million or 9% versus last year, driven primarily by growth, marketing, and technology investments. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline our back office. The efficiency ratio was 30.9% for the quarter compared to 30.3% last year and in line with our expectations. The slight increase was driven by timing of strategic investments as well as upfront build cost related to the onboarding of PayPal. Lastly, we did continue our prefunding in the first quarter ahead of the expected closing of the PayPal credit portfolio in the third quarter this year. The increase in liquidity of 15% over last year as well as the increase in liquidity to assets ratio to over 19% versus 18% last year reflect the growth in prefunding through both deposits and wholesale funding. This impacted metrics in the first quarter such as the net interest margin which I will cover next on slide seven. Net interest income was up 7%, driven by the loan receivables growth and net interest margin was 16.05% compared to last year's margin of 16.18%. The margin was largely in line with our expectations. The margin was impacted by a slightly lower mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, driven primarily by prefunding the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition. An increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost of 26 basis points to 2.1% also impacted the margin. Part of the increase in the rate reflects the prefunding strategy as well as higher benchmark rates. This was largely offset by an increase in the yield on receivables, up 18 basis points from last year, mainly due to the increase in prime rates, partially offset by growth in promotional balances. Regarding our margin outlook for 2018, it is unchanged at 15.75% to 16% including the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition. For next quarter as we continue to build the prefunding ahead of the portfolio acquisition you could see the margin decline into the 15.25% to 15.5% range, virtually all driven by the impact of building liquidity ahead of the transaction. This mainly impacts the denominator, earning assets, without much of an offset on net interest income. We expect the core margin to continue in the 16.25% range. And once the portfolio is onboard, the margin will return to those levels as the liquidity is replaced by the PayPal Credit portfolio. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.52% compared to 4.25% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.28% versus 2.06% last year. The rate of increase in both the 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates slowed for the second quarter in a row, reflecting a more modest impact from normalization and the impact of our underwriting refinements. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 6.14% compared to 5.33% last year and in line with our expectations. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.37% and the reserve build from the fourth quarter was $164 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $200 million to $225 million range we expected due to the moderating impact from credit normalization and somewhat slower receivables growth as well as the impact from our underwriting refinements. We expect the reserve build next quarter to be similar to this quarter in the $175 million range. As we look forward to the remainder of 2018, I'd like to describe the impact related to the underwriting refinements on our more recent vintages and our purchase volume growth. First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. As you remember, we started to make refinements to our underwriting in the second half of 2016, and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. Not surprisingly, these underwriting refinements have also resulted in changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, we continue to grow at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score greater than 721, which increased 8% over the same quarter last year, while purchase volume for the below 660 FICO range actually declined 15%, reflecting the actions we have been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond. In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results to continue to moderate as we move through 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $988 million, up 9% over last year. Expenses continue to be primarily driven by growth, marketing, and technology investments. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio is 30.9% for the quarter versus 30.3% last year and in line with our expectations. The slight increase was driven by timing of strategic investments as well as upfront build costs related to the onboarding of PayPal. Our efficiency ratio outlook for the year remains around 31%. Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital, and liquidity position as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced last May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by nearly $5 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 72% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we're pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. As part of our prefunding plan for the PayPal Credit portfolio, we did issue $500 million of unsecured debt in the first quarter. We will continue to execute our prefunding plan as we prepare to onboard the PayPal portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding. So, overall, we continue to execute our funding strategy and feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, a 90 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $24.6 billion, which equated to 25.7% of our total assets. This is up from 24.4% last year, partly reflecting the prefunding ahead of the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition, which we are holding in liquidity until the portfolio is onboard. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced last May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased 410 million of common stock during the first quarter. We have $210 million remaining in share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30th. I'd also like to provide an update on our 2018 capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to our regulators in early April. This is in line with the timeline in previous years and we hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans later this quarter. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks in addition to supporting our growth and the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio during the third quarter. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view for the year. First, regarding our margin outlook for 2018, it is unchanged at 15.75% to 16%, including the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition. For next quarter, as we continue to build the prefunding ahead of the portfolio acquisition, you could see the margin decline into the 15.25% to 15.5% range, largely driven by the impact of building liquidity ahead of the transaction. This mainly impacts the denominator, earning assets, without much of an offset on net interest income. We expect the core margin to continue in the 16.25% range and once the portfolio is onboard, the margin would return to those levels as the liquidity is replaced with the PayPal Credit portfolio. We continue to expect NCOs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for the full year of 2018, including the impact of PayPal. We expect credit normalization to continue to moderate. It is also important to remember that seasonality results in a higher net charge-off rate in the first half of the year compared to the second half, with the third quarter being the low point in the NCO rate. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds to continue to transition to be more growth-driven as we move through 2018. We believe the reserve build in the second quarter will be similar to this quarter in the $175 million range. The onboarding of the PayPal Credit portfolio will result in much higher reserve builds in the second half of this year after the portfolio is on boarded due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions. We will provide more specifics around this after the portfolio is acquired, which we continue to expect will be in the third quarter. Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and continue to expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic and marketing investments to drive growth as well as the upfront build costs related to the onboarding of PayPal. In summary, the business continues to generate good growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer are consistent going forward, our expectation is that core reserve builds will continue to moderate throughout the year, which combined with continued growth of the business and the impact from continued capital actions will help us generate EPS growth in 2018. And while the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition creates a degree of EPS dilution this year, this will turn EPS accretive in 2019 and help provide a nice tailwind to EPS as we move forward. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap-up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Guided by our strategic priorities, our results this quarter, including the many renewals and program wins, demonstrate our commitment to our partners and cardholders and the value they derive from our products and services. We started the year with solid results, fully in line with our expectations and we'll continue to focus on generating momentum as the year proceeds, working every day to earn the business of our partners and attract new programs. Returning capital to the shareholders remains a key priority and we are pleased to continue to return significant capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. We are also deploying capital through organic growth and program acquisitions. The previously announced acquisition of PayPal's U.S. Consumer Credit Receivables portfolio is an example of this, as are the strategic investments we are making in our business to help it grow. At the end of the day, we remain focused on risk adjusted returns, on making strategic business decisions that help us grow our business and deliver value for our partners, cardholders, and shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up to Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. And really helpful detail in terms of the credit steps that you're taking and its impact on the overall portfolio. When you think about what you've done and this -- your ability to generate kind of 8% growth, perhaps 720, I guess, is the reduction in the sub-660, is that something that's ongoing or are there are steps that you're taking to figure out how the put that back so it's not going to be as big a drag at some point? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure Moshe. So, what I would say is that what we're seeing right now in the purchase volume, both last quarter and this quarter is really the cumulative impact of the changes that we started to make back in the second half of 2016. So, I think you're going to see a continued reduction in purchase volume on accounts below 660 FICO. I think it probably lasts maybe through the balance of this year and then I think as we get into 2019, just given that we will be comping against those periods where we have lower sales in that segment, I think the purchase volume will kind of moderate or impact on the purchase volume will moderate as we get into 2019 and you won't feel as much of an impact on the overall stats. Does that make sense? Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Yes, it does. And just on a related matter, maybe. Given that I think that the level of overall credit in the PayPal portfolio is slightly below yours, how does that inform your thoughts about how you can manage that portfolio from both existing credit and the group standpoint? Brian Doubles : Yes, that's a great question. I mean, first, I'd say that we don't just look at the loss rate when we're evaluating one of our programs. We look at the overall return that we're earning on the program; we look at the resiliency of those earnings in various scenarios, including stress scenarios. And what I can tell you is that we're very comfortable with the risk profile of the PayPal Credit portfolio. I think it's well underwritten. We really like the risk adjusted returns. With that said, while we don't see -- I don't see any significant underwriting changes that we're planning to make at this point. We're obviously going to work with PayPal very closely. I think one of the benefits is they've got a ton of data on their customers. We're going to marry that up with some of our tools and I think jointly, we'll be in a position to make really good underwriting decisions going forward. But I wouldn't expect to see any significant changes. Again, overall, we're very comfortable with the risk profile of that portfolio. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good morning, guys. Brian Doubles : Hey Ryan. Ryan Nash : Brian, in regard to the reserve build whether this quarter or into 2Q, can you maybe separate for us what was driven by growth, given the fact that the portfolio has -- the growth rate has have over the last year or so and versus what's driven by normalization? And I take the point that you're going to be giving us specific guidance related to PayPal after the deal closes, however, can you just provide us with some view of how we should at least think about the build in the back half of the year, how much will come in the back half of the year versus maybe how much will come in 2019? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Ryan. So, if you think about the reserve build of $164 million, obviously, that came in below our expectations, which is good news. It was driven primarily by a combination of moderating impact from credit normalization. Receivables growth drove a small portion of that. It came in slightly below our expectations. But if you remember, we guided to 5% to 7% receivables growth, we came in at 6%. So, I would say on the receivables growth that we're tracking pretty much in line with expectations. So, really, what you're seeing when you think about the reserve build is the impact from the underwriting refinements that we made. So, things are trending in the right direction, very much in line with our expectations. So, as you think about the second quarter just based on the trends that we're seeing we think the reserve build next quarter will come in in a similar range something around $175 million. And again, significantly lower than the trends we were seeing in 2017. So, that gets you through the first half of 2018 and then as you think about PayPal coming on. The thing that you've got to remember with PayPal is it comes on with no reserves. We're obviously going to book our standard 14 to 15 months of forward losses. Those reserves will get built over nine to 12 months and think about a fairly significant portion of that reserve build coming in the second half. So, you'll see more of that reserve build in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter, and then it starts to taper off as you get into the kind of the first half of 2019. Other than that-- Ryan Nash : Got it. Brian Doubles : \u2026we've got to bring the book on. We'll give you a little more color next quarter when we have a really good sense at that point of what the portfolio looks like. Ryan Nash : Got it. I appreciate the color. And then while I know it's still early just given your comments around the recent vintage performance and based on the trends that you've been seeing I guess are you guys still expecting credit in the core portfolio to begin to level off in the second half? And maybe early what do you think this could potentially mean for 2019 charge-offs on the legacy portfolio ex-PayPal? Brian Doubles : Yes. Ryan I think it's a little early to start calling 2019 net charge-offs. What I can tell you is that the first quarter was very much in line with our expectations. We're not changing our view for the full year. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be in that 5.5% to 5.8% range for the full year. Everything is pretty consistent with what we communicated back in January. When we look at the vintages they're performing in line with our expectations. The 2017 vintage looks better than 2016 and more in line with 2015. We're obviously as we talked about earlier remixing the portfolio a little bit, a little bit less than below 660, a little more and above 720. And you're seeing that come through in both the reserve build and delinquencies which have moderated in the past two quarters. And I think those are probably the two best indicators that tell you things are on track. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks Ryan. Operator : And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Brian good morning. Clearly credit seems to be improving on a year-over-year basis, but as you talk to investors, I think one of the big concerns right now is sort of renewals and how to think about and should that sort of cap the multiple and obviously can't comment on that. But can you give us some any sort of commentary around these big renewals that you have in 2019? Do you think you'd be closer to providing some kind of color as we go through 2018? Or will this just sort of hit us one day, and we'll get a press release? Margaret Keane : So -- hi it's Margaret, how are you? Don Fandetti : Hey Margaret. Margaret Keane : So, what I would say is we're well-entrenched with in partners and working every day to do these renewals. Obviously, we know what's important to communicate as soon as we can. What I can tell you is we can't really tell you sooner than when we know. But what I can tell you is the entire organization is focused on renewals. We work with our partners every single day to make sure we're meeting their needs and having the right conversations at the right levels to ensure we're working hard to get those renewals under our belt. Don Fandetti : Okay. And Brian, a clarification on the delinquency. From a year-over-year basis, it improved in Q1. Do you see that -- do you see further improvement there? Or do we sort of have what we are going to see on a year-over-year delinquency change? Brian Doubles : No, I think you're seeing a trend in line with our expectations. If you go back to the third quarter last year, the year-over-year increase was 54 basis points, it came down to 35 last quarter, it came down to 27 this quarter. So, that's trending in the right direction. Look, I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter, but we would expect the delinquency trends to continue to moderate in advance of net charge-offs moderating. So, I think we're certainly trending in that direction. Don Fandetti : Fair. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on capital, in particular, as it relates to regulatory reform. I know that there's a lot unknown still, but just broadly speaking some non-GSIBs have indicated that the potential to return capital more freely without having to go through the annual process is really the biggest benefit that they see potentially driving, more so than any potential expense savings. You guys are now at 16.8% for CET1. Can you help us frame the potential that you guys could do -- would be willing and/or able to do kind of a stepped-up increase in your buyback to get that 16.8% down closer to peer levels versus the more gradual path that you guys have talked about historically, of course, all subject to regulatory reform? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. It's a great question. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces in all the proposals that are out there, even the more recent ones. I would say based on what we're seeing right now, I think the positives probably outweigh the negatives for us, particularly if they soften some of the requirements for banks below $250 billion in assets. So, I do think that should benefit us. So, there's definitely some reason, we think, to be optimistic, but we've really got to wait and see what gets past. As you've highlighted, we are sitting on a significant amount of excess capital today. We have indicated that our goal is to bring our ratios more in line with the peer set. When we look at our business, the returns, the resiliency of the earnings profile and distressed environment, we compare very well to our peers, so we do feel like that as an achievable target over time. However, it's a little immature for us to really speculate on the pace or the magnitude of any future payouts. The good news is that with the combination of good organic growth, PayPal is a great use of capital -- deploying capital at attractive returns, strong dividend, buyback. We've got a lot of options available to us to bring the capital ratio is more in line. But any more specific commentary is a little premature. Bill Carcache : That's helpful. Thanks Brian. If I may on the same topic and follow-up with a question around liquidity. And perhaps could you talk a little bit about the amount of liquidity that you guys now hold, perhaps how that could change if you were able to run with the amount that you need, rather than the amount that, I guess, you're currently required to run out for regulatory purposes. And if regulatory reform were to allow you to maintain less liquidity, maybe just frame for us what that could mean for your NIM? Brian Doubles : Yes, I would think about any impact there, Bill, being pretty modest. If you look at how we operated last year and take liquid assets as a percent of the total, that's probably the range to expect going forward. Now, you're going to see that percentage tick up. You saw it in the first quarter. You're going to see an even greater increase in the second quarter for the prefunding for PayPal. But once that normalizes out and we bring that portfolio on, I would think about liquid assets as a percent of total being pretty much in line with how we ran in 2017. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Two more PayPal questions. One just to make sure I understood. I heard you say that look post-PayPal; you wouldn't expect to run these differently on a credit perspective. So, I just want to make sure I understand, does that mean that you're taking in PayPal a little bit lower risk that stays that way? Your portfolio stays your way and the blended average is a little bit lower than where it is today? Or do you expect interested over time, you would be moving the PayPal portfolio towards your current risk characteristics? Brian Doubles : Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. We're very comfortable with the loss rate and the overall return profile is very attractive on PayPal. And if you remember, we don't underwrite all of our programs the same way. We have a very customized approach. So, we operate the programs today with different loss rates and that depends on a lot of factors. It depends on the margin on those programs, the overall return profile, the resiliency of those earnings. And when we look at PayPal, we're very comfortable with the overall profile. So, the way I would think about that in terms of the total company is we've indicated we don't expect it to have an impact on the net charge-off rate this year. I do think it'll provide a little upward bias in loss rate as we move into 2019, but it should be pretty modest. And overall when we look at the entire company inclusive of PayPal, we're very comfortable with the risk profile. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then on RSAs, how does the PayPal portfolio impact the RSAs, either in percentage terms or seasonalities, is there any change to that we should be anticipating? Brian Doubles : Yes. So, if you go back to our outlook, we provided a ratio for RSAs at 4.2% to 4.4%, excluding PayPal and unchanged including PayPal that 4.2%, 4.4%. So, it's not significant enough to move that ratio at all for us for the total company. Betsy Graseck : Right. And even when you flip into a full year impact, like 1Q, 2Q, there's no\u2026 Brian Doubles : Yes, I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful change to the RSA rate for the total company. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And no impact on the seasonality? Brian Doubles : No, it shouldn't have much of an impact on seasonality. In terms of seasonality, you do have to factor in the third quarter, we hit a high point in the RSA, but we don't see anything with PayPal that would necessarily change that dynamic. That's really more of a seasonality-driven event, where you've got higher margins, lower charge-offs in the third quarter, that drives increase sharing with the partners. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research. Chris Brendler : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Could you discuss potentially the investments you're making in marketing and whether or not we'll see some of the drag from underwriting start to turn as you head towards the latter part of the year? And particularly, looking at the growth rates in CareCredit where I think you face in pretty competitive set, it feels like the slowdown there may just be underwriting related, but any color on that growth outlook will be very helpful? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Let me -- I'll start on the marketing expenses. I think the increase just in the quarter was largely driven by an increase in marketing on our deposits related to the prefunding for PayPal. We also had some timing in our strategic investments as well as we made some specific growth investments related to some of our Retail Card programs. Obviously, some of those are here with the partners, which is why you saw the RSA come down slightly year-over-year. What was your second question? Margaret Keane : CareCredit. I think on CareCredit, I think we've mentioned this in the past; it's really a great business. And we've really focused our resources on the sell side to increase utility, the card which we're definitely seeing in the core business and then actually, we've expanded verticals that we're going after. So, we're taking the model we built and dentist and vet and taking it to other verticals, which is working out to be a very positive thing as well as the fact that we expanded utility of the card in places like Rite-Aid. So, all of that has come together to allow us to continue to really grow in that particular platform. Chris Brendler : And then just take the slight yield degradation in that CareCredit business to be sort of an indicator of a mix shift of market or is there are other factors going on? Brian Doubles : It's really driven by some merchant or provider mix where we earn a slightly lower merchant discounts from larger providers and so there's a little bit of mix impact year-over-year. But generally, I'd say that core -- the core yield, the core margins are very stable in CareCredit. Chris Brendler : Excellent. Thanks so much. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Just one clarification on the credit stats. I was wondering if you're seeing any behavior among your delinquent borrowers as it relates to tax reform. As these consumers have gotten more discretionary income, have you seen some increase in like payments of delinquent loans? Brian Doubles : Yes. We really haven't seen anything yet, Sanjay. Obviously, we remain optimistic that we may see something this year. As you know, we didn't build anything into our forecast for that. But if we do expect it customers have additional discretionary dollars that they're either going to spend those dollars or maybe delever a bit as we saw with lower gas prices, but it's still very early. So, we just haven't seen anything that we would directly attribute to the tax savings. I think when we look at the trends, when we look at our delinquencies, we would tie it more to the underwriting changes that we made than we would to anything specific on consumer or tax saving. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the RSAs, I was hoping, Brian, maybe you could help me with this, because when you look at RSAs to receivables, that was lower than our expectations. And when you look at that metric year-over-year, the ROA went higher, but the RSA as a percent of receivables didn't. So, how should we think about the RSA levels as it relates to profitability? Or how should we think about modeling it? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Sanjay. We know that this is one of the more challenging aspects of our business for you all to model, which is why we gave you a pretty clear guidance on what to expect. What I can tell you is the first quarter; it came in line with our expectations. I think it's probably helpful if you go back to 2017 where we ended the year at 3.9% of average receivables. If you remember, that was well below our original view of 4.4% to 4.5% for the year and that reduction was driven primarily by the partner sharing in the higher reserve build. So, just with that as a backdrop, as you think about 2018, we think we moved back into that 4.2% to 4.4% range, largely driven by our expectations that the reserve builds are going to continue to moderate as we move throughout the year and you've seen some of that happen in the first quarter. So, as those reserve builds start to moderate, the RSAs move back closer to that historical range that you would have seen in 2015 and 2016. So, I think that's the best way to think about it. If I had to highlight one other thing, I would highlight seasonality. Just to reiterate, the RSAs always had a high point in the third quarter when we see higher margins or net charge-offs, so you need to take that into account. But so far, we're tracking very much in line with our expectations and we think we end up somewhere in that 4.2% to 4.4% range for the year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Just one clarification, usually from first quarter to second quarter, it's reasonably the same, maybe slightly higher. I mean should we assume that's the case versus the second quarter then? Brian Doubles : Look, I think the history is not a perfect predictor here. I think first quarter, we ended on the RSAs where we did to some degree, because net charge-offs were higher. So, it's going to depend and you should see that moderate a bit in terms of the net charge-off rate getting into the second quarter and hit a low point in the third. So, it might tick-up a bit in the second. It'll absolutely be elevated in the third quarter. I think that's the one thing that you can trust and then come back down in the fourth. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. Brian Doubles : Sure. Rick Shane : Margaret, you outlined some strategies in terms of loss mitigation around retailers going through bankruptcy. I'd love to hear your sort of comparison of what you would expect to related to a retailer going through liquidation in terms of charge-off profile versus what you are able to achieve through the mitigation strategy, sort of a champion/challenger analysis. Margaret Keane : Yes. So, first, what I would say is that most of our experience through liquidation is we usually liquidate these books profitably. I think we had an opportunity as we continue to expand our capabilities to think a little differently with the hhgregg portfolio by creating this home vertical, which has been really a real win for us in terms of those cards getting utilized as well as what we're doing on Toys\"R\"Us. Obviously, one of the things we do when a company is going through liquidation is we immediately send our communications to the consumer set. That there debt is still due to us and for the most part, we see customers pay their debt off. Obviously, you might see a little uptick, but it quickly comes down as we start communicating with those customers. I think in this case, the fact that we're providing utility both in the hhgregg case and the Toys\"R\"Us case with a fairly good value proposition, we're expecting a really good performance. I don't know Brian if you had anything. Brian Doubles : Yes. I think one other thing Rick is really important here is maintaining some utility on the card, whether it's through a new program like we do at hhgregg or moving a portion of those customers to I think any brand of MasterCard as we intend to do with the Toys\"R\"Us portfolio. I think if you can offer them a good product with an attractive credit line value prop, then they'll continue to use the card. And your prospects of minimizing the increasing net charge-offs are significantly greater. So, we feel pretty good about our strategies in both cases. Rick Shane : Got it. And look I understand the utility case. If we were to index the expected charge-offs on a pool of loans to 100 and you were to go through -- you were to look at a retail that was going through bankruptcy or through liquidation where do you think that index would go versus expectations? Would it go to 150? And what do you think the mitigation strategy can dampen that too? Is obviously not going to be the baseline does it put you in the middle? How should we think about this? Brian Doubles : Yes. I mean it wouldn't go to 150, Rick. Typically what you see is when there's an announcement on the retailer, you see a tick-up in delinquencies and net charge-offs very manageable. We look for a little bit of reserves for that and then it evens out over time. I mean the thing that is important to remember here is that consumers particularly today are very aware of their credit score. Having come to the financial crisis, I would say consumers are more acutely aware of their credit score and the implications of doing on their credit scores than they've ever been. And I think consumers know their obligated on the debt. We are very proactive in terms of our communication with customers to make sure they know that they're still obligated where to make a payment, how things work. And we generally see, like I said, a modest tick-up initially out of the gate and then that levels off and as Margaret said, we liquidate very profitably in all cases. Rick Shane : Got it. Thank you guys for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : A question around kind of the underlying loan growth trends. Are you still at this point making underwriting tweaks that's contributing to the moderating growth? And should we expect once that's done and you've kind of anniversaried the end of that seeing maybe loan growth reaccelerate? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure Mark. So, look I would say receivables growth at 6% was right in line with our expectations and very much in line with what we communicated back in January. And when you look at the full year and you think about our growth, it's always been a combination of organic growth as well as portfolio acquisitions. And so it'll be 13% to 15% receivables growth this year which is very strong. The question you raised is a good one. We are -- from our perspective, the underwriting refinements the impact to those will moderate as we move into 2019. That's our expectation. With that said you're never really done. We're always taking on new information. We're looking at payment behavior trends. And so we're constantly making modest refinements. What you're seeing in the results this quarter and you saw last quarter is really the cumulative effect of the changes that we started to make back in the second half of 2016. To your point, as you start to lap some of those quarters, the comps will get a little bit easier. We'll probably move maybe closer to the historical growth rate for the business. But overall, we feel very good when we look at the underlying growth. We look at the changes that we made that are clearly having the desired impact, still seeing really good growth in that 720-plus FICO segment. And so this is intentional. It was deliberate and is having the desired results. And I think it starts to even out or should even out as we get into 2019. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. And then are there any receivables coming over with Crate and Barrel? So, can you give us a sense of when and how meaningful that might be? Brian Doubles : Yes. We will acquire a small portfolio, but it won't have a material impact on our results. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Greg Ketron : Hey, Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : And thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning guys. Thanks much for fitting in here. Brian Doubles : Hey John. John Hecht : I guess you addressed the renewals earlier, but I'm wondering whether it's Crate and Barrel or -- which is your recent victory or any other renewals, is there anything you could tell us about changes with respect to partnered prioritizations or the overall economics of the recent renewals and new partnerships that suggest there has been any change in how the overall structures work or is it been pretty consistent with where we were a couple of years ago? Margaret Keane : It's pretty consistent. I think what we always do -- as Brian even mentioned earlier, is we always look at the returns and the sense of the overall portfolio. So, -- and we look at the risk/reward in each of those relationships, how much risk are we taking versus the retailers are taking on. So, we look at the blended returns to make sure that we're making that good risk/reward trade-off as we bring whether renewals back on or new deals. So, I'd say the environment, while continues to be competitive, I think is pretty rational. So, we're feeling good about what we're winning and the portfolios that we're bringing on and the renewals that we're doing. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks. And second question is just wondering whether it's commentary on Amazon or just the overall online, e-commerce trends. Is there anything update you can give us there with respect to penetration rates and so forth? Margaret Keane : Yes. So, -- on Retail Card, our overall penetration rate was 28% for this quarter, which was up about 1.6% from first quarter 2017. Now, the national average is about 15%, so we feel like the continued investments that we're making in our digital capabilities are really ensuring that we're staying ahead of the competitive framework. I think online and kind of that whole frictionless payment experience is something that we're extraordinarily focused on, the investments we made in Payfone which is going to help us more quickly authenticate customers as they apply for credit through their mobile application, I think, is going to be and in the real positive for us. So, we continue to see mobile and online as a critical element of what we're trying to build out and ensure we're best-in-class for our partners. Our partnership with Amazon is a great partnership and one that continues to grow, so we feel really good about where we're positioned there as well. So, overall, we're feeling good where we are on the online space and mobile space and our capabilities that we're building out. John Hecht : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Greg Ketron : Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest for Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : And thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Margaret Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Doubles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide three. Overall, we had a good quarter with earnings of $696 million or $0.92 per share. Loan receivables grew 5% within our expected range and we generated solid net interest income growth of 3%. Brian will provide full details on our quarterly results later in the call. Today I'd like to spend my time addressing the topics that are obviously of greatest interest this morning; the closing of the PayPal transaction and that we will not be renewing the Walmart program agreement. First, I'll start with PayPal. We are very excited about expanding the PayPal partnership which occurred July 02. PayPal's two U.S. credit offerings are now consolidated into one relationship providing significant opportunity for us, PayPal, and PayPal customers. In addition to recently extending our cobranded consumer card program with PayPal for 10 years we are now the exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. As part of the transaction we have acquired PayPal's U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio as well as interest held by other investors totaling $7.6 billion. Moving forward with PayPal to become the exclusive issuer PayPal credit in the U.S. is a natural extension of our successful 14-year relationship. This collaboration built on a key relationship in the rapidly growing digital payment space expands our capabilities within the merchant environment and leverages both companies' strengths in providing seamless digital payments and innovations for merchants and consumers. Together we can provide an enhanced customer experience for thousands of merchants and consumers combining our program management, credit capabilities and balance sheet with PayPal's platform and trusted brand as a leader in digital and mobile payments should help create superior products and offerings for consumers and merchants. The two programs require a unique organizational focus given that they address different customer needs; rewards for co-brand and financing for PayPal credit, two areas in which we have expertise, also having one partner to holistically manage both programs for PayPal allows for synergies and could provide opportunities for migrating customers between products as their needs change. This expanded relationship supports our continued reach in the rapidly growing digital payments channel. We have built a strong reputation in this space and this program will allow us to meet evolving consumer needs. We primarily compete on our capabilities including our significant experience, scale, dedicated teams, data analytics, loyalty programs, digital capabilities and proven record of providing value-added services to our partners. These capabilities all played an important role in expanding our relationship with PayPal. We are obviously extremely happy to have expanded the significant relationship as we leverage the new opportunities to meaningfully expand the program. Brian will detail the financial impact this transaction will have on our outlook for the year later in the call. We also announced that we will not be renewing our program agreement with Walmart which is set to end in the third quarter of 2019. It is important to note at the outset that one of the two potential scenarios will likely play out as a result of not renewing the program; either we sell the existing portfolio to a new issuer or the portfolio will stay with us and we convert the qualifying portion of the portfolio to a general-purpose card. In either scenario we believe we can replace the EPS impact resulting from the nonrenewal and we expect both options will be accretive to EPS relative to renewing the program. Brian will cover the financial implications of not renewing the program later. With regard to not renewing the program, let me begin by saying that we are proud of the value we created for Walmart and our cardholders over the 18 years we managed the credit program for Walmart which began as a startup program. The product development, marketing, and servicing skills, value propositions, and technology, and digital expertise that we brought to the program all played a critical role in the growth and success of the program. Last year we began discussions with Walmart about renewing our relationship. Although we competed aggressively to renew the program, we were unable to reach terms that would have made economic sense for our company and our shareholders. Instead we will focus on opportunities in other areas of our business where we see significant potential for growth at more attractive risk adjusted returns over time. This is consistent with our disciplined approach to managing our business for the long-term. Our capabilities are best in class and we believe that our continued investments in digital and data analytics coupled with our long-standing expertise in managing these programs and scale makes us one of the best credit program providers in the U.S. In this case other elements were in play that would have resulted in an economic profile that was sub optimal for the capital supporting the program. Our strategy across all platforms is based on building long-term relationships with our partners and cardholders by offering superior capabilities, service, and value propositions while generating attractive risk adjusted returns. As I have noted many times, we think about our growth opportunities against the broader backdrop of a payment industry that has been going through a period of significant change. New technologies are driving the consumer behavior and the convergence of in-store and digital commerce is opening up new opportunities that play to the strength of our business. These trends present us with a number of growth opportunities with the expansion of the PayPal strategic credit relationship being a great example of these opportunities. We continue to feel good about the capabilities, products, marketing, servicing, and digital expertise and value propositions we bring to our partners, their programs and cardholders and the economics of these relationships and the ability to grow these programs. We attempted to reach a similar outcome with Walmart, but unfortunately we were not able to agree on terms that made economic sense for us and our shareholders. Instead we will invest in opportunities that we think can generate greater returns over time and help us drive innovation in this space. Walmart has clearly been a sizable relationship for us. Not renewing our agreement at the terms required is the right long term outcome and it does present some options as we move forward. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, who will walk you through the highlights on the quarter, provide details on the PayPal transaction impact to our outlook and discuss our options related to the Walmart portfolio, and the potential financial impacts. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. I'm going to briefly touch on the highlights of the quarter so that I can spend more time on the PayPal and Walmart nonrenewal impacts. This morning we reported second quarter earnings of $696 million which translates to $0.92 per diluted share. We continue to deliver good growth with loan receivables up 5% in interest and fees on loan receivables up 4% over last year. The slower growth in recent quarters reflects the underwriting refinements we have noted previously. As we move forward and the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. RSAs decreased 16 million or 2% from last year primarily due to the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.4% for the quarter compared to 3.6% last year. The provision for loan losses decreased $46 million or 3% from last year driven by the lower reserve build. The reserve build in the quarter was $121 million lower than the $175 million range we had expected and substantially lower than the $325 million reserve build in the second quarter of last year. Both reflect the moderating trends in credit normalizations and slightly lower loan receivables growth due to the impact from our underwriting refinements. Other expenses increased $64 million or 7% versus last year driven primarily by growth in strategic investments as well as expenses related to on-boarding the PayPal credit program. The efficiency ratio was 31% for the quarter compared to 30.1% last year and in line with our expectations. The slight increase was driven by growth, the timing of strategic investments, as well as the upfront build costs related to on-boarding PayPal credit. Lastly we did continue our pre-funding in the second quarter ahead of the closing of the PayPal credit portfolio on July 02. As expected this impacted metrics in the second quarter such as the net interest margin which I will cover next on slide seven. Net interest income was up 3% driven primarily by loan receivables growth and net interest margin was 15.33% compared to last year's margin of 16.2%. The margin was largely in line with our expectations. As expected the largest impact on margin performance was the impact of pre-funding the PayPal portfolio acquisition. Next I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, the key highlights are the improving trends and delinquencies and the lower-than-expected reserve build of $121 million. 30+ delinquencies were 4.17% compared to 4.25% last year. The year-over-year trends in the 30+ delinquency rates continue to improve for the third quarter in a row with the 30+ delinquency rate now slightly below the prior year, reflecting a more modest impact from normalization and the impact of our underwriting refinements. The net charge-off rate was 5.97% compared to 5.42% last year and in line with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.43% and the reserve build from the first quarter was $121 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $175 million range we expected due to the improving credit trends and somewhat slower receivables growth as well as the impact from our underwriting refinements. The most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. We started to make refinements to our underwriting in the second half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. The vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. Not surprisingly these underwriting refinements continued to impact our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO's stratification we continue to grow at a fairly strong pace and accounts with a FICO score greater than 721 which increased 8% over the same quarter last year. Our purchase volume for the below 660 FICO score range actually declined 13% reflecting the actions we've been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond. Moving to slide nine, I'll briefly cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $975 million up 7% over last year. Expenses continue to be primarily driven by growth and strategic investments as well as preparing for the expansion of the PayPal credit program. Moving to slide 10 we ended the quarter at 16.6% CET 1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.2% on a fully phased in basis last year a 60 basis point reduction reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth. During the quarter we completed the capital plan we announced in May of last year. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased 210 million of common stock fulfilling the 1.64 billion and share repurchase our board authorized through June 30. On May 17, we were pleased to announce our new capital plans through June 30, 2019. Our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.21 per share commencing in the third quarter and a share repurchase program of up to 2.2 billion. We began to execute our new plan in May repurchasing 281 million during the quarter in addition to the 210 to complete the prior program for a total of 491 million of repurchases in the second quarter. Now that we have on-boarded the PayPal credit portfolio, I wanted to recap our current view for the year which is on slide 11. As you will know, our current view for 2018 including the PayPal portfolio is fairly consistent with the outlook we provided back in January. Starting with receivables growth taking into account the addition of the nearly $8 billion PayPal portfolio, we still expect our year-over-year growth rate to be in the 13% to 15% range. Regarding our margin outlook for the full year 2018 it is unchanged at 15.75% to 16% including the impact of the PayPal portfolio acquisition. For the next two quarters we expect the margin to be in the 16% range as the liquidity from the pre-funding is deployed to fund the portfolio restoring the margin back to around 16% for the remainder of the year. We expect RSAs to run closer to 4% of average receivables for the year, down from the 4.2% to 4.4% range in the previous outlook. RSAs have been trending lower reflecting the slower growth in recent quarters a modest reduction in yield given improving delinquency trends and the impact of the Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy. We continue to expect NCOs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for the full year of 2018 including the impact of the PayPal portfolio. We expect credit normalization to continue to moderate. It is also important to remember that seasonality typically results in a lower net charge-off rate in the third quarter. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward we thought it would be helpful to break out core reserve build and PayPal reserve build dynamics we expect next quarter. Regarding the reserve build on our existing or core portfolio, we expect the builds to continue to transition to be more growth driven as we move through the rest of 2018 and will be similar to this quarter in the $125 million to $150 million range in the third quarter. The on-boarding of the PayPal credit portfolio will result in much higher reserve build in the second half of this year due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions. We expect the reserve build related to the PayPal portfolio to be in the $300 to $325 million range in the third quarter for a total reserve build of $425 million to $475 million next quarter. Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and continue to expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. We also continue to expect our return on assets will be around 2.5% for 2018. In summary, the business continues to generate good growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer are consistent going forward, our expectation is that core reserve builds will continue to moderate through this year which combined with continued growth of the business and the impact from the continuing capital actions will help us continue to generate EPS growth in 2018. Moving to slide 12, I will walk you through the strategic options for the Walmart portfolio and the potential impacts. Not renewing the program will result in two options regarding the future of the portfolio which we have portrayed on slide 12. In both cases we believe that we can replace the EPS impact of not renewing the program and we expect that both options will be accretive to EPS relative to renewing the program. The two options are we sell the portfolio to the new issuer or we retain the portfolio and convert it to a Synchrony branded MasterCard beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The direction and timing will likely unfold over the next several months. This is a process that is contractually defined and we expect to have clarity on the direction we'll be headed with the portfolio by the end of the first quarter next year. I will start with the scenario were the portfolio was sold to the new issuer. There is a valuation process that will take place and once evaluation process is complete Walmart or the new issuer will have the option to purchase the portfolio at the price determined by the valuation process. If the portfolio was purchased it would transfer to the new issuer in the third quarter of 2019. For us this will free up capital. The way to think about that is using a CET 1 level near 15% as a proxy post the addition of the PayPal portfolio. Given the size of the Walmart portfolio of approximately $10 billion this would be around $1.5 billion of capital freed up. There is also the potential gain on the portfolio as well as releasing the reserve held against the portfolio. While we don't know the specifics at this point, we estimate approximately $2.5 billion could potentially be available to buy back shares or utilize on higher returning alternatives. We would expect to deploy this capital quickly starting as soon as the determination is made whether the portfolio is being sold or retained. We have also identified $300 million to $350 million of expected ongoing expense savings after the portfolio was sold. We believe there would be enough capital available to be deployed to our share buybacks and other alternatives and that combined with expense savings will be enough to offset the EPS impact of not renewing the program and be accretive to EPS had we renewed the program. The sale of the portfolio will not impact the return profile of the company and would also improve certain operating metrics such as credit quality. As an example, the net charge-off ratio alone would improve by approximately 60 to 70 basis points. Moving to the second scenario, once we have clarity on whether we retain the portfolio, we would begin converting the qualifying portion of the portfolio to a general-purpose card. This builds on the successful strategy we used for the formal Toys \"R\" Us portfolio after they filed bankruptcy. There are several benefits in doing this. First, we retain all the economics generated from the program as we no longer share the portfolio returned to an RSA. Second we gain a significant level of diversification in our overall portfolio as we will have a higher mix of general-purpose cards without a contractually defined term tied to a program renewal and we gain flexibility through the potential of increasing our offerings to existing and prospective cardholders in conjunction with strategies such as building out a full-scale deposit platform. And we also have the potential to significantly improve the credit quality of the portfolio at acceptable risk-adjusted returns over time that would enhance the overall return profile of the portfolio. Under this scenario we would begin the conversion of qualifying accounts as early as the first quarter of 2019. For accounts that are not initially converted to a general-purpose card, those cardholders can continue to use their cards at Walmart over the next three years and we will receive royalties from Walmart for card usage over this period. Regarding the brand marketing of the general-purpose card as well as loyalty costs associated with our offering a very attractive value prop on the card, these costs will be more than funded by the economics we now retain that previously were being shared with Walmart as well as the interchange fees we earn on card usage. We will also have an opportunity to optimize the cost structure supporting the portfolio. Overall we believe either scenario, whether we sell the portfolio or retain it will replace the earnings per share being generated by the program and will be accretive relative to what we could have earned from the program if we had renewed it. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. We continue to generate solid results as well as driving growth organically, expanding important programs such as PayPal by launching and renewing key programs and making strategic investments to improve our position in this ever evolving marketplace. We are also seeing other important elements of our business, such as credit quality continue to perform as we had expected. All of this contributes to our ability to return capital to shareholders and we were pleased to announce the significant increases in our dividend and share repurchase program in May. We also focused on deploying capital through organic growth and program acquisitions such as the PayPal program as well as the capability enhancing investments such as e-commerce. And while we are disappointed that we are not renewing our program with Walmart, we are focused on either optimizing the capital freed up if the portfolio was sold or leveraging the benefits from retaining the portfolio. Both provide us the ability to replace and potentially improve EPS and other operating metrics that would have otherwise resulted from renewing the program. We remain focused on risk adjusted returns pursuing strategies that help us to profitably grow the business and deliver value for our partners, cardholders, and shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question. If you have additional questions the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning guys and thanks very much for all the details around Walmart and PayPal and thanks for taking my questions. The first on Walmart, you guys specifically carved out the change in the loss patterns and expense savings, just wondering is there any - would there be any change to the RSA metric in the absence of Walmart? Brian Doubles : So, why don't I walk you through just a little more detail in terms of what to expect on the key metrics, so obviously in terms of the profitability of the business it doesn't really change the return profile of the company as we noted. The biggest impact you see if the portfolio is sold is that improvement in net charge-offs, so you'd see that 60 to 70 basis point improvement there. And then you'd see partial offsets on yield. It would come down just slightly. And then RSAs would move a little higher excluding the Walmart portfolio. And then all in you get back to a similar return for the overall business. So again, I think the biggest change you are going to see is the improvement in the credit metrics and it will be neutral to the return. John Hecht : Okay, thanks Brian. And then I know you guys haven't given any guidance pertaining to 2019, but you will be I think lapping a lot of the tightening next year, but we're also going to have the PayPal portfolio in there. Brian, what's your perception of kind of normalized growth in the portfolio once tightening has been fully imbedded in the system? And then have you guys - can you guys give an update on the way you see the PayPal portfolio growth rate separately? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure John. Obviously we don't give 2019 growth guidance but in terms of the impact the credit actions are taking we've been pretty clear that we'll start to lap those starting probably first or second quarter of 2019 and we would expect to move back more historical norm in terms of the core growth rate for the business, so no change to that view. PayPal is obviously growing at a much faster rate. We see a lot of incremental growth opportunity of PayPal even above and beyond, what we've been - what the program has been growing historically, so ton of opportunity there. So we feel pretty good. As you think about a combination of a strong core growth rate once we start to lap these credit actions combined with bringing on a really high growth program like PayPal, we feel pretty good about 2019, but other than that we're not going to be real specific at this point. We'll give you some more color in January when we do our outlook. John Hecht : Great, thanks very much for the color. Brian Doubles : Sure Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, I was sort of hoping you could expand a little bit on the comment that you made about the kind of results had you retained the program being kind of forgetting the exact words that you used, but maybe just expand on what that would have meant in terms of the ability to earn to generate the returns on your capital and maybe relate that to the discussions that have been out there about some of Walmart\u2019s desire for expansion of Walmart Pay and does that result in some shift in the way your business you know kind of continues as we go forward? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure Moshe. Why don\u2019t I start on the more financial question and then Margaret can talk on the latter one. Look, this program was somewhat unique in terms of the profile. That became a challenge for us from an economic standpoint. And in this case we just weren't able to earn a return that was in line with the credit risk of the portfolio. Under the old agreement we were earning an acceptable return for that risk. In the renewal discussions it became clear that we weren't going to be able to maintain that acceptable return level for the risk that we were taking. So look as we went through the process it became clear that either option that we've portrayed on that slide was accretive to what a renewal would have earned for us. And that combined with the risk sharing in the program, the credit risk profile of the portfolio, this became very challenging for us. And I'll just, Margaret. Margaret Keane : Yes, so I wouldn't say you know Moshe we\u2019re already in Walmart Pay and I think it\u2019s important to note and this is critical as we have another whole year with the program, so we're going to have to continue to support Walmart in every way we can and will continue to leverage Walmart Pay since our cards are in it. So we did, no go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : It's just a follow up, I mean PayPal also is available as a payment method on \u2013 at Walmart.com right? Margaret Keane : That's correct, so if the customer has one of our cards or the program with us it will be used wherever PayPal is accepting. So I don't believe and I think you're kind of leading to this thought of capabilities and our capabilities maybe versus Capital One. But we strongly believe that our capabilities are best in class and our continued investments in digital and data are really paying off for us and we're seeing this more and more with our partners as they're placing a much higher value on our capabilities particularly us this transformation is having to you know going to digital. So from our perspective, we felt like we could have delivered what Walmart wanted in terms of the digital transformation. As a matter of fact we put together a pretty incredible program that we thought we could continue to drive with them, but obviously as Brian said we couldn't get there on the economics. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Okay, thanks I'll get back in the queue. Margaret Keane : Thank you, Moshe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. Just to follow up on those questions, obviously you have a large secondary relationship with another entity owned by Walmart. I guess could you just talk about your appetite therefore to bid for that deal given your experience with this RFP and is there a reason to believe that that process will be handled any differently than this one was? Margaret Keane : Well, I'll start off by saying there are two separate contracts with two separate program agreements. The programs are different in terms of how they go to market just in terms of the Sam customer and being a little more business related then consumer related. Look we've had a long relationship with Sam's Club as well. That was also a startup. We've actually been with Sam's for 24 years. Look, I think our job right now is to continue to do the utmost servicing, delivering capabilities for Sam's and Walmart. I think at this point of us having that relationship for another year is really critical. One of the things we have to do as a company is really make sure we're delivering to the best of our ability for both Walmart and Sam's and then you know we're committed to doing that. And I think it's really important that we treat these customers really well. We're going to continue to be in Walmart stores. We're going to continue to be in Sam's Clubs and it's important for my team, our teams to deliver the best possible service we can do and continue to innovate with Sam's. So we're not going step back from that. So we would hope to renew Sam's and we're going to be in that process, we'll be aggressive and you know again I think the important point here is we don't have a bad relationship with Walmart. Our team has worked really well together with Walmart and Sam\u2019s. So we're going to leverage that and continue to leverage that and we're going to really take the high road here and make sure we do the best we possibly can for the programs. Sanjay Sakhrani : And I also just want to follow up on your answer to the last question for Moshe, just in terms of, I guess are you saying that the other issuers were just able to do the deal at lower economics than you were willing to go to and wasn't anything else? And then just maybe separately just in terms of offsetting the costs on this specific deal, how long can that continue to happen if other deals were to go the way Walmart did? Margaret Keane : So I would say look, we can't really comment on like the final negotiations between Walmart and Cap One. What we can tell you is that in our heart of hearts, we believe we have the same if not better capabilities. We could have delivered on all fronts that Walmart wanted us to deliver on. We just could not get there in terms of what our economic expectation was for the program. And I'd say that when you look at our other partners and our other renewals coming out we're very confident that this was a unique situation. We believe that our partners are valuing what we're delivering for them every single day. We continue to have partners come here in our innovation stations and in our offices in Chicago looking at all the capabilities we're delivering and we have confidence that we will be able to renew those relationships that are in the pipeline. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Maybe as a follow up on Sanjay\u2019s question, Margaret, I was just wondering can you talk about any efforts to accelerate with the renewal schedule of your next three or four biggest partners who are set to mature the next few years? I know in the past you've said you're always working towards renewal, but I was wondering if there's a specific effort to accelerate the renewal similar to what we saw another company do in the cobranded space after big partner lost that? Margaret Keane : I would say Ryan, we're always looking to renew and I wouldn't necessarily say we're accelerating, but I would tell you we're having very good conversations with our partners in terms of what they're looking for from a value proposition perspective, how they're looking to transform their digital footprint and what we can do for them. So I feel very positive that we'll continue to have a good track record and show as we've done historically that we can renew our deals. Ryan Nash : Got it and then just two small follow ups, first does Walmart loss it all change the strategic direction of the company and in particular make you think about a more diversified strategy such as being less reliant on individual partners and maybe it causes your return thresholds to differ as a more diversified company? And then second, just for the capital you're deploying the $2.5 billion in share repurchase or other higher returning options, if you maybe expand on what some of those other options would be and would that include M&A? Thanks for taking my questions. Margaret Keane : Sure, I will answer the first part and give the second part to Brian. So we are looking to diversify the business and we've actually been doing that. I think in particular, if you look at our PayPal and CareCredit business which are really both fast growing entities, we have lots of opportunity to diversify and continue to build out those platforms. And as a matter of fact as we do our 2019 planning we're really looking at ways to accelerate our opportunities in both of those platforms. We see tremendous opportunity with CareCredit and we're going to really leverage that platform to help us diversify the company. Brian Doubles : And then I would just add to that, obviously we're going to do that in a way where we're very disciplined around our return profile. So as we think about diversification, payment solutions, CareCredit, are great ways to diversify out of large program concentrations that we have today at very attractive returns. General purpose card is another way to diversify. Obviously we started to build out that strategy a little bit with what we did on Toys\"R\"Us. Depending on how Walmart goes, we would continue potentially down that path, and I think that's a nice way to diversify the portfolio at the same time doing it at very attractive returns. And then sorry Ryan, do you have one more? Ryan Nash : Yes I have just a follow up on you talked about $2.5 billion in share repurchase or other high returning options, I was just hoping maybe could you expand on what those options were and would it include M&A? Brian Doubles : Yes, so primarily that's bigger investments in some of our really fast growing programs, Amazon, T.J.Maxx, obviously PayPal, as well as investments in CareCredit payment solutions. But lastly I think we will take a harder look at M&A opportunities. We have a very active process around that. We've always had a very active process around that. We're very disciplined in that sense though around price and valuation. So I think you will see us take a harder look at that, but we're going to maintain our discipline and look for attractive entry points and good returns for shareholders. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Brian, a couple of questions around credit, on PayPal, can you talk a little bit about what percentage of that reserve bill is done in Q3 and sort of how the remainder will play out? I know you've talked about it in the past, but could you clarify that? And then also how much of a mark was on the PayPal portfolio? And then sort of a follow up to credit, it looks like the 30+ delinquencies in the core portfolio as why clearly trending while they're down year-over-year, but I think the later stage delinquencies didn't see that kind of improvement just want to get your thoughts on that? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure Don. Let me start with your last question because I think that kind of leads into some of what we're expecting to see on the reserves in the second half. So look, second quarter in terms of overall credit came in inline or slightly better than our expectations, so we didn't change our outlook for the full year. But I can tell you we're very encouraged by the delinquency trends that we're seeing across the portfolio. If you just look at the year-over year trends over the last four quarters, we are running anywhere between 27 basis points up to 54 basis points up and we saw our 30+ delinquencies come down year-over-year and now down 8 basis points. So we feel really good about what we're seeing on the portfolio. You obviously saw that flow through and a reserve build that was $121 million compared to our expectation of around $175 million. So things are trending in the right direction, vintages look good, we're seeing a good mix in terms of the sales. We're still seeing really good growth on sales on accounts above 720 FICO. So things trending in line and we feel if anything second quarter came in a little bit better than our expectation. In terms of the 90+ question they you had, we've always for the last year have been pretty clear that you're obviously going to see a first in 30+ then you're going to see at 90+ and then you'll see it in net charge offs. So this quarter you clearly saw it come through in 30+. We would expect 90+ next quarter, the quarter after and then obviously net charge offs are going to start to level off as well in the second half which is very much in line with what we said a year ago when we started just some of those modest tightening, so that's credit generally. So let me switch to the reserves and in terms of PayPal, so you have to remember on PayPal that you know the portfolio comes on without any reserves. It comes on at fair value, so we have to build that reserve basically from zero, the bulk of which occurs over the first nine to 12 months. And we will take more of that in the third quarter, it will come down a bit, in the fourth, will give you a sense for what we think that looks like next quarter. And then continue to build that reserve into the first half of 2019, but at smaller amounts. Obviously then you're going to see in the third quarter. So it's a little bit of a sliding scale, you take more of it upfront. The majority of that reserve is built within the first year. Donald Fandetti : And was there I guess, was there was a pretty modest mark on the portfolio for sort of [indiscernible]. Brian Doubles : Oh yes, sorry that was the last question, yes it was a pretty modest mark. If you go back to the guidance that we put out in January, you can see with and without PayPal our net charge off rate was unchanged at 55 to 58. So while there is a slight mark on PayPal it doesn't move us off of our full year NCO guidance. Donald Fandetti : Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. So we've been hearing some skepticism from investors about the $300 million to $350 million of expense sales you've identified in your strategic options, could you just kind of walk us through where you see those expenses sales coming from? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. The easiest way to think about this is those are the expenses that are really associated with the program. So you've got a combination of directly attributable costs related to the program and the portfolio and then you've got a portion of fixed costs that will come out as we right size the business for the portfolio leaving. So it's actually, it's fairly straightforward. I mean when we look at the business and we actually have, but we haven't had a lot of time to work on this. We have a fairly detailed plan. By function and we know where the costs come out when we look at right sizing the business for the portfolio moving. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. And then I was hoping you could clarify what's meant by both options being accretive to EPS relative to renewal terms. I'm assuming that means relative to the dilution you would have suffered under the economics that you would have had to accept to renew, but can you comment on whether this is also accretive to what you know consensus numbers might be for 2019 or 2020? Brian Doubles : Well, obviously I can't comment on the consensus, but what I can tell you is we know kind of where we stopped in the negotiating process and when we look at these two alternatives relative to that, these two options are EPS accretive. Does that make sense? Mark DeVries : Yes, okay but am I correct in my reading that it's - you're just saying it's accretive to what EPS would have been pro forma under the terms that you would have had to accept to renew? Brian Doubles : We believe it would have taken to renew, I think importantly though if you put that point aside, either of these options replace the EPS of the program. So EPS neutral to what the program was earning and accretive to what we believe a renewal would have cost us. Mark DeVries : Understood. Okay, thank you. Brian Doubles : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Good morning. Thanks for taking mine as well. A question focusing on maybe helping us better understand the stickiness of these programs in light of the renewal process and specifically. My understanding is that one of your public competitors has noted in the past that for non-cobrand for pure store card programs, they own all the data, the skew level transaction data, not the retailer. And I guess it's a three-part question. One is for your pure store card programs, do you own all of that data? Secondly, is there any data you retain that's yours not to retailers in dual card programs? And then thirdly maybe just remind us about the mix between the two for balances? Margaret Keane : So the retailer owns the data on the card programs. We do not own that data. I would say on dual card it\u2019s little different because there is in-store and out of store, so we do get the out of store data. And your third question was? David Scharf : Oh I\u2019m sorry, just I guess an update maybe pro forma Walmart terminating maybe with a mix of balances between a pure store card program versus dual card? Margaret Keane : I'll let Brian, answer that. Brian Doubles : So one other important point just on the data, so while the data is owned by the retailer or the program, we own all of the data analytics. We owned all the data models. We own all of the, what we consider data capabilities on the program. So the data moves but all of the analytics horse power and the capabilities obviously remain with us. David Scharf : And then just in terms\u2026 Brian Doubles : Does that make sense? David Scharf : Yes, no, no, no, that's very helpful. Yes. Brian Doubles : Yes, the mix specifically, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re asking specifically on Walmart, but Walmart is split roughly 50-50 dual card private label and then if you look at the split of spend on dual card it's about 60% of the spend is actually outside Walmart. David Scharf : Yes and actually if possible I was more curious on the mix pro forma Walmart leaving kind of the rest of the portfolio. Brian Doubles : It wouldn\u2019t change the mix of the company dramatically. it wouldn\u2019t significantly change that mix at all. David Scharf : Okay, thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Yep Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Rick Shane : Hey guys thanks for taking my question this morning. Hey Brian, when you walked through the Walmart numbers what you show was that proportionately NCOs are high, proportionally yields are high, proportionally RSAs are low. I'm curious proportionately about purchase volume and portfolio growth, so we can think about how to take that out going forward? Brian Doubles : Yes, I would think about absent Walmart that we're still back to our more historical growth rate. I don't think it changes our view on what we can do from a core growth standpoint. So I don't think it changes that mix either in terms of purchase volume, active accounts or receivables growth rate for the company. Rick Shane : And there's nothing unique related to Walmart in the relationship between purchase volume and loan growth? A - Brian Doubles There's not. I mean you can infer some things from what we've indicated on what it does to our loss or a little bit more of a revolving nature in that portfolio, but other than that it wouldn't be dramatic. And you have to remember I think importantly if the Walmart portfolio comes out in that scenario we just brought on PayPal which is a very high growth portfolio. So you have to think about those too kind of in conjunction. They are similarly sized programs. One is certainly you know what the growth rate is on PayPal because it's been disclosed over the last couple of years, very high growth, lots of opportunity going forward, so you've got to factor that in as well. Rick Shane : Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Kenneth Bruce : Thank you, good morning. Of the two options that you pointed out for the Walmart portfolio, do you have a preference for one outcome or the other? I understand you're not necessarily in control of it, but do you have a preference for which one you may be handed and/or are you agnostic to that and why? Brian Doubles : Yes, look and we feel pretty good about our ability to execute both options and in either situation we believe we can replace the EPS impact. The options are accretive to a renewal scenario and at this point either option looks attractive to us. We'll obviously know more as we work through the process to determine whether the portfolio is going to move or whether we will retain it. We will also get the more visibility around the potential gain if it's sold. So all of those things will kind of factor in here, but what I can say is that we feel pretty good about our ability to execute either option. Kenneth Bruce : Okay, well I guess the reason I ask is one obviously you export those customers and the other you retain some part of it to such a degree that you're trying to diversify your business away from that partnership concentration you've got a nice leg into a general purpose card in that case and so I hear that you're interested in building that, the second option may seem like a better alternative, just so I\u2019m just kind of asking if you have a preference one way or the other? Brian Doubles : That's exactly right. I think that the first option is more straightforward frankly. And the second option has a nice diversification angle to it that we like. And in both cases again we think we can execute either option, we can do it in a way to generates positive EPS result. Kenneth Bruce : Okay and then that in terms of the discussion around capabilities, I think I understand a lot of that kind of tends to be focused on the technology side of it at least that's how the some of the commentary pre the deal announced last night was being kind of talked about. One of the other aspects of it is credit capabilities in terms of Synchrony is willing this to go deep into a credit file in order to essentially kind of remain in some of these partnerships programs. Do you have any kind of comments there or thoughts around how, what your willingness is in order to expand that credit box to be able to remain competitive in these situations? Margaret Keane : You know, I think Brian said this before, I've said it before, for us it's really around the overall return of the program and we look at each of these contracts and programs and partnerships on that whole risk reward base. And I think in this case it was unique and we could not get to the overall return of the portfolio for Walmart that would mean what we thought was a return that we were willing to take. So I don't think it's really about the credit box, it's really about the overall return on a program and our ability to deliver for the partner. Brian Doubles : Yes, I mean as we said in the past like we have general underwriting guidelines that we apply across the entire business, but we also customize our underwriting by program by platform. So it's never been a one size fits all approach. We manage our programs to different loss rates based on the overall return as Margret said, that we're trying to achieve and we can do that in our programs using the customized underwriting. But at some point if you're not getting the return for the credit risk, you're taking then you know that becomes unattractive. Kenneth Bruce : Right, so you didn't tighten the box around the Walmart program and that might have kind of lead to that decision? Brian Doubles : No, I would not assume that. I mean the credit actions that we took over the past year and a half were fairly modest frankly and while they're having the desired result they were applied across pretty much the entire business. Kenneth Bruce : Okay, thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Brian, my question is has to do with your debt spreads, it looks like they've moved out about 40 or 50 basis points since July when I guess the Walmart things start to be discussed in a public market, can you just talk about the funding environment for you right now and if that spread widening creates any concerns or changes your outlook for funding cost over the near to medium term? Brian Doubles : Yes, it really doesn't create much of a concern for us. I think they are wider by maybe 35 basis points. We're very focused though as you know on deposit growth. That's our most attractive funding source. We're still seeing really good growth on deposits. We got very a strong franchise there that we continue to build out. So I think like any pressure that we see in the fixed income spreads in the unsecured or secured markets, we think we can offset and with higher deposit growth. So overall we don't think that's a big impact to how to think about net interest margins going forward. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: Yes, hi thanks for taking my question. Brian, I think in the last two calls you\u2019ve given some additional commentary around spend growth sort of parsed by kind of high cycle bucket and low cycle bucket, I don't know if you'd be willing to give us an update on that? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So very consistent this quarter with prior quarters, if you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification we continue to see really good growth in that 721 plus FICO range. So sales on those accounts was up 8% this quarter versus the prior year and then purchase volume on accounts below 650 FICO declined 13%, so very similar to prior periods. And again that's a - we still expect that to be a relatively short term phenomenon. I think we'll start to lap that in the first half of 2019 and you'll see that influence our overall growth rate for the company in a positive way. Matthew O'Neill: Got it and thanks. As a follow up I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the strategic direction around potentially getting further into general purpose card issuance, it makes sense around the Toys\"R\"Us portfolio and obviously if you were to retain the Synchrony portfolio and sorry the Walmart portfolio and start turning that into general purpose card you'd be more weighted in that direction versus some probably earlier comments about it being a bit of a competitive advantage with certain retailers that you guys aren\u2019t also kind of focused on your own general purpose card and the retailers partner card, just wondering what you think about that sort of dynamic going forward? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So look I think we're always interested in pursuing diversification opportunities if we can do it at attractive returns. And as we look at adjacencies to what we do today, this is a pretty close adjacency. So we think there's you know minimal execution risk. As you said, it's pretty competitive out there, particularly in the higher end, so I don't think that's where we would play, but we think we can carve out a very profitable niche for ourselves here. We're pretty confident given what the early returns on Toys\"R\"Us and some of the trends that we're seeing there that we can develop an attractive value proposition that works for a segment of the population. So we're seeing better activation on that portfolio than we thought we would. We're seeing good usage and so we think that this is a strategy for us longer term. We're going to be cautious and careful around it. We're going to continue to test on the accounts that we have today. And then as you think about you know that second option for Walmart, we do think that in that scenario we can convert a fairly significant number of those customers to a general purpose card. As I said earlier, about 50% of the Walmart portfolio today is a dual card, so they're kind of acting like a general purpose card already. And if you look at the spend on those cards it's about 60% outside of Walmart. So that gives us some comfort that there is a population there that we can convert and would be very receptive to a Synchrony branded card with a very attractive value proposition. Margaret Keane : And average of bad debt we have plenty of experience of people from the industry in our team and on our teams, so we're confident that we have the capability to really execute on that. Matthew O'Neill: Understood, thanks for the time. Greg Ketron : Hey Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you, Sir. Our last question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you, good morning. Does the focus on returning the $2.5 billion freed up by Walmart under the sale option in any way delay your ability to return the other call it roughly $2 billion of excess capital that you have or would you make every effort to get that out by 2019 as well? And in response to the earlier question about whether some of that, a portion of the $2.5 billion could be used for other alternatives, could you just confirm that spending on any other alternatives would not delay the replacement of the lost EPS? Brian Doubles : That's right. So were viewing the $2.5 billion as incremental to what we would have otherwise gone and asked for as part of a capital plan. So while we may include a portion of it in a capital plan in order to get formal approval from the board and our regulators, we are viewing that as incremental. We do expect to execute it in 2019. We think it will be done in the second half of 2019. We've had preliminary discussions with our board and our regulators on it. Obviously there will be a formal approval process that we have to go back around, but at this point we do feel pretty good about our ability to execute it. Bill Carcache : Okay and then as a follow up, is there anything unique to the Walmart portfolio that allows you guys to fully offset its loss via buyback and to what extent would you be able to summarily offset the loss of other portfolios if they were to happen? Brian Doubles : Without getting too specific, I think in all of these cases whether it's Toys\"R\"Us, whether it's Walmart we have options at our disposal to offset the EPS impact or at least mitigate a substantial portion of it through the strategies or similar strategies that we've outlined here for Walmart. So look, I think what's important is we have options available. We can execute those options. We feel comfortable with them and they give us a nice EPS offset. Bill Carcache : So contractually like it is just reasonable to conclude that your agreements broadly speaking put you in a position to be able to mitigate the loss of any portfolio should they happen is the general rule? Brian Doubles : Most of our contracts would play out similar to this one in that either the portfolio moves to a new issuer or we retain it and we would run a similar strategy to what we're proposing here and convert the cards to a Synchrony branded product or I should say you know potentially another program in the company. So it does depend a little bit on the contract, but the financial outcome would be very similar. Bill Carcache : Got it, thank you very much for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Thanks Bill. Greg Ketron : Okay, thanks everyone for joining us on the call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide three. Our performance were strong across several key business drivers in the third quarter, broad based growth helps drives earnings of $671 million or $0.91 per share. Loan receivables grew 14% and we generated strong net interest income growth of 9%. Purchase volume increased 11% and average active accounts were up 9%. As you know, we completed our acquisition of the PayPal Credit program in the third quarter and that is now included in our results. Brian will discuss some of the associated impacts later in the call. We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and added some exciting new partnerships. In our Retail Card sales platform, we extended our strategic partnership with Lowe, building on a nearly four decade long relationship. As part of this extension, we will continue to manage and service both their consumer and commercial credit card programs. A key focus for the program is making the consumer experience even easier by further advancing technological capabilities to enhance the digital experience for Lowe's customer, tapping the power of mobile for areas such as payments and applications. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Lowe's, to help them grow sales and enhance their customers' experience. We are also very pleased to renew our partnership with JCPenney. This nearly two decade long partnership has been very successful with high engagement. Working together we have leveraged data analytics to uncover new customer insights, further personalizing the customer experience. We have also helped JCPenney integrate credit payments into their mobile app. The deep collaboration between us has already proven to benefit customers across all shopping channels and we will continue to leverage advance data analytics to help drive even better experiences for card holders. We have been able to add significant value to the program in a dynamic market environment and look forward to continuing the strategic partnership with JCPenney. In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we renewed key relationships with Associated Materials, a leading manufacturer and distributor of exterior residential building products and Generac, a leading supplier of backup power and prime power products systems and engine power tools. We also signed some exciting new programs during the quarter. In Payment Solutions we added a new partnership with Fred Myers Jewelers, a national jewelry chain and in CareCredit we added a new partnership with Eargo a hearing aid manufacturer. Over the past several quarters we have broaden the scope of our valuable CareCredit network adding more than 25 new specialties where the card is accepted. Our focus on expanding CareCredit's utility has led to the acceptance of the card in medical specialties including primary care and general practice, physical therapy, ambulatory surgery, durable medical equipment and urgent care. The Care credit card can be used for deductibles, co-pays, planned medical procedures, annual wellness visits, imaging and other out of pocket costs. As you know expanding acceptance in utility of the successful card and network has been a key objective for us as we strive to move these cards to the top of the cardholders' wallet, migrating towards more repeat purchase behavior. To that end, we have made substantial progress in improving the usage of our cards as evidenced by our reuse rates. For CareCredit the reuse rate in the third quarter was 53% and for Payment Solutions it was 29% of total purchase volume. Ease of application and use of our cards while in trying that cardholders have access to their cards, rewards and account information across whatever channel they choose to use is critical. As the mobile channel becomes particularly important to retailers and their customers who are using apps to make purchases and much more, we have developed tools to ensure our cardholders can easily utilize their cards in this increasingly popular channel. SyPi our mobile plug-in application is an example of an investment we made to expand our mobile engagement capabilities and where we are receiving a very positive response from our retail partners. SyPi is currently being used in 19 of our retail partners' apps including GAP, Lowe's and JCPenney and recently crossed over 1 billion in credit card bill payments since the product's launched in 2016. Comparing September of this year to last year, the number of visits, unique visitors and total payments have increased over 200%. Our overall digital sales penetration for our retail card consumers have been growing. Digital sales penetration was 33% in the third quarter. 46% of applications are happening online with the mobile channel alone growing 59% over the same quarter of last year. Overall, this was a strong quarter for us. We continue to generate organic growth and renew and extent important relationships, while also adding new programs, extending the utility of our cards and focusing on digital innovations to further improve the customer experience. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I will give a quick review on how each of our sales platforms performed during the quarter, which is on slide five of the presentation. In Retail Card, strong results were driven by our PayPal Credit program acquisition, along with continued organic growth. Loan receivables increased 16% and interest and fees on loans increased 12% over last year. Purchase volume grew 11% and average active accounts were up 10%. As I noted earlier, we had a very active quarter in our Retail Card sales platform with the renewal and expansion of the Lowe's and JCPenney program. We are very excited about these significant relationships and their future potential. Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. We generated broad based growth across the sales platform, with particular strength in home furnishings and power products that resulted in loan receivables growth of 9%. Interest and fees on loans increased 8%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts increased 5%. We are pleased to have added the Fred Meyer Jewelers partnership and to renew our programs with Associated Materials, and Generac. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 8% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interests and fees on loans also increased 6%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 9% and average active accounts increased 5%. Expanding into new specialties thereby increasing utility of the CareCredit card is helping to drive performance. We are pleased to add new partnerships including Eargo. We are also making investments such as enhancing the mobile app to continue to support the network and its growth potential. We continue to deliver solid growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter and we are extending relationships, signing new programs and providing value added solutions to our partners and cardholders. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I will make a quick comment about Wal-Mart. Though we currently have no updates to provide, I want to emphasize that we continue to work closely with Wal-Mart to support the program. And we'll do everything on our end to ensure a successful program transition next year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning we reported third quarter earnings of $671 million, which translates to $0.91 per diluted share. In addition to adding the PayPal Credit portfolio this quarter, we continue to deliver solid growth with loan receivables up 14% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 10% over last year. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk adjusted returns on this growth. The interest and fee income growth were driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 11% over last year and average active account growth was 9%. The positive trends continued in average balances with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year. We're also pleased to have announced the extension of both the Lowe's and JCPenney programs. In both cases, we are able to renew these relationships at attractive risk adjusted returns. While in both cases, we made some modest changes to the economic sharing in these programs. The earnings profile for us going forward will be very similar to our current run rate on these programs. We were also able to enhance some of the growth commitments and value propositions in the programs, as well as some of the contractual protections we have, which will improve our risk profile and benefit us over the long-term. At the end of the day these are very good renewals for us with improved alignment on growth and very attractive risk adjusted returns. RSAs increased $66 million or 8% from last year, excluding the impact of adding the PayPal Credit portfolio, the primary drivers of the increase for growth and lower provision expense. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4% for the quarter compared to 4.2% last year. For the fourth quarter we expect the RSAs to be around 4% compared against the third quarter, the RSA will be driven by improving credit trends, partially offset by the seasonal decline we typically see in the fourth quarter. The provision for loan losses increased $141 million or 11% from last year, driven by the PayPal Credit reserve build, partially offset by moderating credit trends. The reserve build in the quarter was $364 million, including $272 million associated with adding the PayPal portfolio and $92 million related to the core portfolio. The reserve build was lower than our expectations as credit performance was better than we had expected. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation. Other income was down $13 million, while interchange was up $18 million driven by continued growth in out of store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that increased $28 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs. So there's a partial offset on each of these items. As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $96 million or 10% versus last year, driven primarily by expenses related to on-boarding the PayPal Credit program, as well as expenses related to growth. We expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by the impact of adding the PayPal program until we are comparing against quarters with PayPal and the run rate. We will also continue to make strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline the back office. So overall, the company generated solid performance for the third quarter, especially considering the reserve build related to adding the PayPal portfolio. Moving to slide seven, I will cover net interest income and margin performance for the quarter. Net interest income was up 9%, driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal portfolio and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.41%, compared to last year's margin of 16.74%. The margin was mainly in line with our expectations. The largest impact on margin performance was the impact of the PayPal portfolio acquisition. As expected the margin increased from last quarter's level of 15.33% as the liquidity resulting from pre-funding was deployed when the PayPal portfolio was added on July 2nd. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year. As we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we're holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition and receivables growth. Also impacting the margin was a decline in the loan receivables yield and an increase in interest bearing liability cost. The loan receivables yield was 21.11%, a decline of 67 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. The increase in total interest bearing liabilities costs was 43 basis points to 2.36%, reflecting higher benchmark rates. We expect to see the normal seasonal decline in yield in the fourth quarter given the build and receivables during holiday season. This has been as much as 50 to 60 basis points historically. As a result, we expect the net interest margin to trend down into the 15.75% to 16% range in the fourth quarter, which is in line with our outlook for margins to be in the 16% range for the second half of the year. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate improved a 4.59%, compared to 4.80% last year and the 90 plus delinquency rate declined to 2.09% and 2.22% last year. The year-over-year trends in both the 30 plus and 90 plus delinquency rates were stable to improving for the second quarter in a row with the 30 plus delinquency right now 21 basis points below the prior year, reflecting the impact of our underwriting refinements and a more modest impact for normalization. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 4.97%, compared to 4.95% last year and in line with our expectations. While the net charge-off rate benefited from the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio, the credit trends in the core portfolio also continue to moderate. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.11% and the reserve build from the second quarter was $364 million. As I noted earlier the reserve build was lower than our expectations due to the improving credit trends resulting from the underwriting refinements we made. The core reserve build was $92 million and the reserve build on the PayPal portfolio acquired in the quarter was $272 million, both below our expectations. As we have been noting in recent quarters, we continue to see favorable trends resulting from the impact related to the underwriting refinements on two key metrics; our more recent vintages, and our purchase volume growth. First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. The vintage curve data suggest that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. And while it is still early to fully assess the 2018 vintage trends, the results so far are similar 2017. These underwriting refinements continue to drive changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification excluding the impact of the acquired PayPal portfolio, we continue to grow at a fairly strong pace and accounts with a FICO score of 721 and higher, which increased 11% over the same quarter last year. While purchase volume for accounts of FICO score is of 660 and below, actually declined 12%, reflecting some of the modest tightening we have been doing. These trends help and form our view of loss expectations for this year and beyond. Looking forward, we typically see a seasonal uptick in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and continue to expect net charge-offs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for 2018. Regarding reserve build for the fourth quarter, we expect the reserve build on our existing or core portfolio to continue to transition to be more growth driven and will be in the $75 million to $100 million range next quarter. We expect the reserve build related to the PayPal Credit portfolio due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions will result in an additional reserve build in the $125 million to $150 million range, for a total reserve build in the $200 million to $250 million next quarter. In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results to continue to moderate as we move forward, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $1.1 billion, up 10% over last year and were primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program and growth. The efficiency ratio was 31% for the quarter versus 30.4% last year and in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of strategic investments. We continue to expect the efficiency ratio to be in the 31% range for 2018. Moving to slide 10, the key highlights are maintaining our funding mix and strong liquidity and capital levels, while on-boarding the PayPal portfolio. We also made progress in deploying capital to our capital plans and growth by executing the capital plan we announced in May, which increased our dividends and the size of our share repurchases through June of next year. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity profile. Over the last year we have grown our deposits nearly $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This was a key component of our funding strategy for the PayPal portfolio. This puts deposits at 72% of our funding maintaining the level we have been operating at over the last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program, by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building at our digital capabilities. Longer term we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. On the wholesale funding side, we were pleased to do our first public issuance out of the newly established Synchrony Card Issuance Trust during the quarter. The issuance had strong demand and we ended up issuing 1 billion in three year fixed rate funding. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 14.2% CET 1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.2% on a fully phased in basis last year, a 300 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio growth and continued execution of our capital plan. During the quarter we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.21 per share and repurchased $966 million of common stock during the third quarter. This represented 30.3 million shares repurchase during the quarter, more than double the amount of shares we have been averaging in the prior four quarters. We have approximately $1 billion remaining in potential share repurchases of the $2.2 billion our Board authorized through the fourth quarters ending June 30, 2019. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $23 billion, which equated to 22% of our total assets. This is down from 24% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet, with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view for the fourth quarter and the year. First, regarding our margin outlook, we expect to see normal seasonal decline in yield in the fourth quarter given the build and receivables during holiday season. This has been as much as 50 to 60 basis points historically. As a result, we expect the net interest margin to trend into the 15.75% to 16% range in the fourth quarter in line with our outlook that the margin would run in the 16% range for the second half of this year. We expect RSAs to be around 4% in the fourth quarter. Regarding credit, we continue to expect net charge offs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for the year with the typical seasonal uptick in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. We expect the reserve build on our existing or core portfolio to continue to transition to be more growth driven and will be in the $75 million to $100 million range next quarter. We expect the reserve build related to the PayPal Credit portfolio due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions will result in an additional reserve build in the $125 million to $150 range, for a total reserve build in the $200 million to $250 million range next quarter. Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. In summary, the business continues to generate good growth with attractive long-term returns. And while the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition creates a degree of EPS dilution in the half of this, we expected to be an EPS accretive in 2019 and help provide a nice tailwind to EPS as we move forward. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. We generated strong results this quarter, significantly expanding our relationship with PayPal with the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program, while also continuing to drive organic growth. We renewed key partnerships and signed exciting new programs. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities and network, focusing on ease of card use across platforms as well as card utility, enhancing our competitive position in the rapidly changing marketplace. We are also seeing other important elements of our business, such as credit quality perform in line with our expectations. All of this contributes to our ability to return capital to shareholders and we were pleased to increase our dividend and share repurchases this quarter. We are also focused on aligning capital through organic growth and program acquisitions. We focus on risk adjusted returns, while pursuing strategies that help us to profitably grow the business and deliver value. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First, Margaret, you did refer to the Wal-Mart working with them to ensure the most I guess seamless transition. In the prior call as you guys have talked about various options, I'm wondering can you give us an update on how you proceed with those options and maybe give us some clarification on when you might have a final decision to make. Margaret Keane : Sure. We're not through those options. So what I'd say is we really can't give you a reflection of which one it is, but we're working closely with them now on working through valuation and we expect to have clarity by the first quarter. I think what we said in the last call is that either option whether the portfolio transitions to another issuer or whether we keep the portfolio, both cases we believe that we can replace the EPS, so focused on working with them, focused on getting to a place that we can have a final decision in the first quarter. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks. And then and then PayPal, I guess a couple of kind of details of PayPal, were there any one time expenses this quarter tied to kind of on-boarding that portfolio? Brian, you've given some guidance about Q4 ALL build will there be any other ALL build next year? And then how do we think about kind of the integration of those credit metrics, I guess, the NCO trajectory, as that seasons into the calendar year of 2019? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, John. So I wouldn't say they're really any one time expenses related to that. We did do some upfront spending before we brought the portfolio on, just to get a team in place to manage it. You saw some of that actually in the second quarter, a little more this quarter. But, other than that, I would say that where you're seeing an impact on the expenses is really running through professional fees, which you saw increase, that's really driven by the interim servicing until our team takes that over in full. And so you'll see that expense come down as we get into kind of the first half of 2019. And then that will be replaced by true employee costs on our side as we take over the full kind of operation of that portfolio. In terms of the ALLL, I mean, it came in right in line with our expectations if anything, it was a little bit better. So the reserve came in at $272 million that was better than we expected. Overall, we're very pleased with the credit trends that we're seeing on PayPal, so no change to the full year net charge-off guidance. If you remember, just due to some of the purchase accounting on PayPal, we gave you guidance with and without, so 5.5% to 5.8% with and without PayPal. So it moved us around within the range, but wasn't significant enough to change the range for the full year. And that outlook is still good. So I'm sorry, John, do you have one more? John Hecht : Yes, I guess just given the on-boarding process and the accounting associated with it, when should we see the PayPal charge-off trends, you influence the overall book? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So I would think about PayPal, you kind of burn off that mark pretty quick in the remainder of this year, and then you'll start to see some upward bias in the net charge-off rate as we move into 2019, just given the overall credit profile of PayPal relative to our book. So think about it not having much of an impact as we get through 2018. And then some modest upward bias in the net charge-off rate for 2019, which obviously we'll give you more color on that when we do our outlook for the full year. John Hecht : Okay. Appreciate it guys. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Margaret, there's been a little bit of investor discussions of maybe Cap One isn't super excited to buy the portfolio. I know you can't comment on that deal specifically, but can you help us understand, when you win deals historically, besides just getting the net interest income, what are some of the other reasons, why you want to buy that portfolio, is it data, things of that nature? And then the second part of the question would be, if you do sell it and you move forward with the buybacks, could you also make a sizable portfolio acquisition if one were to come up that was unique or do you feel like you're super committed to the buybacks and that would probably limit your ability? Margaret Keane : Yes, so I think the first part I would comment on, probably the most important aspect of buying a book is really around the customer. What you really want to do is ensure that smooth transition from one issuer to another. So as we think about when we do an acquisition particularly of a big book that would be something that would be really important for us because one the customer keeping that transition smooth, keeping the card is utility going. You point on data and analytics, all those elements are extremely important. So those would be the things that we would be focusing on in terms of an acquisition of a portfolio. In terms of, could we purchase a portfolio, obviously, yes, we have said that's been one of our strategies all along in terms of how we would deploy capital, similar to how we did PayPal. But obviously would have to be at the right return, the right risk adjusted margin so that we drive the bottom-line the way we want for the company. I don't know Brian if you would add. Brian Doubles : Yes, Don, the only thing I would add is when we communicated our plan on both options last quarter, we did indicate that share repurchases and higher returning alternative. So that would include portfolio acquisitions obviously, we're looking at making bigger investments in the organic growth of the business to investing in high growth programs like PayPal, like TJX, more investment in CareCredit and Payment Solutions. But then if something came along as Margaret said, with the right risk adjusted returns and attractive portfolio acquisition, we would absolutely take a look at it. Donald Fandetti : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. Yes, I have two model related questions for Brian and then one for Margaret. Just on the model questions, Brian, the RSA coming in better than expected as a percentage of receivables despite the renewals and better credit, is that a good run rate to think about going forward as we look into next year? And then secondly on the PayPal allowance build. Is there a way to think about how much of the portfolio you have reserved for by the end of the year based on what you're expecting? I just want to think about how much more needs to be reserved for, as we move into next year given the accounting. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Sanjay. So first on the RSAs, the RSAs came in a little bit better than we expected, that's been a trend all year. In the quarter, what really drove that was some program mix that we're seeing better growth, higher growth and programs where we pay a lower RSA percentage so that was a big driver. And then obviously we are no longer making payments on the Toys\"R\"Us program. And then the other factor is we did have slightly lower yield just given the improvement in the credit trends, lower delinquencies. And so that drives a little less revolve lower interest and fees, et cetera. So, that's what really drove the result in the quarter. And then as you think about the fourth quarter, it probably worth just commenting on a couple drivers there, we expect it will coming around the same 4% level. Part of that's driven by credit continuing to improve, so that results in a higher RSA. And then as you probably remember we have that normal seasonality we see moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which brings the RSA back down. So, couple of puts and takes that gets you back into that, gets you back into that 4% range. So then on the PayPal reserves, again it came in a little bit better than we expected just given the credit trends that we're seeing on that portfolio for the quarter. We gave you a pretty good indication of what to expect for the fourth quarter. When you add both of those up you are in that $400 million range. And if you go back and look at the size of the portfolio that we disclosed there is some information out there in terms of what PayPal disclosed on the loss rate for that portfolio. If you assume 14 to 15 months coverage on that, you assume that we get about 400 million done this year. That gives you a pretty good indication of what to expect for 2019 in order to complete that build. So, nothing specific at this point, but I think you have got most of the pieces just given that to come up with a pretty good estimate. And the way I would think about it moving through 2019, obviously it should continue to come down. So you saw $272 million, you got our guidance for the fourth quarter that will come down, it will come down a bit more in the first quarter and then kind of prorate through the balance of 2019. Sanjay Sakhrani : And I am sorry, one more. The delinquency rate, was that impacted by PayPal in anyway? Brian Doubles : Yes, actually the core 30 plus delinquency rate was a little bit better than we reported, so better than the 21 basis points down year-over-year, with a partially offset for PayPal. So PayPal brought it up a few basis points. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. And then Margaret, just following up on the discussion on portfolio acquisitions, one of your competitors is considering strategic alignment - realignments and that might create an opportunity that buy a sizable smaller portfolio, a private label relationship. Could you just talk about your appetite, if something like that were to come up? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Obviously we take a look, but we'd have to evaluate what the overall portfolio was what we would like to be part of in that portfolio and it's hard for us to really comment on that, given that that's not really out there yet. But obviously if we did, we would obviously take a look. Sanjay Sakhrani : Right, thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I had a question on the mechanics under a portfolio sale. If you were to say move the portfolio to held for sale at the end of Q1, is that reasonable to expect at that point you'd to hold only four months of allowance through the July 31st portfolio transfer date and would look to use the benefits of those reserve releases to start incremental buybacks even before the portfolio officially goes away. Brian Doubles : Yes, that's more or less how it works. So the point at which we have confirmation that the portfolio is going to transition or move off of our balance sheet we would move it to held for sale it start to shorten that reserve period between the time once you move in and the time you expect to transfer it. So that's a pretty reasonable assumption, Bill. Bill Carcache : Okay, great. Thank you. And I had a follow-up question on renewal risk for you, Margaret. For many years you guys were able sustain very attractive through the cycle risk adjusted margins inside of GE, but today many investors are questioning whether there really is a secret sauce and some believe your larger competitors can simply swooped in and take away your customers when the contracts come up to renewal. This loss of the partnerships and RSA pressure wasn't something that we saw when you guys were inside of GE. So what is it that is fundamentally changed since you guys went public that makes this a greater risk now, or is it not if you could just comment on that that would be helpful? Margaret Keane : Sure. We don't see it as a great risk. I view Wal-Mart as an outlier. I think if you just look at what we've done in this month where we've renewed Lowe's so by the way we'll have over four decades, and the fact that we've renewed JCPenney, which we have for two decades. I think our experience and our trends have shown that we can renew deals. So I'm not sitting here saying that all of a sudden there is a big competitive shift. Look, our view is we're one of the best private label issuers. We know how to service the retail marketplace. We've built out a ton of capabilities, and honestly I view Wal-Mart as an outlier. Brian Doubles : Hey, Bill, the other thing I would just point out, if you go back to the last round of renewals that we did, those were all done with the knowledge that we were going to separate from GE. So we're really in kind of the second or third wave of renewals. And as Margaret said, we think about Wal-Mart as an outlier. Our track record on renewals has been very strong with and without GE. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful, thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. When we think about credit performance, obviously the primary driver is FICO score and credit quality. But one of the other influential factors is utility. I'm curious when you think about the PayPal product versus your core private label. If there is utility factor that you think will influence credit performance related to delinquencies and charge-offs over the longer term. Brian Doubles : Yes, Rick, I mean certainly that's a factor I would say broadly across the portfolio. But I wouldn't say that PayPal is unique relative to other products and other programs that we have. I think the elements that you talked initially drive more of the performance. So whether it's the FICO even though we don't use really to underwrite we use it to score the portfolio. Our proprietary scores are really the primary driver in terms of what we expect to see on overall credit performance. So to factor but I wouldn't highlight anything unique on PayPal. Rick Shane : Got it. So when you differentiate the performance for PayPal versus your core portfolio, what do you think the primary factor is? Brian Doubles : I would say I will go back to what I said it's the overall credit profile and how we underwrite that portfolio relative to others. I think as we've talked about in the past, if you look at all of our programs, we underwrite based on a set of overall guidelines overall parameters, but then we drill down into the individual program level. And we underwrite a little bit differently based on the customer mix, the customer profile that through the door population in terms of who is apply for credit. And it's a combination of all those factors that mosaic that gives us the overall credit performance that we target for that program. Rick Shane : Okay, great. Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thank you. Was interested in hearing how you thought about the potential trade-offs of renegotiating Lowe's well in advance of - and when that was up in an environment where presumably it's quite competitive and you may have to give away some economics to renew versus the ability to kind of push out some of the renewal risk on that relationship? Brian Doubles : Yes, I think we have been pretty clear, Mark, that we're always working to renew all of our big partners and if we can do that outside of a competitive process and do in a way where we protect our return profile and our economics and do in a way that we get some really good alignment around growth or change some things around the value prop or acquisition incentives and that's always something we're looking to do and we have got a pretty good track record of doing that. So I wouldn't say there is anything unique in either the - into the Lowe's or the JCPenney renewals, I think these things naturally happen as part of these relationships. Mark DeVries : Okay. Where there any enhancements made to the value prepositions around out of the cards in those renewal programs? Brian Doubles : What I would say and I can't get too specific, but in all of these cases when you early renew typically there is some puts and takes in terms of the economics and what we're going to do in terms of the value prop and acquisition incentive. And in both cases JCPenney or Lowe's we got some really nice commitments around growth and some things that we're going to change, but nothing that's been announced at this point. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric perhaps you're muted on your end. Eric Wasserstrom : Yes, I am sorry, can you hear me now? Brian Doubles : Yes. Eric Wasserstrom : Yes, sorry about that. Just Brian, one question on PayPal and then a follow-up on Wal-Mart. On the PayPal portfolio other than credit performance which you've already guided to a little bit for the fourth quarter, now that you have seen it perform for about one quarter. Is there anything about it, that is behaving differently than your expectation? Brian Doubles : No, I'd say it's performing very much in line with our expectations, I would maybe point to credit performance being a touch better than we thought, that's what drove the lower reserve build, the turn of books slightly different what we thought, but overall we're very pleased with the performance and it's pretty much in line with our expectation. So, we're pretty excited to get focused on growth. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you for that. And then just to follow-up on Wal-Mart and I appreciate that you have already talked a lot about it and you're still in the midst of this negotiation. But is it your baseline assumption that the portfolio will be sold or are you still pursuing each avenue on like a 50-50 probability for example? Margaret Keane : We're still on discussion, so we - I wouldn't put any kind of 50-50 or anything on it. I think we're working closely with Wal-Mart again, our job is to come to a conclusion in the first quarter and whatever the decision is, we are committed to really ensuring a smooth transition and really delivering for Wal-Mart through the end of the contract. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: Yes, hi thanks for taking my questions. I think basically two for Brian. The first around the underwriting refinements that seem to start in earnest this year and the results you discussed regarding the performance above sort of 720, 721 and 660 and below. I was wondering if that's a trend that we should kind of continue to expect beyond 2018? And maybe just a high level view on kind of loan growth outlook as a result. And then if I could for a follow-up, one of your smaller competitors commented recently around seeing minimal if any impacts from CCIL. And I was just wondering if you could comment on that regarding your business? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So first on the underwriting changes, I think our expectation is that we're going to start to lap those periods at some point probably towards the end of the first half of 2019. So I think that trend continues for a couple more quarters and then some of that comes down you get back to a more what we will consider a core growth rate. But overall I think we're very pleased with the results of those underwriting refinements. I think we told you about a year ago that we expected the credit trends to start to moderate and level-off in the second half of 2018. And if anything the performance has been in line to slightly better than that. So, we're still seeing really good volume on accounts greater than 720 as we indicated. And what we're seeing on the accounts below 660 FICO was very, very targeted, very intentional, and it's having the desire results. And I think if you look across, whether it's a reserve build or the delinquency metrics, everything is performing in line to slightly better than we thought. So I think as you move into 2019, you start to lap some of those periods and you start to see those, the impact on purchase volume level off a bit. And then your second question just on CCIL, I think there's obviously still a lot of work to do here. Most credit card issuers would say it's going to result in some increasing level of reserves. Just going from an incurred loss model for lifetime losses, I think the vast majority of issuers are expecting some level of increase. But there is still a lot that's undecided at this point. You've got to determine the life of the revolving product. Depending on which payment allocation methodology you pick, you get a different answer. Frankly, this is, it's fairly challenging accounting guidance to apply to revolving credit. So look, we're doing a lot of work on this, we're participating in all the industry groups and talking to other issuers. Our teams internally are hard at work modeling this. We got six to nine months to kind of run in parallel here and when we have an estimate of the impact we'll certainly share it with all of you. Matthew O'Neill: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Coffey with Susquehanna. James Friedman : It's Jamie, for John. Thanks for taking my question. But periodically, Margaret, you would give e-commerce related disclosure. I was wondering if you had something equivalent that you could share so we can kind of mark your progress with that. And maybe I'll just ask my second one upfront, in case you don't happy to have that one. So, if you could talk at least qualitatively about the deal pipeline for 2019 and 2020, as is been alluded to one of your competitors has talked rather enthusiastically about the potential contribution coming up from new opportunities. How does it look out there? And is there a lot of opportunity for you guys? Thank you. Margaret Keane : Sure. So I would say that, we're very focused on continuing to assent digital capabilities. I think this is an area that we know becomes a critical part for our partners. And so our year-over-year mobile growth was 59% and our online penetration for Retail Card was 33%, which was up 9 percentage points. James Friedman : Thank you. Margaret Keane : And about 46% of our applications occurred digitally in the third quarter. So certainly our mobile enhancements and capabilities and things we continue to build out are having a really good impact. On the pipeline, we feel good about the pipeline. I would say there's not one big deal out there right now, other than maybe some of the rumors that were started this week. So we'd have to look at that. But I think what we've been very diligent on is looking at new startups and existing programs and winning across all three platforms. And we feel good about the progress we make and what the pipeline looks like, I could say going into 2019, I really can't comment on what's going to be beyond that. But again, we're focused on all three platforms Retail Card being one of the ones we talked a lot about. But we've been able to win very successfully in our Payment Solutions business. And I think CareCredit, we continue to expand with utility of the card, as well as expanding our partnership and expansion into new verticals. So we feel, we're poised for a strong pipeline going forward. James Friedman : Okay, appreciate the color. I'll jump back into the queue. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. We have our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just want to focus on the margin for a minute, you noted that you're expected to decline back into the 15.75% to 16% range. Just wanted to get a little more color around, is that just sort of liquidity portfolio being build backup or is there anything actually pressuring the margin. And one sort of related question on the component parts, if I look at the consumer loan yield and your detail our average balance reconciliation, looks like the consumer loans here was actually relatively flat sequentially, so it's obviously a little bit surprised I thought you'd see a little more of impact from PayPal. Is there any accounting related sort of impact in there that makes it look flatter or does it actually 21.5 a good number for the PayPal portfolio? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So maybe I'll take the second one first. So if you look at the yield in the quarter, it was down driven by the PayPal acquisition obviously largely promotional balances they do come on with a lower yield. And then we also had I think as I indicated earlier a modest decline in interest and fees that was similar to what you'd expect just given the improving delinquency trends. There was a slight reduction in yield just driven by purchase accounting that's pretty standard that burns off over the next couple of quarters. But other than that, and some of the noise related to PayPal I would say the core margins the core yield is very stable. And then as you move from the third to the fourth quarter, just the seasonal decline in yield that we see has been up to 60 basis points in the past. And so that's really what you're seeing as you move from the third to the fourth is that seasonal declines you put on a lot of holiday balances that aren't necessarily earning as you put them on. And so that drives that seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. So other than that the core margins are pretty stable. And for the full year, we're right on top of that range that we gave you back in January for margins to be in that 15.75% to 16% range. Chris Brendler : Okay. Probably a little early to comment on 2019, but if you could, it feels like these trends should continue into 2019. The one thing I was worried about in this quarter was pretty sizable increase in deposit costs looks like it was up on 18 basis points sequentially. But you also grew deposits pretty rapidly this quarter. So I'm wondering if maybe you hit the gas a little bit on deposits to help fund PayPal and that should settle down a little bit in terms of costs increases as you go into 2019. Brian Doubles : Yes, I mean, nothing specific to give on 2019 margins at this point. But I think your comments are in line. So I would say that we were very competitive all year on deposits and pricing just to prefund PayPal. And so you're going to feel the effects of that for a few quarters. But our expectation is that we won't have to be as competitive as we move into 2019 that was very unique to having to prefund the PayPal transaction. Chris Brendler : Great, thanks so much. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Dominic Gabriel with Oppenheimer. Dominic Gabriel : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask previous question in maybe a different way. Could you see yourself look to expand partnerships with much smaller retailers than you've typically in the past have gone after. Is there - could there be a strategy shift there, where that could be a renewed focus of some sort? Margaret Keane : Well, I think if you really look at our business we actually do deals smaller retailers particularly in our Payment Solutions platform. That's where we have a number of smaller retailers, but even in the Retail Card, depending on the retailer, we really can run the gamut from small to big. So again if the right opportunity came up it was the right partnership to get involved with, we would certainly look at it. Dominic Gabriel : Okay, great. Thank you so much. And then real quick, just wanted to get a little more detail around the renewals; you mentioned something about maybe the tender share. Is there a chance that on those two renewals that the tender share was somehow limited at some point and now you're - they've kind of unshackled you almost to say where you can now grow within the total sales of those businesses at a faster rate than you've previously? Okay. Margaret Keane : No, the goal is always to grow the sales. It's always more beneficial for our partners to grow sales on their cards if you will to Lowe's to grow on the Lowe's card and JCPenney to grow on the JCPenney card. Because remember, they don't pay any share in the RSAs. And then the other big positive is really around the data analytics around the customers that are using a card. So we've never been shackled by how much. We always want to grow that penetration to as high as we possibly can. So - and I think what we were saying here is that as we continue to build out more capabilities and leverage some of our capabilities partnering with them, that just gives us a lot more opportunity as we go into these renewals. Dominic Gabriel : Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Greg Ketron : Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : And thank you. Our last question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. I guess there was a lot of talk about the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio. But could you talk a little bit about your experience in the portfolios where you've kind of gone on your own after a partner and how that has worked and how we could think about this if it were to go in that direction and the portfolio was not sold? Margaret Keane : Yes, I think we have two probably current examples. The first is when Hhgregg did result because they went bankrupt, we converted those cards to a new network, we created call the home network. But the other good example is Toys\"R\"Us, I mean, obviously we took - we kept that portfolio again because of the bankruptcy and converted that to a general purpose credit card. But I would just generally say whenever a portfolio stays with us over the years, whether it didn't convert or there was a bankruptcy of some sort, we always look at ways to convert those cards, so they can be continue to be utilized. So we have processes in places to really make sure we can transfer them to even new programs, or in the one case we created a network. So we feel pretty positive that we can handle either case if we Wal-Mart were to go, or to stay, I don't know Brian, if you would add anything else. Brian Doubles : No, I would just say that the Toys\"R\"Us conversion into a Synchrony Branded MasterCard has really paid off for us. I mean, we're seeing really good activation rates, we're seeing good sales, good spending patterns. And so it's performed very well so far. I mean, it's still early we're testing a number of different things and different strategies on that portfolio, but so far we have been pretty pleased with the performance. Moshe Orenbuch : And the absence of revenue shared, does it help the profitability? Brian Doubles : It certainly helps the profitability. The way that we typically think about that is that gives you more dollars to invest in the value prop. So, for Toys\"R\"Us or us we put that out with a very rich value prop, we tested 2% cash back it's performing really well. You may not need to do that in all cases, but it certainly gives you a bigger economic pool to work with to drive growth going forward. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Just a quick follow-up, the pricing changes that you made on the PayPal Credit portfolio, when do those actually phase into the yield on the loans? Brian Doubles : Yes, you'll start to see that as we move into 2019, now you have to remember the current balances are protected so obviously that only influences go forward sales. So, it will start to bleed in, you probably won't see much in the first half, but it will bleed in throughout 2019. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Greg Ketron : Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and we hope you have a great day. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll begin on slide three. We ended 2018 with a strong fourth quarter which sets the foundation for 2019. We have a number of significant areas to cover today. So I'm going to spend my time covering our business highlights including the renewal and extensions of several key programs, as well as the direction we are going with the Walmart portfolio later this year. Brian will detail our financial results and our outlook for 2019, as well as the potential financial impact of the Walmart portfolio sale later in the call. A very significant and exciting development in the fourth quarter was our renewal with Sam's Club, a top five program for us. By extending our strategic partnership with Sam's Club, we will continue to provide enhanced financing options for Sam's Club members across the retailer's nearly 600 clubs. Sam's Club is a valued and longstanding partner and we are very much looking forward to continuing to deliver innovative products and capabilities and fantastic customer service to help grow membership and sales. Further, we have come to an agreement with Walmart and Capital One on the sale of the Walmart portfolio which will be acquired by Capital One. Brian will provide more details on this later in the call, but I will emphasize that in the coming months we are committed to a seamless transition of the program to Capital One. I'm happy to report that we also renewed several other key partnerships over the last few months. We are very pleased to renew and extend our relationships with Amazon under a long-term agreement building on our 11-year relationship with them. We continue to work with Amazon on enhancing the Amazon store card experience for account holders. We recently launched account management capabilities to a voice command using Alexa, as well as a native app where you can check balances, look up account activity and rewards and manage payments. We look forward to continuing our high level of engagement with Amazon well into the future. We also signed a new co-brand program with eBay, building on a relationship that began in 2004. We are excited about the launch of our new eBay MasterCard, which has attractive value props that reward cardholders with points each time they use their card on and off the eBay website with more points accumulating for purchases made through eBay. We are happy to offer this new program in partnership with one of the world's largest online marketplaces and believe we can help add significant value to eBay and its U.S. customers. We are excited to renew our relationships with Google. Through this partnership, we provide financing for Google store hardware products including Pixel and Google Home products. We look forward to continuing to work with Google and the future prospects of this program. During the quarter, we also extended and expanded our relationship with Qurate Retail Group, one of the largest e-commerce and mobile commerce company in the United States. As part of the expanded partnership, we will provide private label credit card services to HSN starting in August of this year. We are, obviously, very pleased with this program. We also extended our relationship with QVC, which we have since 2005 and also with zulily, a relatively new and successful partnership. Our recent renewals and new program wins further demonstrate our strength in the online retail space, highlighting our e-commerce and digital capabilities. We are also happy to add a new retail card partnership with Harbor Freight, a discount tool and equipment retailer with 900 stores nationwide. In our Payment Solutions business, we renewed a key partnership with Mohawk, a leading global floor manufacturer. We also added a new relationship to our Payment Solutions business. We announced a strategic industry-first credit card partnership with Fanatics, the global leader in license sports merchandise. The long-term partnership will offer fans a new way to pay for merchandise in their account for their favorite team and players with a branded Fanatics credit card. In addition, cardholders will receive special offers to unique sports experiences and will be part of the Fanatics FanCash loyalty program. Together, we will leverage our deep expertise in data analytics to deliver personalized shopping experiences and enhanced loyalty for fans. During the quarter, we also significantly extended our CareCredit network and card utility with Walgreens' recent agreement to accept CareCredit in all 9,000 stores. With the program expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, cardholders will be able to use their CareCredit cards at Walgreens for all of their health and wellness feeds, including prescriptions, deductibles and co-pays. With this new relationship, CareCredit will be accepted at over 17,000 pharmacies nationwide for pharmacy, health, beauty and personal care purchases. Also, in CareCredit, with the recent addition of a new executive partnership with the Medical Group Management Association and our successful peer review by the Health Care Financial Management Association, the CareCredit network has further positioned itself for continued rapid expansion into various new health care specialties in the health system space generally. It was not only a very productive quarter for us, but a very productive year. We accomplished a lot in 2018 including the renewal and extension of five of our largest ongoing programs : PayPal, Lowe's, JCPenney, Amazon and Sam's Club. Across all of our platforms, we renewed more than 50 existing partnerships, but also signing more than 35 new business deals. We also expanded into 11 new CareCredit specialties. And earlier this year we acquired Loop Commerce, a technology leader in digital and in-store gifting services, which brought into our product line and technology capabilities. Overall, it was also a breakout year for technology. Our investments over the past four years are increasingly contributing to our success. Data analytics, AI, the cloud and others are now credit and customer service innovation and new digital and mobile customer experiences. Looking ahead, we continue to have a strong growth trajectory and we will continue to pursue partnerships on economic terms that meet our risk-adjusted return threshold. I will now turn the call over to Brian to detail our financial results and our outlook for 2019. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $783 million or $1.09 per diluted share. Loan receivables were up 14% and interest and fees on loan receivables were up 13% over last year, reflecting the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio in the third quarter. We also continued to deliver solid organic growth. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business as well as the risk-adjusted returns on this growth. The interest and fee income growth were driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 10% over last year and average active account growth was 8%. The positive trends continued in average balances, with growth in average balance per average active account, up 5% compared to last year. RSAs increased $76 million, or 10%, from last year in line with receivable growth. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.8% for the quarter compared to 3.9% last year. The provision for loan losses increased $98 million or 7% from last year, driven by the PayPal Credit reserve build, partially offset by moderating credit trends. The reserve build in the quarter was $204 million, in line with our expectation of $200 million to $250 million. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation. Other income was up $2 million, while interchange was up $14 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $15 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense went back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. We expect loyalty program expenses as a percent of interchange revenue to continue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased to $108 million or 11% versus last year, driven primarily by expenses related to the addition of the PayPal Credit program and business growth. The expense growth rate will continue to be impacted by the addition of the PayPal program until we are comparing against quarters with PayPal on the run rate. We will also continue to make strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline the back office. So overall, the company generated strong performance for the fourth quarter, especially considering the reserve build related to adding the PayPal Credit portfolio. I'll move to slide seven, and cover our net interest income and margin trend. Net interest income was up 11%, driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal portfolio and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.06% compared to last year's margin of 16.24%. The margin was mainly in line with our expectations. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we deployed excess liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition and receivables growth. Also impacting the margin was a decline in the loan receivables yield and an increase in interest bearing liability cost. The loan receivables yield was 21.2%, a decline of 23 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. The increase in total interest bearing liabilities cost was up 52 basis points to 2.48% reflecting higher benchmark rates. We will cover our expectations for the margin going forward in our 2019 outlook later. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.76% compared to 4.67% last year and the 90 plus delinquency rate was 2.29% versus 2.28% last year. The year-over-year trends in both the 30 plus and 90 plus delinquency rates were relatively stable for the third quarter in a row. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 15 basis points and the 90 plus delinquency rate improved by approximately five basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of our underwriting refinements and a more modest impact from normalization. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.54% compared to 5.78% last year and in line with our expectations. While the net charge-off rate benefited from the purchase accounting impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio, the credit trends in the core portfolio also continued to improve. Excluding the PayPal Credit portfolio impact, the net charge-off rate was down by approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.9% and the reserve build from the third quarter was $204 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was in line with our expectations due to the improving credit trends, resulting from the underwriting refinements we made. These underwriting refinements continued to drive changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, excluding the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio, we continued to grow at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score of 7.21 or higher, which increased 7% over the same quarter last year. While purchase volume for accounts with FICO scores of 6.60 and below declined 9%, reflecting some of the modest tightening we've been doing. These trends helped inform our view of loss expectations for this year and beyond. In summary, the core credit trends have leveled off and are showing improvement in line with our expectations and we expect the core trends to continue to show stability as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Later I\u2019ll provide our outlook on credit expectations for the upcoming year. Moving to slide nine, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion, up 11% over last year and were primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program and growth. The efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter versus 30.3% last year and in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of strategic investments. Moving to slide 10, the key highlights are, we have maintained our funding mix and strong capital and liquidity levels while on-boarding the PayPal portfolio. We also made progresses here in deploying capital through growth and by executing the capital plan we announced last May, which increased our dividends and the size of our share repurchases through June of 2019. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity profile. Over the last year we've grown our deposits over $7.5 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, maintaining the level we have been operating at over the last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 14% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rule. This compares to 15.8% on a fully phased-in basis last year, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio and continued execution of our capital plan. During the quarter, we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced last May, by paying a common stock dividend of $0.21 per share. After repurchasing nearly 1 billion of common stock during the third quarter, we did not repurchase stock during the fourth quarter, as we are out of the market pending developments around Walmart and the number of significant renewals we announced. We've approximately 1 billion remaining in potential share repurchases of the 2.2 billion, our Board authorized through the fourth quarters ending June 30, 2019. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plans subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $19 billion, which equated to 18% of our total assets. This is down from 22% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capitals through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Next on slide 11, I'll quickly recap our 2018 performance compared to the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 14% was in line with our outlook range of 13% to 15% including the PayPal Credit portfolio. The growth continued to be driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering solid organic growth. Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs. Moderately tempering some of the growth was the impact from the underwriting refinements we began to implement in the second half of 2016. Net interest margin was 15.97% for the year at the higher end of the 15.75% to 16% range we provided back in January. A more optimal asset and funding mix along with some benefits from a lower than expected deposit rate data were the major drivers of the performance. RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in lower than our outlook last January. RSAs came in at 3.7% versus the original outlook of 4.2% to 4.4%. The lower RSA percent was mainly driven by a modest reduction in yield given improving delinquency trends. The elimination of the RSA payment on Toys\"R\"Us and portfolio mix. This demonstrates the countercyclical nature of the RSAs. Our net charge-off rate of 5.63% was in line with our outlook of 5.5% to 5.8% range for the year. Net charge-offs continue to normalize the degree off the very favorable levels in 2015 and 2016, and as expected, the trends stabilized in the second half of this year. We also saw reserve builds declined from over $1.2 billion in 2017 to near $850 million in 2018, as expected. The efficiency ratio for the year was 30.8% also in line with our expectations. We continued to drive operating leverage to higher margins, revenue growth and increased productivity. And lastly, we generated return on assets of 2.8% versus expectations of around 2.5% due to the factors I just noted. Moving to our 2019 outlook on slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2019 assume the FET continues to tighten this year and the unemployment rate is mainly stable. We are providing the 2019 outlook including the impact of the Walmart portfolio sale expected to occur later in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter this year. I will also provide some details around other impacts the portfolio sale will have on the reserve and capital deployment. Our outlook for core receivables growth, excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio sale, is in the 5% to 7% range. The growth rate takes into account strong growth we are seeing from e-commerce and digital and that the impact from the underwriting refinements is now reflected in the ongoing run rate. This also assumes economic trends continue. We expect to grow sales volume at 2 to 3 times broader retail sales and for e-commerce and digital to continue its strong growth. We believe our margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range this year with the normal seasonality we see quarter-to-quarter. While the 2019 margin, when compared to 2018, will benefit from the PayPal pre-funding impact not repeating in higher benchmark rates, this will be largely offset by a slightly lower revolve rate, as well as excess liquidity for a short period of time due to the Walmart portfolio sale. We expect that RSAs as a percentage of average receivables will trend closer to the 4% to 4.2% range for 2019. The single largest driver of the expected increase in the RSA outlook is the sale of the Walmart portfolio which operates at a lower RSA percentage than our overall rate. The outlook is more in line with our historical run rate and, aside from the Walmart portfolio sale impact, reflects continued strong performance of our programs. The good news here is that we're able to renew and extend five of our largest ongoing programs, beginning with PayPal, Lowe's, JCPenney, Amazon and Sam's Club while maintaining the RSA as a percent of average receivables in line with the historical average for the company and at attractive risk-adjusted returns. In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with a slight increase entirely driven by the impacts from the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the Walmart portfolio. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the net charge-off rate is expected to be flat to 2018. Looking at seasonality in net charge-offs, we typically see the NCO rate trend higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the seasonal decline in receivables. While the increase has historically been in the 40 to 70 basis point range, we expect it may trend towards the higher end of this range given the decline purchase accounting benefit from the PayPal Credit portfolio. Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will continue to transition to more growth-driven builds and less from normalization. We will also see some impact due to the remaining reserve build on the PayPal Credit program. Our expectation is that reserve builds for the first quarter of 2019 will be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter around $200 million. This would exclude any reserve impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio which I will get to shortly. Moving to the efficiency ratio for 2019. We expect to continue to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 31% similar to 2018. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will partly offset by continued spend on strategic investments we feel are important to the business. Regarding Walmart's impact on the efficiency ratio, we are executing cost actions that will offset the revenue impact from the portfolio of being sold. Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry, and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. Finally, consistent with our track record, we expect to generate a return on assets of 2.5% or greater in 2019. Before I conclude, I wanted to provide some additional information on the impacts from the Walmart portfolio of sale. Given we now have an agreement to sell the portfolio it will be moved to loans held for sale in the first quarter. Our future expected losses in the portfolio will be limited to the remaining time we have it and in the first quarter we will be releasing reserves in the range of approximately $500 million based on the expected sale date. This begins to free up part of the capital related to the Walmart portfolio that we communicated earlier. Beyond the first quarter, additional capital will be freed up from future reserve releases on the portfolio and ultimately the sale of the portfolio later this year. We expect the size of the portfolio will be approximately $9 billion at the time of the sale. The capital freed up will be deployed through share repurchases and/or higher returning alternatives. Overall, we continue to believe the combination of capital deployment and cost savings will result in the replacement of the EPS the program was generating. And with that I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a recap of our strategic priorities, the continued focus of our assets to drive value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders. A top priority remains to execute successfully across our three platforms, building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and digital and mobile technology. We still have a lot of room to grow organically and we will focus on driving that organic growth, but also evaluating potential new programs with appropriate risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to make investments to expand the utility of our cards and innovate with our partners to create attractive value proposition and drive card usage. We will continue to invest in next-generation data analytics and technology offering. Digital and mobile technologies remained a key focus as these channels become increasingly popular. We will further develop frictionless customer experiences in a digitized environment through the use of customer journey and size. We are also focused on leveraging alternative data and machine learning to further drive innovation, advanced underwriting and authentication. Our banking platform remains an important funding source. And as such, we will continue to broaden our products and capabilities to help increase loyalty, diversify funding and drive profitability. We will also continue to explore opportunities to expand and diversify the business in areas like health care finance, small business and proprietary networks. It remains a key priority to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We have proven our ability to do this and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operation, business growth, credit rating and regulatory targets. Finally, we will continue to utilize our strong capital position to support growth, which are in capital through dividends and share purchases and M&A and continued investments that support our business objectives and capabilities. We believe we are well-positioned for long-term growth and we look forward to driving results for our partner\u2019s, cardholders and shareholders in 2019. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks and congratulations on a whole bunch of things that you announced. Maybe Margaret, you could just summarize, because I think there's been some debate over the last few months about the level of expertise from an e-commerce standpoint. And I've been impressed actually with the partners that you've renewed and the partners that you've added. And can you just talk about the contribution that that makes to your growth rate? And what it means for additional partnerships that you've been able to add? Margaret Keane : Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Moshe. I think that all of you know that we've been working really hard to continue to enhance our digital capabilities, and we've been focusing both on the digital side as well as analytics. And I think if you see some of the names and partners that we've been also with or win over the last 12 months, you can see we're certainly winning in the digital space whether it\u2019s Amazon, PayPal, eBay, LazMall, zulily. We're winning in the space and I think if we look at our overall performance, our year-over-year mobile growth totaled 39% and 52% with PayPal in the fourth quarter. U.S. growth is about 16%. Our online sales for retail card penetration was 35%. And our apps, actual apps occurring digitally are up 45%, 49% with PayPal in the fourth quarter. And the last piece, I'd add is, we've talked about SyPi is -- which is really the whole plug-in that we do with our partners where you don't really meet their site through actually ending partners application. We have that out there with 21 brands and partners right now. We just hit over 1 billion in credit card payments in that application. So our view is we have a soup to nuts capabilities from applying and buying to a digital card, to getting your loyalty rewards, to then servicing your account within the apps. So our perspective is we certainly have the capability and continue to enhance that capability. Probably the biggest enhancement now is taking all that digital capability and enhancing it with data and customer journeys as we continue to make each experience frictionless. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Thanks. And a follow-up question, Brian, you talked about having $1 billion remaining and then the $500 million that is now available as of the reserve release. Could you talk a little bit about perhaps the cadence of how you would deploy that and whether it's buyback or other alternatives? Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure, Moshe. So, look now that we have clarity around the portfolio being sold, we'll start to free up the capital that's allocated to portfolio. As we said earlier, we still believe the transaction allows us to offset the EPS impact to Walmart. It's accretive relative to our renewal. And so I think in terms of timing, if I just take you through the year, we indicated that in the first quarter we\u2019ll move the portfolio that held for sale will only retain reserves for the period that we\u2019re holding the assets. So you'll see a fairly significant reserve release in the first quarter. That should be around $500 million. And then you'll see subsequent reserve releases in the second quarter and third quarter, somewhere in the range of $200 million to $250 million in each quarter. And so that steps you through the reserve releases and what to expect there. And then, obviously, we expect to sell the assets late third quarter, early fourth quarter. And that's when we'll free up the additional capital that's allocated to the portfolio. So that gives you a sense of the cadence on the capital release in terms of the timing on deployments. We\u2019re, obviously, in discussions with the regulators on our board on how to go about that and timing and when we have more to share there. We'll, obviously, share it with all of you. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks very much. Real quick I guess clarification, Brian. You mentioned a $200 million reserve build in Q1, but then separate from that, you've got a release from Walmart. Are we -- the distinguished -- the Walmart portfolio at this point given that its going -- it won't held for sale from call it the core portfolio? Or how do we think about that basis there? Brian Doubles : Yeah. I would take it in those two pieces, John. So I would take in the first quarter, we expect the reserve build for the core portfolio plus the remaining build related to PayPal. We're still working our way through that. We think that is a $200 million approximate build in the first quarter. And then you'll see approximately $500 million release in the first quarter related to Walmart. So you have those net $300 million release in the first quarter. John Hecht : Okay, thanks. And then, you guys have really worked through a lot of the partnerships extended brought out new partnerships. Margaret, I'm wondering, can you tell us has there been any changes in the structural components of the contracts? Or is it largely like it's been the last several years? Margaret Keane : It's largely the same. I think, if you look at the overall plan for 2019, you could see the RSA's and our overall return for the business returns remains the same. So, we're just really pleased about how the quarter ended and how we actually successfully want to renew throughout 2018. We had 50 renewals overall -- for the overall business and we're really confident. I think one of the things that we've continually said is we're going to renew deals that work for us and that are important to us. And that we have high-level engagement from our partners where we feel we can really grow. And I think everyone that we've been able to renew and win our partners that fit that description. John Hecht : Wonderful. Thanks very much guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on all these developments. I guess first question is with all these extensions and renewals, should we assume that any appreciable concentration has been pushed out five years now? Brian Doubles : Sanjay, you're talking about the terms of the agreements? Sanjay Sakhrani : Yeah. I'm just saying like as far as like any significant renewal you might have going forward in terms of the concentration? Is it fair to assume now we're four, five years away from anything significant? Brian Doubles : Well, look, I think when you assume, obviously, these are all confidential agreements, but in each case for the large renewals, these are multi-year agreements, multiyear extensions from the last contractual date. And I think that gives you some indication that in all cases this gives us fairly significant amount of time to get in there, drive growth, drive penetration with these partners. So very good extensions in all cases, really attractive financial profile, good returns. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. And then I guess a follow-up question for Margaret. I'm curious what you think led to a different outcome on Sam's Club versus Walmart? I know the product and the value props were different, but I mean did they feel just differently about the value you provided versus Walmart? Maybe you could just talk about that a little bit? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Yeah. I think part of it is really the importance of the credit card program. I think to the Sam's Club, it's a little different than the percentage penetration we had in Walmart. So I think from a member perspective, the card's a big part of Sam's Club sales. So I think that's an important element. I think the other is, and I've said this all along, it's really two separate teams. We have always had a decent relationship with Sam's Club. And I think we leveraged our capabilities and the things we're building to win that relationship. I think one of the things we've talked about throughout this process is how -- this isn't always easy, how important it is for us to continue to deliver for both Walmart and Sam's throughout this transition? And I think as we went through the holiday, we made sure we delivered great customer service to both parties and I think that's how you win in the space. It's really about how you deliver for the partner. And I think we've been able to come out of this in a really good way and we are looking really forward to really continuing our partnership with Sam and helping them grow their sales and extend their membership. I mean, that's what's really important here. Sanjay Sakhrani : Right. Congrats again. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : And we have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : So Brian, just to clarify the Walmart portfolio, was there a gain or sale or was it more sort of at par? And then, I guess, essentially what you're saying is, you're sort of reiterating this $2.5 billion of freed up capital, maybe adjusted a little bit by the portfolio size, but essentially no change there. You walk through the reserve, if you could kind of comment on that. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So, look, in terms of the first question, I can't be too specific on the terms, but I will highlight that our ability to replace the EPS didn't hinge on getting a gain on the portfolio. So the capital released from our perspective was really coming from the reserves and the capital that\u2019s allocated to the portfolio. So now that we have clarity on the portfolio sale and the timing, we still believe the transaction allows us to offset the EPS. Other than that, I can't be too specific. And I gave you -- in terms of the capital, I gave you pretty clear walk on the reserves. The portfolio is approximately $9 billion at the time of sale. When we made our first announcement, it was closer to $10 billion. So we do expect a little bit of attrition between now and then, just given some scaling because of marketing funds and things like that between now and close. But I think that\u2019s real. Don Fandetti : The other clarification, I thought last quarter you had mentioned that you thought the loan yield might be down potentially 50 to 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but it looks like it was up. Can you talk about that? Brian Doubles : The loan yield, just in general? Don Fandetti : Yes. I mean, I thought it was going to be down a little bit more. I could have that wrong, but it seems like it came in a little bit better. Brian Doubles : Yes. So what we said that, net interest margin in total would be kind of in that 16% range for the second half of the year and it came in right in line with that. If you look at just the receivable yield, that was down 23 basis points compared to the prior year. And that was entirely driven by the PayPal portfolio. So if you exclude the effects of PayPal, the core yield would have been up approximately 10 bps compared to the prior year, so pretty consistent. Don Fandetti : Okay. Brian Doubles : I think, any other noise quarter-to-quarter is probably just normal seasonality, Don. Don Fandetti : Okay, got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Brian, you'd made the comment that long term the expectation is that the deposits will grow in line with receivables growth. I'm curious what the funding mix is going to look like this year. Will you pay down some debt, or will we actually just see a build in the investment securities until the proceeds are redeployed? Brian Doubles : Yes, Rick. Look I think in terms of our funding plans for 2018, I would expect them to be largely consistent with where we\u2019ve trended over the last couple of years. Our target ranges are for deposits to be 70% to 75% of the funding, secure to be 15% to 20%, unsecured to be 10% to 15%. I don't see anything as I think about 2019 that really changes that profile in a material way. Now, obviously, we're opportunistic in terms of when to go a little bit heavier on one of those funding sources than others. But, overall, I think that's the target range that we're pretty comfortable with. And you'll see that for most of 2019. The only other thing I would highlight is we're going to be very careful around how we manage liquidity in advance of the Walmart portfolio sales. So we will have to carry some excess liquidity after that sale happens, but we'll look to minimize that as best as we can and we\u2019ll do that through all three of those funding sources. Rick Shane : Got it. And again, look obviously, the deposit funding is very important part of the long-term strategy and I guess, I'm curious, how easy if you turn on and off as you sort of approach this event call lead to Q3 and then ramp it up going forward? Brian Doubles : Yes. It's actually fairly easy. And look that's good and bad. I mean, we're steel fairly rate sensitive in the deposit book. And so if we lack the market significantly for a period of time then we'll be able to manage the deposit inflow and the maturities in a way that helps us minimize the excess liquidity that we carry after the Walmart portfolio transitions. So I think it's pretty manageable. You can negate it entirely, but it's certainly something we'll be focused on and it's pretty manageable from our perspective. Rick Shane : Great. Really appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I wondered if you could give us some color as to how the PayPal portfolio is going relative to expectations and as well as a give some color around, how you're thinking about the reserving for that? I know you gave us 1Q, but may be can you give us a sense as to the forward look for the full year coming from them? Margaret Keane : Sure. I'll start out. First, our partnership is really just fantastic. We have such a high level of engagement between us and PayPal. I think maybe some of you saw the announcements as we are working with PayPal to help deferred load in employees of the federal government, we did that in like 24 hours. And to get that kind of level of engagement in terms of how to service their customers and how to grow the program is just fantastic. So we're fully, fully aligned. The program is operating the way we thought it would. And I think we're just really excited about the overall growth potential as we continue to look at areas of opportunity together for growth. Obviously, we have work to do you to kind of bring the full portfolio on, but we're very focused on delivering for that. And we're just overall really pleased with our partnership and I couldn't be happy about how the program is performing. Brian, on the reserves. Brian Doubles : Yeah. So, Betsy, on the reserves, we ended the quarter with a $204 million build. We think the first quarter looks very similar in terms of the range and that includes both the reserve build for PayPal as well as the core reserve build. So, we're not going to break out PayPal anymore going forward, but what we'll do is step that out for you as we get through the year, kind of, one quarter at a time. So, we think the PayPal reserve build based on the purchase accounting, that's largely complete by the end of the second quarter, maybe a little bit addressed in the third quarter. But we think $200 million range for the first quarter then in April; we\u2019ll give you a sense for what we think in the second quarter. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then on the buybacks, is there any opportunity for you to accelerate that with the Walmart sale, I think the back book sale that you're doing, is there any kind of forward purchase that you can do? I'm just trying to think through, if that's feasible for you? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Look, it's harder for us to be too specific in terms of timing versus relatively fresh agreement. We now have certainty around timing and other things and we\u2019re in conversions with our board and our regulators about how and when we can deploy that capital. So, I can't be much more specific than that other than, our goal is to deploy it as it\u2019s being freed up, assuming that more in line with all of our capital targets and the board and the regulators are comfortable. So, when we have more to announce, we'll certainly announce it. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yeah, thanks. Could you discuss a little more about where we should expect some of the expenses to come out as you manage to a relatively flat efficiency ratio with the Walmart revenues going away? Brian Doubles : Yes. So, look, first I'd say that we have very detailed plans that we're going to begin executing and have already started to execute this year to get that done. Some of the cost actions will actually happen in advance of the program moving. So, there are some costs that are not directly tied to the program. But I would think about Mark, the majority of the cost actions will be completed as soon as possible after the portfolio is sold. And one of the things that we're, obviously, very focused on as Margaret said is not affecting the performance of the program, making sure we ensure a seamless transition on our part. And so a lot of those cause remain in place until the portfolio transfers. But we do feel like we've got a really good plan in place to offset any impact on the efficiency ratio. We don't expect there to be any impact on our operating leverage. But you'll really see the full benefits of those cost actions in 2020. That will be our first year without the program. Mark DeVries : Got it. And then on the Amazon renewal, were you able to make any changes to the agreement there that may improve your position in relative to chase like better geography on the website for advertising or acceptance that hold through? Margaret Keane : Yeah, look, Mark what I would say there is we can't provide any specifics on any of our individual agreements. But as we've said in the past, whenever you do these renewals, you typically move around the economics, you look for ways to drive further alignment between us and the partner, you find ways to drive more growth. And in the case of all of our renewals, we've been able to achieve an attractive financial profile. I think in all cases, we have better alignment with the partner under to go-forward agreement and so we feel really good about what we did with Amazon, but in the case of all the renewals. Mark DeVries : Okay, thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Understand that you're not going to provide specific sort of confidential terms on the Sam\u2019s renewable. I was wondering if you could maybe just kind of give us directionally an idea, was it more of just a push out of the existing contract, or was it really back to the table open book negotiation with a longer potential duration to the renewal? Margaret Keane : Well, you know, look, in all these cases, these are good negotiations. So we had a good negotiation with our friends at Sam's. We feel really good about the outcome. And I think, as Brian said, this is a multiyear agreement, an extension from when that program was supposed to end. So, for us, I think -- look I think the most positive thing is we've been able to renew Sam's, resolve where the Walmart book is going. And not have the loss sitting over our head. So the overall results of where we ended is, really great for the company. We're very confident that we'll continue to serve Sam's Club really well and help them grow which is what we do. And I think we did all this in the fourth quarter and we delivered in the fourth quarter for our partners. So we feel good and we're very happy about where we landed with the agreement with Walmart and Sam's Club. Matthew O'Neill: Thanks. And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that. From a higher level, obviously, a huge numbers of renewables on a lot of large partners and impressive outcome with respect to the 2019 guidance maintaining the 2.5 ROA, just curious, in these discussions was it in part motivated by serve an adjustment to the terms as far as on ROA and the share growth with respect to the tax reform? Or were there any other kind of consistent changes throughout the renewables, or was it really just kind of the duration was up. It was time to come back to the table and generally speaking not material changes and similar ROA outlook? Brian Doubles : Yeah, look, I would say that every one of these is very unique. In some cases, you are moving around some terms, in some cases you're moving around the value prop or the marketing funds to benefit the consumer and drive growth, in some cases, you're tweaking the RSA or the marketing funds. I mean there's just so many different things inside of these agreements so you can move based on what the partner wants and what we want to achieve. I'd say in all cases where we have moved around economics, we do it in a way historically that has benefited the consumer frankly and has \u2013 we\u2019ve put dollars to work to drive growth. As Margaret said in all cases, these renewals have a very attractive financial profile. We gave you our 2019 outlook that includes the impact of all the renewals and you can see as you mentioned the RSA percentage and ROA percentage are right in line with the historical run rate. So you always move some things around in these to get both parties happy. But in all cases, we're able to get this done with a pretty attractive financial profile for us. Matthew O'Neill: Got it. Thanks very much, guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Margaret Keane : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Jamie Friedman : Margaret, in your prepared remarks, you had called out something about Google. But I didn't see it on page three. I was just wondering if you could just revisit what you said there, it sounded important? Margaret Keane : Yes. We renewed our partnership with Google. We actually financed their hardware, so Pixel and items that they sell on their website. So that was an extension we did as well in our fourth quarter. So that's kind of what I said in the prepared remarks. Jamie Friedman : Okay. And then also in your answer to the first question, you gave some of those technology related metrics that you frequently share. I was wondering if you could repeat those, you were going kind of quick there? Margaret Keane : Yes, sure. So our year-over-year mobile growth totaled 39%, 52% with PayPal in the fourth quarter. So we continue to see really good traction. I think two things. One is, the additional capabilities we continue to build as we try to make that whole mobile experience wing to wing friction less. But I think the other is, consumers more and more are on their tablets or on their phones in terms of how they're shopping. So that was I think a big move for us. Our online sales, actually sales on our cards online for retail card was 35%. So that continues to grow as well in the fourth quarter. And then, in terms of acquiring new accounts, applications, we're now up to 45% of our apps occurring digitally. If you add PayPal in there in the fourth quarter, it was 49%. And then lastly, we integrated SyPi into 21 of our partners and brands. And that particular SyPi capability allows you to really service your card seamlessly with any app of the retailers, so you never have to leave. And we hit a $1 billion in card payments last year. So we're continuing to see very good traction in terms of the capabilities that we're building out. We worked very closely with our partners as they are looking at their digital roadmap. And we're trying to align with them and deliver every quarter on the needs for those particular partners. So again, really excited about what we've been able to build. And there's a lot -- still lots of opportunity to grow on the digital roadmap, and partnerships with our customers. Jamie Friedman : Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler with the Buckingham. Chris Brendler : Hi. Thanks, and congratulations as well. I had a question on PayPal acquisition. And sort of how it's trending, it's kind of hard to see exactly what's going on. But Brain, I think you called out some NIM or yield pressure related to PayPal. And also, just if you can give us a sense of the growth profile on the ROA at this point. It doesn\u2019t quite seem like with delinquencies building and the yield coming down a little bit, I'm not sure how to think about the return profile of the PayPal transaction at this point. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So look, we -- I guess, what I would say is, the portfolio or the program is trending exactly in line with our expectations. We knew that there would be a little bit of noise in some of the metrics in 2018. As we indicated, you go to work through that reserve build, the upfront reserve build on the portfolio. We still expect the program to be accretive in 2019, no change to what we said earlier. The impact on yield is really just driven by the fact that the PayPal portfolio itself runs at a lower yield on our overall book. We did make some pricing changes that will start to bleed in over the course of 2019 into 2020. That will offset some of that, but you're really just saying the fact that the PayPal portfolio, given where it's priced, runs at a lower yield than the overall portfolio. And so that drove some of what you're seeing on net interest margin and yield in the quarter. And then, what you're seeing on some of the credit metrics is just the working through the rest of the purchase accounting. So that's largely done this quarter. As we've indicated in the past, the PayPal portfolio will put some upward bias on the net charge-off rate into 2019. We highlighted that as part of our outlook. So if you think about net charge-offs in that 5.7% to 5.9% range that includes PayPal, it includes the partial offset for Walmart. And if you exclude both of those impacts, the core net charge-off rate is flat. So, we try to get you a pretty good indication of where PayPal is influencing those metrics, but I would say generally the program, the portfolio is trending right in line with our expectations. Chris Brendler : That's helpful. Thanks. And a separate question. You mentioned, Toys\"R\"Us having, I think a benefit on retailers sharing this quarter. And just sort of studying back since that bankruptcy occurred in 2018, we potentially could have more retail bankruptcies in your portfolio in the future. Is that a glitch from an earnings-neutral event to think in this case Toys\"R\"Us, like is this test case suggests that we shouldn't worry too much about retailers too much along the future? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Look our goal is to always try and keep it earnings neutral. Toys\"R\"Us a good example, gives you an indication of the options that we have, when that happens to one of our partners. So in that case, we took those account holders. We converted into a Synchrony branded general-purpose card. We stopped paying the RSA, as we indicated and we use those additional dollars to fund a very attractive value prop. So that's certainly our goal. And we do have options to help mitigate the impact in those cases. Chris Brendler : Great. Thanks so much. Greg Ketron : With that, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I had a couple of quick ones. First, on your loan growth guidance, what was the balance of the Walmart loans at the end of 2018? I want to make sure that we're looking at the correct point or period and 2018 base for the guide? Brian Doubles : Yeah. I mean, Bill, I can't give it to you specifically. But we indicated it was 10 billion, expected to be 9 billion when we close, so it's somewhere in between. That's probably as close as I can get you. Bill Carcache : Okay. And then last just question on tail risk under the agreement. Can you give us a sense of whether we should expect any impact? I understand that the terms of the agreement are tough financial, but should we expect or what kind of impact if any, should we expect -- the impact of the Walmart portfolio to have on your results post sales, if any? Brian Doubles : It will have no impact on our results post sales. This is a complete transfer of the portfolio. We are retaining no risk. There is no ongoing sharing. There is no law support. There is nothing. This is a very standard clean transaction. So, when it closes, it's closed. Bill Carcache : Okay. So it's reasonable then to conclude that essentially the three parties for the transactions; yourself, Capital One and Walmart, Capital One's indication last night that its losses are limited, which suggest then that Walmart is playing a role in absorbing losses beyond a certain amount, but not to you guys. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Look, I can't comment on the agreement between the other two parties. What I can tell you is that our side of this is pretty clean from that perspective, very standard transfer of the portfolio, very market. We're not retaining any risk. Bill Carcache : Understood. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Greg Ketron : Thanks operator. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call.

Margaret Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Doubles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 3. The momentum we generated over the last several quarters continued in the first quarter of 2019. We maintained our strong performance across several key areas of the business, which helped drive earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.56 per share. Included in our results is the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio being moved to loans held-for-sale, which positively impacted results by $0.56. Brian will discuss this in more detail later in the call. Loan receivables grew 3%. On a core basis, which excludes the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables grew 17%. We generated solid net interest income and purchase volume growth of 10% and average active accounts were up 8%. We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and added some exciting new partnerships. In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we recently extended our exclusive consumer financing program with P.C. Richard & Son, a leading family-owned and operated appliance and electronics company. P.C. Richard & Son is a valued partner and this extension will build on our long-term partnership in which we have provided credit card and promotional financing options for their customers. The partnership will continue to leverage our marketing analytics and mobile technologies to further enhance the customer experience. We are partnering on marketing and loyalty programs and a branded mobile app for purchasing and payments, in which customers can shop, receive special offers and promotions and service their credit card. We are excited to continue to build on this long and successful partnership. We also announced a multi-year extension with Rheem to continue providing a financing program for the purchase of HVAC and water heating products and services. Rheem offers a wide range of residential and commercial products including air conditioners, furnaces, water heaters and more. We have been providing financing options for Rheem customers for 15 years and look forward to continuing to deliver value to Rheem and their customers. Additionally, in our Payment Solutions platform, we recently signed a multi-year extension of our Suzuki installment powersports and marine program. Qualifying buyers will continue to have access to special financing options and exclusive offers for Suzuki products through its dealer network in the United States. Powersports is an important category for us and Suzuki is one of our longest running programs in this category, so we are pleased to announce this extension. One of our strategic priorities is to grow our network to create broader acceptance and utility for our cards. To that end, we recently announced that we expanded acceptance categories for our Synchrony Car Care network to cover even more auto-related needs. Cardholders now have the ability to use this comprehensive Car Care solution at more than 500,000 locations across 25 categories, including gas, auto parts and service, car washes, parking, ridesharing and more. The card also now offers six-month promotional financing on purchases greater than $199. Synchrony Car Care is a valuable financial resource for consumers that want to manage their auto spending needs with one convenient payment method. In addition, our Synchrony HOME credit card is now accepted at over one million locations nationwide. The card offers valuable rewards including 2% cash back on purchases under $299. And for purchases up $299 or more, cardholders can now receive six months promotional financing. This is in addition to 12 months to 60 months of promotional financing on qualifying purchases at thousands of participating locations. We are pleased to expand the value propositions on this card, giving cardholders the flexibility they want for larger ticket home purchases. We are also expanding our CareCredit network via a new partnership with Simplee. Through this new partnership, CareCredit will now be part of the Simplee financial experience platform, a digital self-service experience that incorporates advanced data analytics and machine learning to provide patients personalized estimates and payment options. We are happy to be part of the innovative Simplee network. Another strategic priority for us is to expand and diversify our business. An example of this is extending product offerings through the entry into adjacent and complementary businesses. Our recent acquisition of Pets Best represents our entry into the pet insurance business as a managing general agent. This acquisition will allow us to offer a comprehensive suite of payment options for veterinarians and pet owners to help families get the care they need for their pet. This complementary acquisition builds on our decades of expertise in the veterinary market. We are excited about adding the Pets Best products to our offerings. This is a type of acquisition we seek, one that makes sense for our customers and partners and enables us to expand our network and product offerings. As you know adding utility ultimately translates to increased usage and we have made considerable progress on that front. For example, for CareCredit, the reuse rate in the first quarter was 54%. Equally important as utilization is ease of use of our cards. Concurrent with the rise of e-commerce and digital shopping experiences, we have been making investments to ensure our cardholders have access to their cards rewards and account information across whatever channel they choose to use. The digital sales penetration for our Retail Card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 37% in the first quarter. Overall, 48% of our application are happening online, with the mobile channel alone growing 37% over the same quarter of last year. Overall, this was a strong quarter for us. We continue to generate organic growth, renewing partner relationships, develop valuable strategic partnerships and invest in innovative digital technology and seamless customer experiences. These areas of focus are helping to drive our performance and remain critical for our future success. I'll spend a few moments on our sales platform results on slide five and then turn it over to Brian to detail our financial results for the quarter. In Retail Card, strong results were driven by our PayPal Credit program acquisition, which was largely offset by the reclassification of the Walmart portfolio. Loans were up 1%, but excluding the Walmart portfolio, they were up 22%. Interest and fees on loans increased 15% over last year and purchase volume grew 11%. Average active accounts were up 10%.  Payment Solutions also delivered another solid quarter. We generated broad-based growth across the sales platform, with particular strength in home furnishings and luxury products that resulted in loan receivable growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased 7%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 4% and average active accounts increased 3%. CareCredit also continued to generate solid growth. Receivables growth of 7% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans also increased 6%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 8% and average active accounts increased 4%. We continued to deliver solid growth across all three of our sales platforms, as we continue to extend relationships, increase card utility and provide value add solutions to our partners and cardholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning we reported first quarter earnings of $1.1 billion or $1.56 per diluted share. This included the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio being moved to loans held-for-sale during the quarter. The release totaled $522 million or $395 million after tax and provide an EPS benefit of $0.56 to the quarter. We generated strong year-over-year growth in a number of areas. Excluding the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables were up 17%. Interest and fees on loan receivables were up 12% over last year, reflecting the addition of the PayPal Credit program last year. We also continued to deliver solid organic growth. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk-adjusted returns on this growth. Purchase volume growth was 10% and average active accounts increased 8% over last year. The positive trends continued in average balances, with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year. RSAs increased $234 million or 33% from last year. Lower core reserve build growth, as well as improved program performance drove the increase. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.3% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. We continue to expect RSAs as a percentage of average receivables to be in the 4.0% to 4.2% range for 2019, which I will cover in more detail later. The provision for loan losses decreased $503 million or 37% from last year, mainly driven by the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation. Other expenses increased $55 million or 6% versus last year, driven primarily by expenses related to the addition of the PayPal Credit program and business growth. The growth rate did slow compared to prior quarters, and we have begun to execute certain cost actions ahead of the Walmart program conveyance later this year. The expense growth rate will continue to be impacted by the addition of the PayPal Credit program, until we are comparing against quarters with PayPal in the run rate, beginning with the third quarter of this year. We will also continue to make strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities, and investments to automate and streamline the back office. So overall the company continued to generate strong results in the first quarter. I'll move to slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10% driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal Credit program and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.08% compared to last year's margin of 16.05%. The margin was mainly in line with our expectations. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we deployed excess liquidity to support the PayPal Credit program acquisition and receivables growth. Also impacting the margin was a decline in loan receivables yield and an increase in interest-bearing liability costs. The loan receivables yield was 21.14%, a decline of 25 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the impact of adding the PayPal Credit program. The increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost was 54 basis points to 2.64% reflecting the higher benchmark rates. So overall, the margin was in line with our expectations. We believe our margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year with normal seasonality including a slight decline in the second quarter as well as some potential fluctuation around the Walmart portfolio sale later this year. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.92% compared to 4.52% last year, and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.51% versus 2.28% last year. The increase in the delinquency rates was primarily due to the reclassification of approximately $8 billion in Walmart loan receivables to held for sale. Only the Walmart loan receivables that we expect to charge-off prior to the expected portfolio of sale remain in period-end loan receivables, which is nearly $700 million. Given that we continue to report the delinquencies on the nearly $700 million in period-end loan receivables and a high percentage of these receivables are delinquent and represent the majority of the delinquent accounts in the Walmart portfolio in total. The exclusion of the $8 billion in held for sale from period-end loan receivables skewed the reported rates higher. Also impacting the delinquency rates is the addition of the PayPal Credit program. If you exclude the impact of the Walmart portfolio and the PayPal Credit program the 30-plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 10 basis points and the 90-plus delinquency rate improved by approximately five basis points, reflecting the impact of our underwriting refinements that have resulted in stable to improving credit trends. Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 6.06% compared to 6.14% last year. While credit trends continued to improve, this was partially offset by the impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the PayPal Credit program and the Walmart portfolio impact the net charge-off rate was down by approximately 30 basis points compared to last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.39% and the core reserve build from the fourth quarter excluding the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio was $37 million. As I noted earlier, the core reserve build was lower than our expectations, due to the improving credit trends resulting from the underwriting refinements we made. Looking forward, we expect the core reserve build for the second quarter will be largely driven by growth and will be in the $100 million to $150 million range. We still expect the additional reductions in reserves related to the Walmart portfolio will average in the $200 million to $250 million range in the second and third quarters. We still anticipate the sale to occur in the late third or early fourth quarter of this year. We also expect net charge-offs to be 20 to 30 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to the timing of recoveries and as we begin to see the full impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. The recovery rate as a percentage of average receivables was 1.27% in the first quarter and we have been running closer to 1% in prior quarters. Regarding the PayPal Credit program, we are now largely through most of the credit-related purchase accounting benefit that resulted from acquiring the portfolio last year. This is in line with our expectations and included in our 2019 net charge-off outlook. We continue to expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase year-over-year entirely driven by the impact from the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the Walmart portfolio later this year. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart the net charge-off rate is expected to be flat to 2018. In summary, credit trends have leveled-off and are showing improvement in line with our expectations and we expect the trends to continue to show stability as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $1 billion, up 6% over last year, and were primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program and growth. As I noted earlier, the growth rate did slow compared to prior periods, and we have begun to execute on certain cost actions ahead of the Walmart program conveyance later this year and we will continue to execute on this as the year progresses. The efficiency ratio was 31% for the quarter, the same level as last year and in line with our expectations. Moving to slide 10. The key highlights are, we have maintained our funding mix and strong capital and liquidity levels while deploying capital through growth and on-boarding the PayPal Credit program. We also made progress this year on deploying capital through the execution of the capital plan we announced last May, which increased our dividends and the size of our share repurchases. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity profile. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits $7.5 billion or 13%, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 75% of our funding compared to 73% last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. In March, we issued $1.25 billion in senior unsecured notes, with $600 million having a five-year maturity and $650 million having a 10-year maturity. The issuances had strong demand and were significantly oversubscribed. Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.8% on a fully phased-in basis last year, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio growth and continued execution of our capital plan. During the quarter, we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced last May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.21 per share and repurchased 966 million of common stock during the first quarter. This represented 30.9 million shares repurchased during the quarter and completes the 2.2 billion share repurchase program our board approved last May. Regarding our 2019 capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors and we submitted the plan to our regulators in late March. This is similar to the timeline in previous years. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, it does include capital deployment from the anticipated capital freed up from the reserve releases and sale of the Walmart portfolio, as well as our regular ongoing capital plan that would include continued deployment of capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.4 billion, which equated to 22.2% of our total assets. This is down from nearly 26% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal credit program acquisition. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude I wanted to recap our current view for the second quarter and the year. Overall, the margin performed in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We believe our margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year with the normal seasonality, including a slight decline in the second quarter, as well as some potential fluctuation around the Walmart portfolio sale later this year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.3% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Lower core reserve build growth, as well as improved program performance were drivers in the quarter. As we expect the reserve builds to align more with growth in future quarters, this will have a moderating impact on the RSA percentage. We continue to expect the RSA percentage to be in the 4% to 4.2% range for 2019. Regarding credit. We expect the core reserve build for the second quarter will be largely driven by growth and will be in the $100 million to $150 million range. We still expect the additional reductions in reserves related to the Walmart portfolio will average in the $200 million to $250 million range in the second and third quarters. We still anticipate the sale to occur in the late third or early fourth quarter of this year. We also expect net charge-offs to be 20 to 30 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, due to the timing of recoveries and as we began to see the full impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. This is in line with our expectations and included in our 2019 net charge-off outlook. We continue to expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with a slight increase compared to 2018, entirely driven by the impact from the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the Walmart portfolio later this year. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the NCO rate is expected to be flat to 2018. Turning to expenses. We continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns. With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap-up and then will open the call for Q&A. We generated strong results this quarter as our focus on organic growth, program renewals, strategic partnerships, forward-thinking technology investments and actionable data analytics continue to be key factors in our success. We are pleased with the significant number of renewals and extensions we have generated over the last several quarters. We are making investments that create value for our partners and a better more seamless experience for our cardholders. And we're maintaining our focus on delivering value for our shareholders. To that end, we returned $1.1 billion in capital through 966 million of share repurchases and a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend. Additionally, we remain focused on deploying capital through continued organic growth and program acquisitions. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to just drill down on the RSA trend a little bit, which is a little bit higher than our expectations. And obviously Brian, you guys kept the guidance range unchanged. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of the sequencing of that RSA because it's been a little uneven in the past. And just to be clear, the reserve release for Walmart doesn't flow through the RSA, right? And then secondly, just on the disclosure change between oil and gas to the Payment Solutions segment, could you just talk about what drove that? Thanks. A \u2013 Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure Sanjay. So let me take your middle question first and just confirm what you said that the Walmart reserve release did not run through the RSA. So that was not a driver in terms of the quarter and what we recorded. The largest driver of that year-over-year increase in the RSA was really the lower core reserve build. We also saw a better overall performance in many of our programs, so that also pushed the rate up compared to the prior year. So program mix was a driver. And then, as you think about the balance of the year, now that our expectation is that core reserve build goes back into what we would consider a normal growth-driven reserve build in that $100 million to $150 million range, so that will bring that RSA percentage back down. We still expect the RSA to hit a seasonal high point in the third quarter, so no real change to that expectation. And then when you look at the balance of the year, we still expect it to be in the 4.0% to 4.2% range, so no change to what we communicated back in January. And then just on the movement on the oil and gas portfolios from retail credit to Payment Solutions. So really the idea there was now that the auto network, we're seeing really good growth there. Those cards can be used for gas now, but there is some real synergies in putting those programs together just strategically. And so that was really the rationale for the move. It did depress the purchase volume numbers in Payment Solutions a little bit year-over-year, so we reported 4% growth in purchase volume in Payment Solutions. If you adjust that for oil and gas purchase, volume would have been up 8%, so very much in line with receivables. Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. We have our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Q \u2013 Terry Ma : Hey good morning, this is Terry Ma in for Mark. I just wanted to get some color on how the PayPal growth has been trending. You mentioned receivables growth has been up 28% ex Walmart so just hoping you could disaggregate this so we could get a sense of how growth would trend toward the back half of the year? A \u2013 Margaret Keane : Yes. So I would say that the PayPal program is performing as we had expected it to perform. We said we've had great partnership with them. We are very integrated. We're really working on growing the program. But we had growth across some of our portfolios not just PayPal. So I'd say the core of the business is actually performing really well. I don't know Brian if you'd add anything to that. A \u2013 Brian Doubles : The only thing I would add is you're seeing outsized growth in the first half year related to PayPal just because we didn't have it the first half last year. That will be comping against similar periods with PayPal in the second half of the year and that's why we expect the growth rate to come down into that 5% to 7% range. But as Margaret said, we're still seeing really good growth on PayPal. Q \u2013 Terry Ma : Okay got it. Thanks. And just as a follow-up. How much OpEx takeout can we expect related to Walmart over the next few quarters? A \u2013 Brian Doubles : Yes I would say we're on track with what we communicated back when we made the announcement on Walmart. So we got very detailed plans. We're executing those across the business. If you just look at expenses more broadly, they were up 6% compared to the prior year. But that was really entirely driven by the PayPal Credit portfolio and the fact that we brought that on. If you exclude PayPal the program -- and exclude PayPal, the expenses were flat year-over-year. So that really is reflective of the fact that we're able to do some restructuring on certain areas of the business ahead of the Walmart portfolio sale later this year. So I think we feel pretty good about the cost takeout. The majority of the costs related to Walmart will come out after the portfolio moves later this year. Obviously, we're very focused on continuing to support that program. We're focused on ensuring a smooth transition. So the majority of those costs stay in place until the portfolio moves. So you really see the full benefit of the cost takeout in 2020. Q \u2013 Terry Ma : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : And we have our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Q \u2013 Rick Shane : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just wanted to dive in a little bit deeper on the PayPal portfolio versus the existing portfolio. Is there anything different that we should be thinking about behaviorally in terms of seasonality spending pay downs as we move through the year? And is there any different mix between fixed and floating rate loans versus the existing portfolio we should consider in terms of asset sensitivity? Brian Doubles : Yeah, Rick I wouldn't build anything in specific to PayPal. I mean we've -- just go through account what we have said in the past on PayPal. Obviously it runs at a slightly higher delinquency net charge-off profile. We did build in some APR increases to address that. And net-net you get back to a very similar return to that program relative to the rest of the portfolio. Seasonality and things like that look pretty similar. So there's nothing I would highlight specific to PayPal you should think about differently. Rick Shane : Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Rick. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I had a question on PayPal as well. Can you give us a sense; I really appreciate the additional disclosure on the impact of Walmart and PayPal on your credit metrics. But just qualitatively or maybe even more quantitatively, how's the PayPal portfolio performed since you acquired it in July? And then are you also trying to say that PayPal is still servicing those loans? So do you expect that servicing to transfer near term? And would that have a beneficial impact on the credit metrics in that portfolio once you transfer to your own servicing platform? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Yeah. So, first I'd say it's performing exactly like we thought it would perform and so both in terms of growth, in terms of delinquency, in terms of overall performance. So again we feel pretty happy about how the overall portfolio is performing. They are servicing the accounts now until we convert to our system, which will happen in June. And once that conversion happens it will be on our system. I don't anticipate a big shift in the performance of the portfolio because they're following our direction in terms of how to do it today and they're pretty good at what they do anyway. So I don't really see anything there. I think, obviously, we probably could get a little bit of cost leverage out of the cost part of this just because of our scale. Chris Brendler : Okay, great. One quick follow-up on Pets Best. Can you -- is that going to be a material impact to CareCredit revenue? I assume it's not a lending operation and insurance part is very interesting to me and just wanted to know how big it is in terms of\u2026 Margaret Keane : Yeah. It's not going to have -- it won't have a big impact on the\u2026 Brian Doubles : In the short term. Margaret Keane : \u2026in the short term. Chris Brendler : Great. Thanks, guys. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping you could give an update or some more details around the PayPal, sort of, APR repricing maybe the extent to which the newer APRs are finding their way into the overall book, and maybe what size the co-brand is versus the original Bill Me Later program. Brian Doubles : Yeah. So, we rolled those APR changes out earlier and they're going to bleed in over, I would say the balance of this year but into probably the first half of next year before we really feel the benefit of those. So right now if you look at the yield on the overall company, it was down a little over 20 basis points year-over-year. If you exclude PayPal, which does run at a lower yield than the overall business, yields would have actually been up slightly year-over-year. So that APR lift hasn't worked its way through the yield yet. You'll really see that towards the end of this year and into 2020. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Thanks. That was helpful. Brian Doubles : And what was the second part of your question, Matt? Matthew O\u2019Neill: That was it on PayPal. I did have an unrelated follow-up, however, on CECL. If you guys had any updated views on that as far as the discussion with the regulators. And maybe from a holistic perspective, are you guys looking at, or are the regulators looking at it inclusive of RSA and the implicit risk sharing? Or is it very focused on you guys alone? Brian Doubles : Yeah. That is great question. So we haven't put a range out there. Obviously, CECL will result in an increase to the level of the reserves just given we move from that incurred model to a lifetime coverage. We are currently running in parallel. We are working through some of the big areas of implementation like the life of a revolving product the payment allocation methodologies and things like that. There's some discussion out there that reserves are going to double for all credit card portfolio that is not our expectation. So, I would expect we'll probably put out a range most likely in the third quarter after we've run in parallel for a period of time. And then as you correctly highlighted the big open question on all this is how do the regulators view our capital going forward. In theory, the more reserves you set aside, you should need less capital for unexpected losses. But we're working through that with the regulators right now. In terms of the RSAs, we actually -- we factor in the RSAs in all of our stress tests they're built into our models. So, we do get credit for that buffering effect that the RSAs have in a stress scenario. So, we do factor that in. It is part of our stress testing models and our capital plans. Matthew O'Neill: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Brian Doubles : Great. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Can you just touch on the balances -- the balancing act between trying to drive deposit as a percent of your total funding and with the rates paid for those additional balances? And kind of what we've seen are some of the competitors have actually cut deposit rates on some of their products. So, what does that mean if you think about your funding costs going forward into 2019? Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. So, I would say a couple of things. First, when we look at our deposit beta it's actually been a little bit better than we expected through the rate cycle so far. So, our beta has been around 50%. That includes the period last year where we were pre-funding PayPal. During that time period, we were very competitive on rates. Just given some of the trends we are seeing so far this year as well as the fact that we don't have to pre-fund a large portfolio, we're actually hoping we won't need to be as competitive on rate this year. We've actually seen really strong deposit growth so far this year and we haven't moved our rates at all. So, look I think we expect to pay slightly higher betas than the norm. But with all that said it doesn't change our view that deposits are still our most attractive source of funds for the business. Dominick Gabriele : Absolutely. And then if I can ask one more. Can you talk about CareCredit and you've had some nice steady growth there in receivables year-over-year. And then how Walgreens and some of these new partnerships could potentially continue to accelerate that growth in CareCredit? Thanks so much. Margaret Keane : Yes sure. So, we see CareCredit as a big opportunity for us. Obviously, health care payments and general continue to go up for consumers and CareCredit really gives you the opportunity to segment those costs. And so what we've really been building out is a couple of things. One, continuing to grow the core by winning new partnerships; two, expanding the utility of the card so things like Walgreens is an example of that where we allow customers to buy outside of the -- the office they bought in but use that card in a Walgreens. And we are seeing really nice traction there. And then the third area we're really looking at is expanding into other verticals that we are not in today. So, last year alone we expanded into 25 different health care verticals. The one thing I would say is we never really want to be in a position where we are making some kind of credit decision related to health care life and death situations or anything like that. This is really all about those procedures that are elective procedures where consumers want to segregate that part of their expense. And so I would say we expect to continue to see really nice growth in CareCredit and we are looking at ways to really accelerate that growth in the verticals we are in today and verticals we're looking to expand into. So, pretty excited. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. Operator : And we have our next question from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a different angle on trying to get a sense for organic portfolio growth outside of PayPal. Just wondering on a no-name basis, when we look at the top five retail programs outside of PayPal, are any of those experiencing year-over-year declines in ending receivables? Margaret Keane : No. I don't believe any of them are. I think it's important to note that even if a retailer's sales are off, in most cases our credit card program is two times -- two to three times what the retailer sales are because our customer base that have the cards are the most loyal customers. And as retailers look to bring sales back into the store, obviously the card becomes a really big driver of that performance. So we have not seen deterioration in that way. Brian Doubles : Yes. The only thing I would add is look you can always have -- quarter-to-quarter, you can have some movement in any of these partnerships. But to Margaret's point, if you look over the long term whether its one year or two years, we are taking -- we're gaining penetration in all of our big programs and we feel pretty good about our position. Margaret Keane : I think the other piece that's important to note is the digital aspect. As we continue to build out the digital capabilities with our partners and that becomes an even bigger part of the channel, we are able to offset maybe some of the in-store traffic falloff with the omni-channel approach. And we know that if a customer buys mobilely and in store, they're the best customer. They tend to come back over and over. So we continue to use that data analytics to help our partners really grow those sales and continue to expand our digital capability. David Scharf : Got it. And you -- that response actually prefaced my follow-up which was whether or not there are any sort of wallet share type of metrics that you're able to share with us in terms of through the... Margaret Keane : I can kind of give you overall -- yes I can give you overall like mobile growth. So we said this quarter, we grew 37% on application growth versus the same quarter of last year. 48% of our applications are now occurring digitally, which is continues to grow and be a big part. So one of the things we see is customers before they even go to shop or actually applying through their mobile app or online to get the cards, obviously the value props are really important in this too in terms of how we work with our partners to get those value props in place. And in Retail Card, we had -- 37% of the sales were online sales. So again, this is a channel that continues to grow. We continue to grow really nicely in the digital sales. So again, we're pretty happy about the performance and expect that to continue to grow. David Scharf : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead, John. John Hecht : Sorry guys. Thanks guys. One side of question on PayPal. Is the amount of deferred interest for the net portfolio any different than the rest of the portfolio? Brian Doubles : It works similarly to the rest of the portfolio, John. John Hecht : Okay. And then most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess the final one I'd have or secondary one I'd have Brian is, when do you think you'll be able to talk publicly about the capital plans? I mean what -- when do you think that the regulators will be able to approve your plan and you'll get to the Board of Directors process and so forth? Brian Doubles : Yes. So like I said, we reviewed and the Board approved our plan. We submitted that to the regulators late March. So that's very much in line with what we did last year. So if you look at the last two years, we announced something around mid-May, so that would be our hope. Obviously, we don't control that entire process. But at least on our side, what we've done is try to follow a very similar process with both the Board and our regulators. So we're hopeful that we have a similar result this year in terms of timing. John Hecht : Appreciate that. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks, John. Greg Ketron : Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial.

The only authorized webcast are located on our Web site. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Before I get into the second quarter results, I'd like to outline some of the important changes we recently made at the executive level of the company. Brian Wenzel has been promoted to President. In this role, he is focused on accelerating key growth initiatives across the company deepening the integration of the key functions for which he is responsible. These include business strategy, venture investments and M&A, enterprise data analytics, marketing including digital platforms, customer experience and the expansion of the company's direct-to-consumer banking and product strategy. Brian Wenzel succeeds Brian Doubles as CFO. Brian has successfully served as Deputy Chief Financial Officer for the past year and as Chief Financial Officer for our retail card platform for more than 12 years. His experience imparts a broad perspective of our operations and a deep understanding of our people and partners. He will continue to focus on execution of our long-term financial and growth objectives. These changes underscore a dedication to our strategic priorities and drive to continue to grow and transform the business. I am proud of what these leaders have achieved thus far and I am confident that we have the right people in the right roles to lead us into the future. You will have an opportunity to hear from them today as Brian Doubles will cover our digital innovation and data analytics initiatives that are helping to drive growth. And Brian Wenzel will detail our financial results. I'll begin by providing an overview of our second quarter accomplishments on Slide 3. Our progress continued in the second quarter as our focus on driving growth both organically and through new partner programs across each of our sales platforms helped deliver strong results. Earnings of 853 million or a $1.24 per share included a reduction in the reserve related to the expected sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio which positively impact the results by $0.27. Loan receivables grew 4%, on a core basis excluding the Wal-Mart portfolio, loan receivables grew a strong 17%. Net interest income and purchase volume both grew double digits and average active accounts were up 9%. Our efficiency ratio of 31.3% is in line with our expectations. This has been achieved as we on-boarded to Paypal program. And I'm pleased to report that our conversion was successfully completed during the quarter. We look forward to continuing to partner with Paypal to develop innovative solutions to grow the program successfully. We have also continued to make investments in our Direct Deposit Program. During the quarter, we grew deposits 6.6 billion or 11% over last year and much of this growth has come through direct deposits. We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and launched a new program. In our payment solutions sales platform, we recently extended relationships with CCA Global Partners and Penske Automotive. We also added new programs with Samsung HDAC and Zero Motorcycles. During the quarter, we also launched our new program with Fanatics, the global leader in license sports merchandise. Together we are leveraging our deep expertise in data analytics to deliver personalized shopping experiences and enhance loyalty for fans. As you know a key strategic priority is to grow our network to great broader acceptance and utility of our cards. We have been particularly successful in doing that with our care credit network. This quarter we expanded our care credit network to include Lehigh Valley's physicians Group and the Baylor Scott White Medical Center in Sunnyvale Texas. We also renewed our relationship with Bosley and launched our partnership with Lighthouse. We remained highly focused on the risk adjusted returns of our programs, operating with a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we began executing our new capital plan which includes share repurchases of up to $4 billion in a planned increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share beginning in the third quarter. Overall, this is a strong quarter for us as we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives growing both organically and via new programs. Our investments in innovative digital technology, data analytics and seamless customer experiences are fundamental to our success. And Brian will outline some of those achievements shortly. Before I turn it over to him, I'll spend a few minutes on our sales platform results on Slide 4. In retail card, strong results were driven by our PayPal credit program acquisition, which was largely offset by the reclassification of the Wal-Mart portfolio. Loans were up 2%, but excluding the Wal-Mart portfolio, they were up 23%. Interest and fees on loans increased 16% over last year and purchase volume grew 14%. Average active accounts were up 11%. We are happy to have completed the conversion of the PayPal portfolio. This is a key relationship in the rapidly growing digital payment space and has expanded our capabilities within the merchant environment and through this partnership, we are providing an enhanced customer experience for thousands of merchants and consumers. We are very excited about the continued opportunities with this valued partner. We have worked hard to renew our relationships in the retail card space and have had great success in doing so. Currently 97% are retail card ongoing partner interest and fees on loans are under contract until 2022 and beyond. Payment solutions also delivered another solid quarter. We generated broad based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and power that resulted in loan receivable growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased 6% primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 4% and average active accounts increased 3%. Our initiative to develop and extend the utility of our payment solutions network cards has yielded solid results. We now have nearly 7 million cardholders in our Synchrony card care network with over 730,000 auto related locations nationwide where the card can be used. And we currently have approximately 5 million of Synchrony home cardholders that can use their cards at over 1 million locations. These networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse that now stands at approximately 30% of purchase volume excluding oil and gas have helped to drive growth and create significant opportunity for the future. Card credit continues to generate solid growth, receivables growth of 7% was led by dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans also increased 7% primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 7% an average active accounts increased 5%. With new partners on this quarter, we now have over 230,000 locations in the acceptance network and over 6 million active cardholders. We have significantly increased the network and utility of this card helping to drive the reuse rate to 54% of purchase volume in the second quarter. We delivered solid growth across our sales platforms as we continue to extend relationships, increased card utility, expand networks and provide value added solutions to our partners and cardholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. Good morning everyone. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5. We have made significant investments to develop leading digital technologies, which have been essential to delivering a seamless customer experience and helped us to drive both organic growth and acquire new programs. The rise of e-commerce and digital shopping experiences has required innovation to ensure that programs work seamlessly across whatever channel a customer uses. That means that cardholders must have access to their cards, rewards and account information across all channels seamlessly. Innovations such as digital apply, digital servicing and Synchrony plug-in or SyPi and help to meet the ever evolving requirements of our partners and their customers. Digital apply is a powerful tool for credit applications that we can configure to each partner. It is an adaptive and responsive user experience that integrates dynamic and intelligent presale to minimize the number of fields an applicant needs to enter and can pre-qualify known customers. It can also incorporate first purchase offers, coupons and incentives. Our digital servicing platform provides quick and easy access to key account servicing functionality that is optimized for the mobile experience. We have also developed virtual assistant servicing capabilities and Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Cardholders can do things like check their balance or make a card payment. Synchrony plug-in or SyPi is another powerful innovation that can quickly and seamlessly be integrated into a partner's mobile approximately. Through this platform, customers can apply for credit, service their account and check for and redeem earned rewards. These innovations are having meaningful impacts on our ability to grow our online mobile channels. The digital sales penetration for our retail card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 34% in the second quarter. Overall nearly 50% of our applications are happening online with the mobile channel alone growing 47% over the same quarter of last year. Furthermore, we now have over 2 billion of payments being made to SyPi and 200% average annual growth in visits since we launched the platform in July of 2016. While these are significant achievements, we are continuing to make important investments to stay ahead of this evolving landscape. We're focused on meeting customers where they are with the features they need and conveniences they may not yet have contemplated. Turning to Slide 6, as you know data and the ability to analyze and make it actionable has increasingly become an integral part of the success of our programs. We have developed an integrated data ecosystem that leverages a broad set of data assets from Synchrony, our retail partners and other external sources to transform customer experiences through personalized marketing, enhanced credit underwriting, optimized customer servicing and informed fraud strategies. We are developing transformative, innovative data and analytic capabilities driven by customer behavior data, which will enable us and our partners to engage with customers more deeply than ever before. It empowers us to provide the right experience to the right channel at the right time. The value of data analytics has demonstrated on Slide 6 of today's presentation where examples are provided to illustrate how data analytics is having a direct impact on program results. Through use of shared data and analytics we have been able to improve credit line assignments for certain partners best customers by 20% to 30%. This results in a better customer experience and drives more sales for our partners and at the same time provides improved economics for the program. Also enhanced customer segmentation powered by data and advanced analytics techniques has proven to lead to a reduction of observed fraud rates, customer behavior scores are good predictors of fraud. Customers that have low engagement with our partners have the highest propensity for fraud as much as 70 to 90 higher. Customer segmentation based on customer engagement with our partners also allows us to build more effective targeting and offer strategies for marketing campaigns. Increasing our campaign returns, while enhancing the customer experiences. These strategies help us drive increases in customer spending and higher account balances. Given the powerful results of data analytics, we will keep investing and it's an important component of our business focusing on new methods to leverage and activate integrated data assets to help drive program performance and enhance the user experience. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Brian. I'll start in Slide 7 of the presentation. This morning we reported second quarter earnings of $853 million or $1.24 per diluted share. This included a reduction in the reserve related to expected sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio. The reduction totaled $247 million or $186 million after tax and provide an EPS benefit of $0.27 for the quarter. We generated strong year-over-year growth in a number of areas as noted on Slide 8. Excluding the Wal-Mart portfolio, loan receivables were up 17% interest, and fees on loan receivables were up 14% over last year reflecting the addition of the PayPal credit program last year. We also continue to deliver solid organic growth. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generate across the business as well as the risk adjusted returns on this growth. Purchase volume was 12% an average active accounts increased 9% over last year. RSA has increased $206 million or 32% from last year. Growth including the PayPal credit program acquisition and improve program performance drove the increase. RSA's has a percentage of receivables was 0.9% for the quarter inline with our expectations. We continue to expect RSA's as a percentage of average receivables to be in a 4.0 to 4.2 range for 2019, which I will cover in more detail later. The provision for loan losses decreased $82 million or million, mainly driven by the reduction, the reserve related to the Wal-Mart portfolio partially offset by a core reserve build of $114 million in the quarter. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation  Other expenses increased $84 million or 9% versus last year driven primarily by expenses related to the addition of PayPal Credit program. So, overall the company continued to generate strong results in the second quarter. I will move to Slide 9, and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 11% driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal credit program and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.75% compared to last year's margin of 15.33% which include the impact of the pre-funding for the PayPal credit program acquisition and was in line with our expectations. We benefited from higher mix receivables as a percent of total earning assets compared to last year driven primarily by the PayPal Credit program acquisition and loan receivables growth. Also impacting net interest margin was a decline in loan receivables yield and an increase in interest bearing liabilities cost. The loan receivables yield was 20.94% a decline of 9 basis points versus last year mainly due to the impact of the PayPal Credit program acquisition. The increase in total interest bearing liabilities cost was 49 basis points to 2.73% predominantly from higher benchmark rates. We believe the net interest margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year with normal seasonality and some potential fluctuation around the Wal-Mart portfolio sale later this year. Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10, in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter also with our delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.43% compared to 4.17% last year and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.16% versus 1.98% last year. The increase in delinquency rates was primarily due to the reclassification of approximately $8 billion in Wal-Mart loan receivables to held for sale. The Wal-Mart consumer loan receivables that we expect to charge off prior to the expected portfolio sale remain in period end loan receivables which was approximately $400 million in loan receivables at quarter end. Given that we continue to report that delinquencies on the $400 million in end period loan receivables and a high percentage of these receivables are delinquent and represent the majority delinquent accounts in the Wal-Mart portfolio in total, the exclusion of the $8 billion and held for sale from period loan receivables skewed the reported rates higher. Also impacting delinquency rate to the addition of the PayPal Credit program acquired in the third quarter of 2018. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal credit program and the Wal-Mart portfolio, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 10 basis points and then 90 plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 5 basis points compared to last year reflecting stabilizing credit trends. Moving on to net charge offs. The net charge off rate was 6.10% compared to 5.97% last year and 6.06% last quarter and was somewhat lower than expectations due mainly to higher recovery levels. We had expected net charge offs to trend 20 to 30 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The recovery rate as a percentage of average receivables was 1.2% for the quarter and we had expected that rate closer to 1%. We had reported in prior quarters looking back to 2018. While credit trends continue to improve, this was partially offset by the impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the impact of the PayPal credit program and the Wal-Mart portfolio, net charge off rate was down approximately 5 basis points compared to last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.0% and a core reserve bill in the second quarter was $114 million excluding the impact from the reduction in reserves related to the Wal-Mart portfolio and in line with our expectations. Looking forward, we expect the core reserve build for the third quarter will be in $175 million range. This is higher than the second quarter due to an expected acceleration in loan receivable growth and the normal seasonality we see in the third quarter. Consistent with the outlook we provided in January, we expect to see some degree of acceleration in core loan receivables growth in the second half of this year. After taking into account that starting in the third quarter, we'll be comparing the period last year that include the PayPal Credit program. The acceleration in growth reflects the opportunities we have in the fast growing digital space as well as the diminishing impact on growth from declining sides of the Wal-Mart portfolio that remains and held for investment. Regarding future reductions in the loan loss reserve associated with the Wal-Mart portfolio. We now expect the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio will be completed in October. The remaining loan loss reserves held against the portfolio was approximately $350 million at the end of the second quarter. We expect the reduction in the reserve will be around $250 million in the third quarter with the remaining reduction occurring in the fourth quarter when the portfolio was sold. Regarding net charge offs. The third quarter net charge-off rate tends to be seasonally lower than the second quarter. The credit related purchase accounting impact from the PayPal Credit program acquisition in July of last year was also a significant driver and 100 basis point decline in net charge offs in the third quarter from the second quarter of last year. We expect the decline to be more modest this year and more in line with historical declines of 40 to 50 basis points from the second quarter. This is in line with our expectations and included in our 2019 net charge-off outlook. We continue expect net charge offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase entirely driven by the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio partially offset by the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio later this year. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Wal-Mart, net charge-off rate was expected to be similar to 2018. Before I wrap up discussion on credit trends, I want to give you some visibility on our initial thoughts around the implementation of CSO beginning in 2020. We are finalizing our assumptions with alternatives that remain under evaluation and we are still analyzing a number of factors for potential inclusion or exclusion based on the predictive capabilities over time. We have commenced parallel testing on our core model and our models are undergoing validation testing. We also continue to work with and obtain feedback from regulators. While these key factors remain open based on our current view our preliminary estimate from the initial impact would have been 50% to 60% increase in the total allowance for loan losses compared to what we have reported at the end of the second quarter. [Indiscernible] impact will depend upon the composition and asset quality of the portfolio, the economic conditions and forecasts upon adoption in addition to the factors I noted previously. In summary credit trends have leveled off and are showing improvement in line with our expectations and we expect the trends to continue to show [stay low] [ph] as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth and attractive risk adjusted returns. Moving to Slide 11, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion up 9% over last year and we're primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program. Year-to-date expenses are up 7%. We do expect the expense growth rate to slow in the second half of this year due to the following factors. First, beginning with the third quarter, we'll begin comparing against quarters post the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio. In addition to this, will be the favorable impact on expenses after the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio later this year. The efficiency ratio was 31.3% for the quarter here last year level and in line with expectations. Moving to Slide 12, over the last year we've grown our deposits $6.6 billion or 11% primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 75% of our funding compared to 73% last year. In June, we issued $850 million in secured debt out of our Synchrony Card Issuance Trust. The issuance has a three year-term with a fixed rate of 2.34% that strong demand and were significantly oversubscribed. Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.3% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel 3 rules. This compares to 16.3% on a fully phased in basis last year reflecting the impact of the capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program, organic growth and continued execution of our capital plans. On May 9, we are pleased to announce our new capital plan through June 30, 2020. Our Board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.22 per share commencing in the third quarter and share repurchase program of up to $4 billion, which includes the capital freed up from the expected sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio. We began to execute our new plan in May repurchasing shares totaling $725 million during the second quarter. This represented 21.1 million shares repurchased during the quarter. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $23.7 billion which equate to 22.3% of our total assets. This is down from over 28% last year reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity for the PayPal Credit program acquisition. Overall, we continue to execute the strategy that we outlined previously. We're committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue to deploy capital through the growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view for the third quarter and the year. Overall, the net interest margin performed in line with our expectations for the second quarter. We believe the net interest margin will continue to run at 15.75% to 16% range for the year with the normal seasonality as well as some potential fluctuation around the Wal-Mart portfolio sale later this year. RSA as a percentage of average receivables were 3.9% for the quarter in line with our expectations. We continued to expect the RSA percent to be in the 4.0% to 4.2% range for 2019. Regarding credit we expect the core reserve bill for the third quarter to be largely driven by growth in a normal seasonality we see in the third quarter and we'll be in $175 million range. We now expect to sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio to be completed in October. The remaining loan loss reserve held against the portfolio was approximately $350 million at the end of the second quarter. We expect a reduction in the reserve to be round $250 million in the third quarter with the remaining reduction occurring in the fourth quarter when the portfolio was sold. We still expect net charge offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase over 2018 entirely driven by the impact from the PayPal Credit portfolio partially offset by the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio later this year. Excluding effects of PayPal and Wal-Mart the net charge-off rate is expected to be similar to 2018. The third quarter net charge-off rate tends to be seasonally lower than the second quarter. The decline from last year's second quarter to the third quarter of 100 basis points was also driven by the credit related purchase accounting impact from the PayPal Credit program acquisition. We expect the decline to be more modest this year and more in line with historical trends of 40 to 50 basis points. Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive risk adjusted returns. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A. Greg Ketron : That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Credit Suisse we have Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Margaret Keane : Yes. All right. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks. Sorry about that. So I guess maybe the -- given that you're now pretty close to transitioning out of Wal-Mart and talking about the potential for acceleration in organic loan growth. Could you talk about how PayPal figures into that? I mean that relationship was growing probably 25% or 30% before and has the potential to expand significantly through and so talk about how you're thinking about that as a vehicle for driving overall loan growth? Margaret Keane : Yes. So far, the first thing that's really great that we've completed the conversion which was a fairly significant sized conversion for us and that went really seamlessly which we're really excited about. And I think now we can refocus our attention on a list of initiatives we have that really are targeted to drive growth for the program. I think we have our teams working closely together, I would say it's a really strong partnership and we're really working on both technology enhancements as well as program enhancements to really be even more integrated as we go into the marketplace and really work with the merchant base of PayPal, so we see this as a big part of our growth story going forward. Moshe Orenbuch : Great thanks. And maybe switching gears just a little bit despite getting a late start during the quarter you were able to buyback over $700 million worth of the stock. I mean are you looking to kind of continue at a similar pace. Like how should we think about the deployment of that 4 billion? Brian Doubles : Great. Thanks Moshe. The way I would think about it is, you have a core capital return plan based upon our earnings. If you look at how the Wal-Mart capital gets freed up we had $522 million of reserves which released in the first quarter, $247 million in the second quarter. We've guided to $250 million in third and $100 million in the fourth. When you tax effect that and then look at the capital it gets released upon the portfolio conveyance in the fourth quarter that's kind of how you should think about how capital gets freed up and the gains you can think about for 2019. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : From Jefferies we have John Hecht. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Thanks very much guys. You guys spent a bit more time talking about digital innovation and that kind of greater activity from online activity and Internet-based activity. I'm wondering just at a high level over time should we expect that to reduce customer acquisition costs or servicing costs. Brian Wenzel : Yes, John. Hey, this is Brian. Yes, absolutely. I think this is an area that continues to be a real strength for us. It's an area that we've been investing pretty heavily in over -- really the last five years. I think it's -- if you look at our investment in pay phone, our acquisition of GPShopper. We're now getting 50% of our apps through the digital channel. If you look at mobile we've seen 47% growth year-over-year really good online sales penetration at retail card, it's about 3x the national average. And so, as we think about it it's really -- its acquisition all the way through servicing and paying your bill. And so, part of this is clearly an efficiency play. We love the fact that customers can apply for credit. It reduces our acquisition costs all the way to the back-end making a payment and not having to call somebody in customer service. But I think if you look even beyond that. This is really helping us drive organic growth, but also helping us when new programs, so it's a real differentiator for us. John Hecht : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. I guess you guys are the first card company to give this quarter -- to give some a little bit more detailed guidance around CESO. I'm wondering within the guidance you gave us out of curiosity as much as anything is that you what's the duration that I guess in the different portfolios you have that they assigned or that you assigned? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks John. We really can't get into too much detail around some of those assumptions. Obviously, we are primarily a card based company. We have some commercial products, but again, we're working through those assumptions now going through the various constituencies we have where there are accounts or participants in and when we generally believe we're in line with other card issuers. John Hecht : Understood. Thank you guys very much. Brian Wenzel : Thanks John. Operator : From JPMorgan, we have Rick Shane. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Hey guys. Thank you for taking my questions this morning. And congratulations Brian and Brian on your respective new role. When I look at the sort of preliminary work on CESO that suggests, if you were to implement today a CET11 in the high 11, low 12 type range please correct me if you think I'm wrong there. But, I am curious given that this is a lot of geography how you will look at your CET1 targets going forward and will you consider lowering those targets? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you. The first thing I'd say is that, obviously the range we announced this morning doesn't really impact our capital plan. First of all for [Technical Difficulty] going through the period 2020. As we think about capital, the posting of these additional reserves really, really creates additional loss absorption capacity which reduces our unexpected buffer really in the capital range. So when we think about it, we obviously believe that we should get credit for posting these losses and really reduce our capital threshold or CET1 threshold. That's discussions we've begun to have with our regulators and work out over time. But again, this loss absorption capacity is being built through the posting of reserves should allow us to lower this CET1 ultimately over time is our belief. Rick Shane : And we certainly agree. I'm curious you've mentioned that you're in conversations with the regulators the other constituent there would be the rating agencies what are they say? Brian Wenzel : Our discussion with the rating agencies preliminarily has been that they don't believe CESO is really a credit event. They understand the loss absorption capacity. We're familiar with their models and we're in discussions with them as well about how we think about the additional buffer that's put in by posting these reserves upfront. So, we are engaged with both of our agencies. Rick Shane : Sure. Thank you so much. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Operator : From Goldman Sachs we have Ryan Nash. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Ryan Nash : Maybe I can ask a question on the 175 million of reserve build that you're expecting in the third quarter. Should we think about that as a new run rate as growth improves? And I guess related to that historically when you talked about a 150 million to 200 million of core reserve built, you were growing in the 8% to 9% range. Is that how we should maybe think about where loan growth could be headed over time? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Great. Thank you. The way I think about it is, our reserves going forward should primarily be growth driven. What we see as we look into the back half of this year, we see an acceleration of growth as we move forward [Technical Difficulty] stable growth of 3% the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter. We guided to 5% to 7% range and we expect that growth to accelerate in the back half of the year really through all of our programs and platforms. We're seeing terrific growth out of our payment solutions platform through the expansion of the auto and home network there. Through care credit and the broader acceptance is happening there as well as Brian has kind of highlighted some of our fast growing digital channels. So we do see an acceleration in the back half of the year in growth. And again, the reserve should be primarily growth driven as we move forward. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then, maybe if I can ask a follow up on Rick's question regarding CESO. So, you obviously have several years for the implementation just wanted to get a sense for when you think about capital return going forward, how you think about the ability to use the three year phase in? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. You are right. The capital impact would be phased in over three years as part of our capital is going to originate through regulators we incorporated our initial estimate of CESO into that and we will continue to work with them. With regard to how that's treated again, we think about it as building losses absorption capacity and our CET1 rate should come down over time and be in line with peers first of all. But, taking account the fact that we're posting these higher reserves. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my question. Thank you. Operator : From Nomura we have Bill Carcache. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Hi. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this but my first question is for Brian Wenzel. Hey, Brian, can you discuss how we should be thinking about the impact of a more accommodative Fed and maybe any color that you can give us on the impact of each 25 basis point cut? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you. Let me start with the second one as far as the interest rate environment. Obviously, we know what's modeled out there today which is a forecast of three movements. We have done several models and scenarios where we've looked at the impact of rates on our business. And generally when you think about our business or assets and liabilities are fairly well-matched against each other. And we really try not to take exposure to rates. So we're fairly balanced whether it's a rising rate environment or declining rate environment. So, when we look at those models that we've done, we're fairly comfortable or comfortable with that. The net interest margin for the year will be in the 15.75% to 16% range. And then we've had the ability really to manage our retail deposits and CD business. And we've lowered rates on CDs 5x since April this year with lower high yield savings really relating to the competition of the market and where the interest rate forecast is going. So we felt comfortable that we can deliver on our net interest margin again given our balance sheet we're not really exposed to interest rate movements. With regard to the accommodative Fed, we obviously work with them on CESO and capital, they obviously know there's a large transition that's going on in the market for participants and they understand that I think are going to be fairly flexible in the short term. Bill Carcache : That's great. Thank you. Separately I had another question for Brian Doubles. Thanks Brian for the new slides and the commentary on the impact of digital innovation on your growth. There's been a lot of focus on the digital investments that some of your less efficient competitors are making for example in public cloud technology. Can you give us a sense of how to think about the impact of your digital investments on your operating efficiency over time, is there room for your digital investments to benefit both the numerator and the denominator of your efficiency ratio such that we can expect further improvements from your already industry leading levels. Any color on that would be great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Bill. I mean absolutely I think we view digital as a big initiative for us both in terms of driving growth, driving revenue for our partners. Again, existing partners but also winning new relationships. And every time we win a new relationship obviously given our scale, we get real efficiencies and real operating leverage there. But, then if you look at everything that one of our customers does through a digital channel saves us money. It saves us money the more we're able to move towards e-statements and people checking their statements on either in the app or online whether they're making payments through the app and we have now over 2 billion of payments that are coming through our SyPi apps. I think these are all things that drive real efficiency for the company. So I would absolutely think about it as driving both top-line growth, revenue growth as well as operating efficiency. Bill Carcache : It's very helpful. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks Bill. Operator : From Wells Fargo we have Don Fandetti. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Hey, good morning. So, Brian.. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Don. Don Fandetti : Thank you. So on the NIM, I think in the last quarter you said that NIM would be down slightly in Q2. It feels like it's down a little more than that but you've mentioned it's in line with your internals, it kind of maybe a tiny bit towards the lower end of your internal or is it just bouncing around? And then I have a credit question. Brian Doubles : Yes. The net margin was right where we expected to be in line with expectations. As they move sequentially, there was a decline in [indiscernible] which is primarily related to the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio, a slight shift in the [indiscernible] with our loan receivables down 50 basis points versus the first quarter and then nine basis points of pressure from our interest expense. So again, it was in line with where we thought it would be and for the year, again we still expect 15.75% to 16%. Don Fandetti : Okay. And then, I think Synchrony is largely through their underwriting adjustments that started back in 2015 or '16. But if take those mixed signals out in the card business right now at least in general purpose you have companies like JPMorgan accelerating growth CapitalOne raising, potentially raising lines. Within private label, what are you seeing competitors do in terms of underwriting tightening and do you think that the industry is actually shifting to a little bit more of an aggressive card lending sort of positioning overall. Brian Doubles : Yes. I can't really speak for what others are doing in the industry what I would say is, we made some refinements back in the '16 and '17 timeframe. We make refinements every day based upon what we see in the portfolios and channels that we operate in. We are not I'd say making significant changes either opening the credit throttle or closing the credit throttle and we are operating the portfolio. And I think you can see through our results when you look at 30 plus and 90 plus delinquencies ex PayPal and Wal-Mart being deep down year-over-year that we see stabilizing [Technical Difficulty]. So, we're not in a position where we're going to take actions either way as we move forward here. So we're comfortable with credit how it is performing, the vintages as we look at them, the 17, I'm sorry, the 18 vintage is performing in line and back to almost the '16 or '15 vintage and the early results on our '19 vintage are in line with '18. So, we're comfortable with where credit is at and we're not taking any significant changes. Don Fandetti : Okay. And then on the recoveries, are you seeing better pricing or was this just kind of like a bulk sale, a little bit of color on the higher recoveries. I know they can bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Brian Wenzel : Recoveries again this quarter was 1.2% of our average loan receivables, so better than we expected and what we guided to really from the first quarter. And we're seeing that one we are seeing better pricing across most of our channels. We're seeing greater demand from the participants in the marketplace. So obviously, we were a little bit more opportunistic as I think about the first half of the year. But, I'd say overall recovery outside of those onetime transactions and flow arrangements recoveries, the results and performance is better than our expectations. Don Fandetti : Thanks Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Operator : From Morgan Stanley we have Betsy Graseck. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Question on -- I just wanted to understand a bit about PayPal. I know you've very nicely carved out the NCO x PayPal and Wal-Mart and just then also the loan growth outlook. I'm just looking to understand as we think about your go-to-market strategy with PayPal because I would think that this is a portfolio that has opportunity for a significant loan growth and spend growth. And just wanted to understand how you're toggling that with the credit side. Margaret Keane : Yes. We work closely with PayPal in terms of how we're building out this global strategies with them. And they're pretty sophisticated on the credit side. So, I think we're going to approach this in a thoughtful way. And as Brian said, there's no plans to just open up the throttle in any way or treat PayPal any differently than our other portfolios and the environment we're in right now. But, I can say that the integration of two of us how we think about marketing and really the -- a lot of the growth that really is important on the digital front is really around placement and offers. And I think PayPal is really good at this and we're working very closely with them to make sure we're offering the credit in the right places. And that really makes a big difference in terms of the quality of the customer that you get in and your ability to approve accounts. Brian Wenzel : The only thing I would probably add to that is, while PayPal operates at a slightly higher net charge off rate than the portfolio itself, the risk adjusted margin and the returns that we get of that portfolio really compensate for that. And again, when you contemplate that relative issue Wal-Mart [indiscernible] this year obviously from a credit perspective, we're better off as a company. Betsy Graseck : Yes. No, definitely, I'm just thinking also that obviously this is a mobile online customers that and as a result think that that generates a little bit higher rev growth overall. Is that accurate? Margaret Keane : Yes. It's a fast growing payment platform I would say. Betsy Graseck : And then just a follow question is regarding the outlook for capital I know you touched on it earlier, but if we've got the Fed coming out with this tailoring rule and you guys don't even have to do CESO, I know you opt-in in your own way. But when you read the tea leaves of what's going on with how the Fed is thinking about the SCB and how it's thinking about the tailoring rule, should we be anticipating that you can have a lower starting point for what your stress levels of capital are or does that some of these new portfolios change that and say well that's an offset so we should still be running at the capital levels that we've been talking about. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So only just clarifying, I wish we say we can opt-in as [indiscernible] unfortunately that is a requirement for us. As I think about capital as we move forward here, obviously we're very comfortable with the resiliency of the earnings of our business the way in which performs the returns of our business as well as offsets and we look at that. And then begin to look at the impact of CESO, we believe that we're going able to drive down our CET1 ratio because right now we're in excess of peers. We're migrating down when we started a number of years ago at 18% down. We believe we'll be able to be in line with our peers over the long-term. So, we don't really expect an impact from those rules on us. Betsy Graseck : Eleven-ish or something like that is really where peers are kind of triangulating too. So that's what makes sense for you. Brian Wenzel : Yes. I can't comment exact long-term target, but again we are working to get in line with our peers, given the profile of our business that's where we think we should operate. And that's the discussions that we're having with them. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Now, I get that okay. And so if the Fed is kind of like migrating a little bit even lighter with the tailoring rule et cetera, you'll just follow the path on that? Brian Wenzel : Obviously as the rules come out we'll assess them and engage in dialogue and be compliant with them. So again, we'll be nimble. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Betsy Graseck : Thanks Margaret. Operator : From KSP Research, we have Kevin St. Pierre. Please go ahead. Kevin St. Pierre: Hi. Good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin St. Pierre: Brian, I'd just like to better understand the 17 basis point decline into average credit card yields in the quarter. You touched on it a moment ago, but I just wanted to dig into that. Is it mixed a bit low or moderate, what drove that? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So, when you look at it we are seeing a slightly higher revolve rate in the core business and some of the impact again of the interest rates movement is moving into the portfolio. The yield decline is solely related to where the majority of is related to the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio that comes in at a lower yield. But again, we took pricing actions last year on the portfolio. They begun to take effect into the book but they take a long time under new [Kodak] [ph] rules and we expect that to be fully in a run rate basis in 2020. So it's really the acquisition of PayPal Credit that's driving the decline. Kevin St. Pierre: Got it. Thanks. And then as a follow up. In terms of expenses and particularly marketing and business development maybe it's just me watching too much golf and tennis, but I've certainly noticed a big increase in the commercials and the advertising. Where should we think that line item goes over time? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Again, our marketing and business development line that will fluctuate a little bit with regard to campaigns when we do reissuances, we relaunch value proposition. So there is some variability with that. We are not a big spender in commercials things like that. We've done some things in order to position our brand externally -- but that's -- we're not going to migrate into other peers, it's been tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars into that it's just more thoughtful branding. Again, we expect that to grow generally in line with their volume and loan receivable growth. Kevin St. Pierre: Great. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I guess Brian, I wanted to follow up on the NIM and the yield trajectory. You mentioned the PayPal repricing. As we look to next year, is it safe to assume that all else equal. I know rates might move around a little bit and that might affect your assets, but the trend is higher on the yield because of the repricing tailwind that you have related to PayPal? And then, secondly, similar question on expenses, I think I heard you say that expenses have been elevated related to PayPal and Wal-Mart as we think through some of the exit run rate into next year for the efficiency ratio. Should that be also a good guy for the efficiency ratio as we move into next year as you don't have those costs in the run rate. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So let me deal with your margin question first, Sanjay. As we kind of go in there, we will obviously get the run rate of PayPal from the CIT come in. We're not providing today's specific guidance as it relates to 2020 as we'll do that in January as part of a more comprehensive look. The biggest change obviously is Wal-Mart portfolio coming out which operates at a higher net interest margin relative to its losses. So there will be some effect there, we'll provide more guidance to you in January with regard to the trends and we'll certainly have greater visibility to work through interest rate environments doing. With regard to expenses again, we're projecting 31% or going to 31% for the year. We're very comfortable with that. As you think about going into 2020 again we'll provide guidance on that. Obviously, we've converted from an interim servicing basis this quarter from PayPal to us so there's be some line item shifts that happen in there. So that will be fully in the run rate. And again, we started to implement some of the Wal-Mart cost out and be any part of the year for some of the fixed costs. In the back half of the year particularly in the fourth quarter, you'll see the variable costs come out, now we'll get into the run rate as we move into 2020. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. My follow up question for Margaret is just simply on the micro competitive environment. One of your peers talked about the online players being a bit more competitive in the market. I think I've heard you guys talk about it as well maybe you could just flush that discussion out and just talk about the pipeline going forward. I know you're absorbing quite a big deal right now, but as we look to the pipeline of future deals how does that look. Margaret Keane : Yes. I would say we're excited about where the businesses position right now and we do feel like we're winning because of our digital capability, our data analytics capability and some of the things we continue to build out. I would say there's not a lot of big deals out there Sanjay. A couple of big deals maybe in the next two, three years will come up, but our pipeline and all three platforms is pretty robust. And what we're trying to make sure we do is ensure we're winning the deals that meet the returns that we're comfortable with. But I think there's enough out there that we feel confident that we can win both existing portfolios and startups. Sanjay Sakhrani : All right, great. Thank you. Greg Ketron : Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019ll begin by providing an overview of our third quarter accomplishments on Slide 3. We continue to deliver strong results this quarter. Earnings of 1.1 billion or $1.60 per share included a reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart consumer portfolio, which positively impacted results by $0.38 in the third quarter. Loan receivables were down 5%. However, on a Core basis, excluding the Walmart Portfolio loan receivables grew 6%. Net interest income grew 4%, purchase volume was up 5% and average active accounts increased 2%. Our efficiency ratio of 30.8% was down from 31% in the prior year and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we grew deposits 3.7 billion or 6% over last year and much of this growth has come through direct deposits. Our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth and we are making ongoing investments to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers. Brian will detail some of our efforts here shortly. We are pleased to share our recent partnership renewals and extensions. In our Retail Card sales platform, we announced the expansion and extension of our strategic consumer credit relationship with PayPal. We will become the exclusive issuer of a Venmo\u2019s co-branded consumer credit card, which will launch in the second half of 2020. The new Venmo credit card program will combine Venmo\u2019s expertise in mobile design and social user experience with Synchrony\u2019s industry leading technology and data analytics to create personalized shopping and payment experiences for Venmo customers. We also extended our existing relationship with PayPal. This is a new milestone in our 15-year strategic partnership with PayPal in which we continue to leverage our digital technology and expertise to help our partner grow their business through new innovative consumer experiences. We also renewed our partnership with DICK'S Sporting Goods, a leading omnichannel sporting goods retailer that offers an extensive assortment of sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. Building on a nearly two-decade partnership, this agreement will continue to provide customers with special financing promotions and accelerated rewards program and digital account management through the score rewards branded credit card and co-branded Mastercard credit programs. These cards can be used on dsg.com and across their 700 plus retail stores, including DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods, Golf and Galaxy and Field & Stream. This strategic partnership strengthens the intersection of digital and instore customer experiences for DICK\u2019s card holders. In Payment Solutions, we had another active quarter for renewals. Recently signing renewals with Polaris, La-Z-Boy and Conn's. Growing our network to create broader acceptance and utility for our cards is a key priority. We have had many recent successes on that front in our CareCredit network. We continue to extend CareCredit\u2019s network of more than 230,000 healthcare providers and retailers nationwide that accept the CareCredit Card, including 8,500 plus Walgreens and Duane Reade stores. We also added Loyale, wherein CareCredit will be offered as a payment option on Loyale patient financial manager, an end-to-end patient financial engagement platform. This provides consumers more locations where they can use the CareCredit Card for their health and wellness needs. We also signed a new partnership with St. Luke\u2019s University Health Network. We are also focused on innovative digital technology, data analytics, and seamless customer experiences all of which are fundamental to the success of our existing programs and to winning new ones as we have proven. We continue to invest in digital innovations to ensure our core holders have access to their cards, rewards, and account information across whatever channel they choose to use. The digital sales penetration across all of our retail card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 35% in the third quarter. Overall, 50% of our applications are happening online with the mobile channel alone growing 22% over the same quarter of last year. Our capital allocation strategy drives strong growth at attractive risk adjusted returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet, and the ability to return capital to shareholders.  During the quarter, we repurchased 550 million of Synchrony Financial common stock and paid 145 million in dividends. Overall, it was a strong quarter. We made progress on a strategic initiative. We continue to develop our digital and data capabilities, which is helping us to win in the marketplace and we are making investments in our direct-to-consumer business. We maintain broad-based growth growing both organically and via new programs and we continue to expand our network. All of this is happening as we maintain focus on the future and the dynamics that are reshaping the consumer experience. Earlier this month, we successfully completed the sale and conversion of the Walmart portfolio and program. I would like to thank our team for working hard to deliver excellent service ensuring the customer was a top priority throughout the process and executing a seamless transition. Before I turn the call over to Brian to discuss our progress in our direct-to-consumer business, I will highlight our platform results on Slide 4. In Retail Card, strong results were driven by our digital partners, which was largely offset by the reclassification of the Walmart portfolio. Loans were down 11%, but excluding the Walmart portfolio they were up 5%. Interest and fees on loans increased 6% over last year and purchase volume grew 5%. Average active accounts were up 1%. We are happy to expand and extend our relationship with PayPal through the addition of the Venmo co-branded consumer credit card. We are also happy to renew our relationship with DICK's Sporting Goods, which includes their Golf Galaxy, and Field & Stream brands. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. We generated broad based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and power that resulted in loan receivables growth of 7%. Interest and seasonal loans increased 6%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 5%, and average active accounts increased 3%. We renewed key partnerships this quarter continuing to drive growth organically to our partnerships and also through our Payment Solutions card network. The Synchrony Home and Synchrony card care credit cards. These loans networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 29% of purchase volume excluding oil and gas has helped to drive results and further build the payment solutions platform for future growth. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 8% was led by dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts increased 4%. We continue to expand our network and the utility of our cards helping to drive the reuse rate to 54% of purchase volume in the third quarter. We drove strong growth across our sales platforms. We extended and expanded relationships, grew our payment solutions in CareCredit network, and increased card utility. All providing a strong base for continued future growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. Good morning everyone. My comments today will center on our efforts to diversify to our direct-to-consumer channel starting on Slide 5. Among our top strategic partners is evolving and growing our business through the development of new Synchrony branded products and services. More specifically, our objective is to become a leading digital bank with competitive products and capabilities that drive deeper customer relationships and provide an attractive source of funding, while also launching innovative lending products. While we\u2019ve been introducing synchrony branded consumer products over the past two years through our Synchrony card care and Synchrony home offerings. We have also recently been focused on the Synchrony branded general-purpose card. Today, I will spend a few minutes outlining how we are progressing on both our banking platform and the general-purpose card.  First, on our deposit products. We have made significant progress over the last several years in building our consumer banking from platform. Our deposits are growing faster than the U.S. direct banking industry and we have expanded market share over the last several years. Deposits currently comprised 76% of our funding profile. With consumer deposits becoming an increasingly larger portion of our mix of total funding. The investments we\u2019ve made over the past few years have enabled us to rely less on rate to attract new deposit accounts. Our strategic investments have been focused on enhancing our digital advertising, developing the right content and message to the right audiences, as well as enhancing our digital experience. For example, we launched our New Native App earlier this year, as well as redesigned our marketing side with a better user interface and overall customer experience. On Slide 6, you can see the results of our efforts. Over the past several years, we have grown deposits 20% per year versus an industry growth rate of 5%. During that time period, we have also been less reliant on rate and have successfully reduced our savings product rates below the competition as shown on the slide. We have also reduced our acquisition cost by 20% in the last three years. We remain focused on making investments to reduce rate sensitivity and acquisition costs. As we look ahead, we plan to invest in additional capabilities, products, and features. We will also continue to improve customer service and launch differentiated rewards and loyalty programs, all of which not only will drive a better customer experience, but also allow us to continue to grow efficiently and effectively.  Importantly, we are focused on all aspects of the customer experience, starting with a quick seamless account opening process all the way through self-servicing features once the account is opened. We are confident that we have built a solid foundation from which to build for the future objective in the deposit platform. Similarly, on the lending side, we have made significant progress with our general-purpose cards. As you will recall, we successfully rebranded Toys R Us accounts that qualified for a Synchrony MasterCard, which was a substantial portion of the portfolio. This was a cost-effective way to expand into the general-purpose card market, while also providing continuous and improved utility for our formal cardholders. Slide 7 highlights our initial results for this product. We had a strong activation rate and repeat usage. In fact, we have also increased sales per account by 40% and balances per account by 50%. At the same time, we are [indiscernible] as we no longer pay the RSA and use those savings to fund the value prop on the cards. Approaching a general-purpose credit card in this manner has allowed us to utilize an iterative test and learn approach to growth. We\u2019re leveraging customer insights and data to test general-purpose card value propositions and features with consumers. At launch, we offered an attractive 2% cash back value proposition, as well as spend incentives, which delivered a strong card and spend activation rate.  We are currently testing different combinations of APRs, promotional offers, and incentives. We are taking a very disciplined approach to future product offerings, value propositions and features. Looking ahead, we will target our marketing efforts to customer segments where we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns. While our growth expectations are modest in the short-term given the disciplined nature of our approach we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and early results we\u2019ve been able to achieve so far. As we seek to diversify our offerings in the direct-to-consumer space, we will leverage the strong foundations we have built. We are evaluating opportunities across a large and diverse market and we're very excited about our prospects in this space. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8 of the presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $1.1 billion or $1.60 per diluted share. This included the reduction in the reserve related to the sales of Walmart consumer portfolio on October. As Margaret noted earlier, the reduction totaled $326 million or $248 million after tax and provided an EPS benefit of $0.38 to the quarter. Now that the portfolio sale and program conversion is complete, I will provide some details on how this and other factors impact our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. We generate strong year-over-year growth in a number of areas as noted on Slide 9. Excluding the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables were up 6%. Interest and fees on loan receivables were also up 6% over last year, driven by the growth in receivables. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk adjusted returns on this growth. Purchase volume growth was 5% and average active accounts increased 2% over last year. Excluding the impact of the Walmart program, purchase volume growth of 7%, and average active account growth was 3%. RSA's increased $145 million or 17% from last year. Improved program performance and growth drove the increase. RSA as a percentage of average receivables was 4.5% for the quarter. The provision for loan losses decreased $432 million or 30% from last year, mainly driven by the reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart portfolio. The core reserve build was $124 million in the quarter. Other expenses increased $10 million, 1% over last year, driven by growth that was partially offset by the cost savings executed in advance of the Walmart portfolio sale and program conversion. Holding expenses essentially flat enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage for the quarter, reflecting the improvement in an efficiency ratio from 31% last year to 30.8% this quarter. So, overall, the company continued to generate strong results in the third quarter. I\u2019ll move to Slide 10 to cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 4%, driven primarily by the growth in loan receivables. The net interest margin was 16.29%, compared to last year's margin of 16.41%, down 12 basis points. The manufacturers driving the margin performance were, factors lowering our net interest margin include a slightly lower mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets, compared to last year and an increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost of 35 basis points to 2.71%, primarily due to higher benchmark rates. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in loan receivables yield of 31 basis points to 21.42%, which include the purchase accounting impact related to the PayPal credit program in the prior year. Later in the call, I will provide more insight on the direction of net interest margin for the fourth quarter, including the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I\u2019ll start with delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.47%, compared to 4. 59% last year, and a 90 plus delinquency rate was 2.07% versus 2.09% last year. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal credit program, and the Walmart portfolio, the 30 plus delinquency rate was flat to last year, and the 90 plus delinquency rate improved approximately 5 basis points, compared to last year, reflecting continued stabilizing credit trends. Moving on to net charge offs. Net charge-off rate was 5.35%, compared to 4.97% last year and 6.01% last quarter and was somewhat lower than our expectations over 40 basis points to 50 basis point decline from the second quarter. While credit trends continued to improve, this was partially offset by the purchase accounting impact in 2018 related to the PayPal credit program. Excluding the impact of the PayPal credit program and the Walmart portfolio, net charge-off rate was approximately 20 basis points lower than last year. The allowance for the loan losses as a percent of loan receivables was 6.74% and the core reserve build in the third quarter was $124 million, excluding the impact from the reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart portfolio. The reduction related to the Walmart portfolio was $326 million, which was higher than the expected $250 million, due to the timing of the portfolio of sale occurring earlier in October. As a result, the remaining reduction in loan loss reserve in the fourth quarter will be in the $35 million to $40 million range. We expect the core reserve bill for the fourth quarter will be in the $102 million to $150 million range, driven mainly by growth. Consistent with the outlook we provided, we did see stronger core loan receivable growth in the third quarter of 6% and believe this will continue into the fourth quarter. The acceleration in growth reflects the opportunities we have in the fast-growing digital space and an expansion of our network and acceptance in CareCredit and the auto and home networks and payment solutions. Regarding net charge offs, we expect the net charge offs for 2019 will be towards the lower-end of the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase compared to 2018, driven mainly by the purchase accounting impact related to the PayPal credit portfolio, partially offset by the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio in October. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the net charge-off rate for 2019 is expected to be similar to 2018. Finally, regarding the implementation of CECL, which is effective in 2020, we believe the initial impact is consistent with what we disclosed last quarter. We will incorporate the estimated impact of CECL 's transition adjustment and impacted next year's outlook when we provide our guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. In summary, credit trends are stabilized and are showing improvement. We expect the trends to continue to show stability as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns.  Moving to Slide 12, I\u2019ll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion, an increase of $10 million or 1%, compared to last year. The increase was driven by growth or was partially offset by cost savings executed in advance of the Walmart portfolio of sale and program conversion.  Holding expenses basically flat enable us to deliver positive operating leverage for the quarter, reflecting the improvement in the efficiency ratio from 31% last year to 30.8% this quarter in-line with our expectations. Now, the sale of the Walmart portfolio, the program conversion has been completed. We do expect the final portion of the cost associated with Walmart program to be eliminated in the fourth quarter and be fully reflected in the expense run rate for 2020. Moving to Slide 13, over the last year we\u2019ve grown our deposits $3.7 billion or 6%, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 76% of our funding, compared to 72% last year. In July, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured debt. The issuance has a three-year term with a fixed rate of 2.85% and had strong demand. Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.5% under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 14.2% on a fully phased in basis last year. The CET1 level increased over the past year even as the company deployed a significant amount of capital through organic growth, program acquisitions, and continued execution of our capital plans reflecting the company's strong capital generation capabilities. During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share and repurchased $550 million or 15.6 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter, we have approximately $2.7 billion of remaining share repurchase capacity of the $4 billion board authorized plan, which runs through June 30, 2020. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities was $22 billion, which equated to 20.5% of our total assets. This is down from over 22% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support growth. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. We expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I conclude, I want to recap our current view for the fourth quarter and the year, as well as the impact from the Walmart program going forward now that the portfolio sale and conversion has been completed. Starting with the net interest margin, the margin is seasonally lower in the fourth quarter, declining as much as 50 basis points from the third to the fourth quarter in the past two years. In addition to seasonality, the decline will be somewhat more pronounced this quarter, due to the excess liquidity from the sale of the Walmart portfolio. We expect the net interest margin trend towards 15.5% for the fourth quarter. We still expect the net interest margin will be in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year. Focusing on RSA\u2019s, there are several factors impacting the RSA percent for the fourth quarter and the year. First, growth in improved program performance will impact RSA\u2019s. Also impacting RSA's is the sale of the Walmart portfolio. Specifically, both the timing of the portfolio of sale, as well as the fact of the Walmart program operated an RSA percent below the company average will have an upwards impact on the RSA percentage. Considering all these factors, we expect the RSA percent will be approximately 4.5% for the fourth quarter, and for the full-year it'll be slightly above the 4.0% to 4.2% range we had expected. Moving to credit. We expect the core reserve build for the fourth quarter to be largely driven by growth and will be in the $100 million to $150 million range. As a result of the Walmart portfolio being sold in October, the remaining reduction in the loan loss reserve held against this portfolio will occur in the fourth quarter and will be in the $35 million to $40 million range. Regarding net charge offs. We expect net charge offs for 2019 will be towards the lower end of the 5.7% to 5.9% range. The slight increase in net charge-offs were 2019, as compared to 2018 is mainly driven by the purchase accounting impact related to the PayPal credit portfolio, partially offset by the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio in October. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the net charge-off rate is expected to be similar to 2018. Turning to expenses. We continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for 2019. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive risk adjusted returns. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A. Greg Ketron : That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. I guess, first question for Brian Wenzel. Just portfolio yield, it\u2019s obviously done really well despite the fed rate cuts this quarter and I know you indicated there were some purchase impacts potentially, could we just discuss about the trend going forward, relative to all these different dynamics occurring with the rates, and obviously the mixed changes? Brian Wenzel : Great. Good morning, Sanjay. As you think about net interest margin for the quarter, a lot of our book \u2013 45% of our book is floating. When you think about transactors it's more like 25%. So, we\u2019re not necessarily as exposed to interest rates. We also think about the margin. We have a positive benefit from the purchase accounting last year for PayPal that\u2019s not reoccurring again this year, as well as the CIT that we put in place before we purchased the portfolio that\u2019s beginning to bleed in. So, those are positive impacts on the portfolio as we move forward. Obviously, with Walmart coming out of the portfolio there will be a little bit of headwind to net interest margin because that portfolio operated at a higher net interest margin than the over book. So, [again been] our assets and liabilities are fairly well matched we don\u2019t see a lot of pressure from the interest rate environment as we move forward. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And I guess my second question is for Margaret and Brian Doubles on the Synchrony MasterCard. I appreciate the disclosures there. Just want to make sure I understood what the plan was going forward with that product. Going forward, is that product just going to be used for bankruptcy transitions for retailers or are you expecting to grow that portfolio independently and then when we think about the success of that portfolio up until now, has it been consumers basically transitioning to that card as their primary card or have they been transferring balances over? Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure Sanjay. This is Brian. Look, I would say, overall, we have been pleased with the trends in the performance that we're seeing on that MasterCard portfolio, it\u2019s still early, but we're seeing good activation, good usage. We\u2019re seeing a nice retention of balances, good spend on the accounts. As you know, we put a very strong 2% cash back value proposition on the card. Given we are not paying the RSA, we\u2019re able to offer an attractive value prop and still earn a very attractive return. Look, we\u2019re pleased with what we're seeing. In terms of a broader strategy, we\u2019re certainly evaluating that. We\u2019ve got a great team in place. They\u2019ve got a lot of general-purpose card experience, you know look, we are monitoring the usage, the performance on the portfolio. We also started to do some new account originations. So, we\u2019re testing into different segments, but look I think the thing that\u2019s important to note is, we're going to be disciplined around profitability and returns on this. So, we have some modest growth expectations here in the short-term. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Hi, good morning. I had a question on the recent Venmo credit deal with PayPal. So, one of the elements of the Venmo modernization strategy for PayPal has been to enable a pay with Venmo checkout button for merchants that already accept PayPal and would like to accept Venmo. Is it reasonable to conclude that the Venmo credit product won\u2019t just act like a standalone credit card, but it will also be, you know, available digitally to Venmo customers who click on pay with Venmo checkout button? So, basically the Venmo credit is going to be integrated across the Venmo platform? Margaret Keane : You know, I would say that's probably about a question for the Venmo PayPal team, but what I can tell you is that as we work with that organization, they\u2019re really looking at how do they expand customer choice and ability for their customers. So, I would expect them to look at all avenues for growth for the use of the Venmo credit card, and, you know, we\u2019re going to work closely with them on terms of how we build out the capabilities, the digital experience, really try and understand what are the customer, you know, frictions that are out there that we want to try to solve to really have what we\u2019re describing as exclusive in-app great customer credit experience across various channels. So, we\u2019re going to work closely with them as we continue to develop both the PayPal program that we have with them as well as Venmo. Bill Carcache : Got it. Margaret, thanks. And are there any internal studies that you guys have done that give you any kind of sense of what the demand for the product will be like? It just seems like there are a lot of competing alternatives out there on the credit card side and so just wondering if it's reasonable for us to expect that the value prop will include, you know, rewards and I'm just looking for a sense of what, you know, gives you guys confidence that the demand for the product will be there? Margaret Keane : Sure. Well, you know, first, they have 40 million Venmo customers. So, we think that\u2019s a great target market and its growing. Secondly, it has a great brand and we know that, in particular millennials really love Venmo. And so, I think as we look to build out that value proposition, we\u2019re going to be looking at what are the type of rewards that those customers are looking for. So, you know, it could include cash back, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s only going to be cash back. I think we really want to get into some deep research with that customer base. And then, the other piece of this is really, as we all know, these particular or this particular segment of customers really look at experiences as a really important element of how they live and choose to live. And so, we\u2019re going to be looking at that both from a value prop perspective, as well as the experience they have themselves on using the app. Bill Carcache : That's great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Good morning. So, one question is on credit, you know, it sounds like the guide for Q4 on the reserve build is fine, but if you look at the delinquencies year-over-year ex-PayPal, they are sort of flattish from down year-over-year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectation in the near term. And then, you know, under the hood, what's going on with PayPal credit in general, I guess losses are going up just on growth and normalization, can you just talk about those two factors? Brian Wenzel : Great, great. Thanks, Don. First of all, we don't provide necessarily forward-looking guidance relative to delinquencies. They\u2019ve been consistent and stable throughout 2019. With regard to PayPal, again, we don\u2019t provide specific information on one portfolio, but when you look at the guidance, you know, we\u2019ve guided on net charge-off basis to the low-end of 5.7 to 5.9 range. So, as we move through the quarter, clearly, we've seen stabilization to improving credit trends, which is via reserve rate in the third quarter was below the guidance that we provided back in our second quarter call back in July. So, as we look at the net charge-off environment and credit environment, we\u2019re optimistic we don't see any pressure on the consumer and all the measures that we look at and our collections really have performed. So, again, we view credit to be stabilizing to better and expect the net charge-off rate for the year to be at the low end of 5.7 to 5.9 range, Don. Don Fandetti : And then, the buybacks, they were a little bit light versus our model, but, you know, they kind of bounced around. I was just curious; do you still feel like you can buy back a significant amount in the open market? Are you still considering maybe a tender? Or do you feel like you can just kind of work through that? And I would assume Q4 would be potentially heavier. Brian Wenzel : Yes, you know, obviously, you know, as we look at \u2013 as we move through the capital planning and the repurchase cadence for the year, there is a basic capital plan, a basic repurchase plan that happens over the four or five quarters that we go out. Then we had the Walmart, they kind of laid in. Obviously, you know, we had to have certainty relative to that transaction. You have to record those reserves getting into earnings. You know, we\u2019ve purchased $1.3 billion approximately for the first two quarters under the plan. We have $2.7 billion remaining under the $4 billion authorized repurchase plan. We feel confident that we will be able to execute that plan. If you go back, in our past history, we were able to execute twice, both the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year. We purchased in the open market of $966 million. So, we feel we have the execution to get to $2.7 billion done over the next three quarters. Most certainly we evaluate lots of different options to get the best execution on price, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, but we feel confident we can execute on the plan that we outlined. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Margaret Keane : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple questions, one just on the health CareCredit. Gentlemen I know you called out dental and veterinary, but I just wanted to understand a little bit more and some of the verticals there, as well as plans to, you know, continue your dominance in that field. I see a lot of interest from other \u2013 you know, either fintechies or, you know, financials coming after the area, so if you give us a sense of how you\u2019re pushing back against that competition? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Sure. So, you know, we\u2019ve said since the beginning of the year, one of our strategies was really to grow the CareCredit platform. So, in the core business itself we continue to see really good growth, and that's really the dental and vet businesses that we highlighted this quarter. But as we look to expand into more of what we\u2019re calling a health and wellness card, you know, we've expanded the utility of the card over the year to latest being the Walgreens\u2019 acceptance, and we\u2019ll continue to look at those. But our other strategy is really in two areas. One, is really shifting from what we're calling [vets to pets]. So, the acquisition of Pets Best this year is a function of that and really looking at ways to leverage both the insurance side of settlement in our card product to really ensure that the consumers are getting a really efficient process going forward as they pay their vet bills. The other part of this is really going after, when I call, payment management systems where we can integrate into those system and have care credit as an option in that system. So, the Loyale example is one of those. And then, lastly is, really expanding into what we\u2019re calling health network, so hospital network. So, I think in the past we\u2019ve describe we've gone out and sold dentist office by dentist office, vet office by vet office. We continue to look at various verticals where we think our card can be used and are now working with hospital networks to integrate CareCredit as a payment option in the hospital network. So, you know, our view is, we have a lot of expertise and experience in this space. We\u2019ve been at it for over 30 years, and we think this is a great growth opportunity for us. And, you know, while fintechs are there, we see them, we\u2019re still very confident in our capabilities and what we\u2019ve built out and where we want to go. Operator : Betsy, do you have anything further? Betsy Graseck : Oh! Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks so much. On RSAs, it\u2019s just a separate question; I know you gave us a sense of 4Q and what the outlook is for that. Could you just give us a sense of how we should anticipate it projecting, you know, a little bit longer term? I'm just basically looking for ex-Wal-Mart, should the 4Q run rate be something that, you know, seasonally it differs, you know, obviously, but should that be a good run rate that we should take for the 2020 outlook? Or is there anything else that we should be considering in that? Brian Wenzel : Great. Thanks, Betsy. You know we\u2019ll provide guidance on RSAs in our call in January encompassing full guidance for the year when we think about all the other elements. As you think about Walmart, Walmart did operate at a lower RSA percentage than the company average, which is why we see it, you know, slightly up in the fourth quarter versus past seasonal trends. Obviously, that will impact us as we move forward into 2020, but we\u2019ll provide that guidance in January. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question \u2013 we have our next question from Bill Ryan with Compass Point. Bill Ryan : Thank you and good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Also just in relation to the RSA, I know you\u2019re not providing 2020 guidance, but just as you kind of think about it structurally and directionally going into next year, do you expect it to be driven \u2013 you know you mentioned how Walmart\u2019s going to impact it, but, you know, looking at your contract renewals earlier this year, will they have any impact directionally in 2020? Or, you know, given the economics of the renewals, is it pretty much the same and is this called a nominal influence next year? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Bill, for the question. So, as you think about the RSA, when we renewed transactions, the economic formula is kind of set at the store. So, those formulas don't change as we move forward. So, really what\u2019s going to drive the RSA as we move forward absent the Walmart portfolio is really good to be the underlying performance of the portfolio from growth, from net interest margin, charge-offs etcetera. That\u2019s going to be the bigger drivers as we move forward. To the extent that we have, you know, improved performance on those lines, there will be more RSAs, to the extent it\u2019s going to be less, then the RSAs will decrease. So, that's the benefit to us as a company have that RSA buffer, but they participate in both sides. So, again, the contracts are generally set and won\u2019t change. It\u2019s really just a performance and growth of the underlying portfolios. Bill Ryan : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just want to talk about the general purpose a little bit. Historically, part of the value proposition on private label to the retailers is that you are providing their customers with spending money that they can use exclusively in their stores, and I assume that that\u2019s part of the, sort of, pitch to retailers. I\u2019m curious as you sort of dip your toe into \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to overstate the general-purpose proposition, but as you dip your toe in there, how do you think that will resonate with your existing retail partners? Brian Doubles : Yes, thanks, Rick. Look we don't see it as a competing product. If you think about who we\u2019re in there competing against, they all have general purpose card portfolio that are much more substantial than what we have here. You know, while we like this as a product and it does give us some nice diversification; it\u2019s pretty small today; we\u2019re in the very early innings here. There's a lot of positives I think in terms of what we\u2019ve rolled out. We like the trend that we\u2019re seeing on the new account originations that we've done so far, but, you know, look, this is still a small piece of the overall portfolio. We\u2019re still a partner-led business. That'll remain the case for the foreseeable future. Rick Shane : Okay, great. Thanks Brian. Brian Doubles : Yes. Operator : And thank you. We have our next question from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you're not providing any 2020 guidance yet, but I was hoping you could potentially give us a little bit more insights around the planning ahead of the seasonal implementation? So, I know we know the 50% to 60% initial build, but maybe just kind of the knock-on effects or any following impacts as far as, you know, the ongoing provisioning needs and/or sort of capital level/buyback capability once we get through the remaining 2.7 billion on the current authorization? Just any thoughts there will be helpful. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, great. You know first with regard to CECL again, we indicated on the call earlier that, you know, our expectation now is consistent with the second quarter and the range we provided back then. You know as we think about the ultimate amount that will get posted at the end of the year, that's really going to depend upon the asset composition, the economy and our kind of view that economy as it moves forward. So, there are some moving pieces and as well as we\u2019re finalizing some of the assumptions. So, it\u2019s a little bit premature to talk about the seasonal impact as well, you know, there is going to be an RSA offset, not for the day one transition adjustment, for day two. We\u2019re still working through that with our partner. So, as we finalize that here in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll provide, you know, comprehensive guidance with regard to that in January. With regard to your second part of your question with [CECL] impact capital, you know, first I\u2019d say again, it does not impact our capital plan that runs through June 30, 2020. We incorporated our view of that with our submission to the regulators back in the first quarter. So, from the [first plan] perspective, it's already addressed. You know as we think about [CECL] and the post up of the incremental reserves, we obviously have been in contact and in discussion with our regulators and stakeholders the fact that we should be getting capital credit for the post up of those reserves as we move forward and we\u2019re in ongoing dialogues on how that should occur. So, it's a little bit premature to talk about that relative to future capital plans, but we plan to incorporate it as we move forward, and will you give guidance when we have greater clarity. Matthew O'Neill : That makes a lot of sense. Thanks. And you kind of front ran my follow-up, which was going to be around the discrete contracts and the RSA structure. With respect to CECL, it sounds like that will require kind of a discussion, at least with some, if not all, of the main partners. Is that safe to say? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Obviously, we're in discussions with them. First of all, educating them on the CECL standard, make sure they understand it. And as we finalize our adjustment, how that impact then flows through the RSA structures. Again, I think we've said in the past that day one transition adjustment, there will be no impact from an RSA perspective. I mean, it does not go through the P&L. But as we move to day two, we are going through and really working with the partners, explaining the implications to them, and then we'll come back with \u2013 again, in January, with the complete guidance, with how it impacts RSA, as well as the provision line. Matthew O'Neill: All right. Great. Thanks. We will wait till then. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hi. Thank so much for taking my questions. When we just think about the general-purpose card initiatives and given your efficiency has been pretty stable for quite some time, should we expect some of the initiatives on \u2013 for general-purpose buildout, if there is any to pressure the efficiency ratio as we look forward in any way? Or is this just part of \u2013 is this so small and part of your kind of normal investment builds when you think about it moving forward anyway that it shouldn't have any material impact on your efficiency ratio moving forward? Brian Doubles : Yes. I don't think in the short term, certainly, you're going to see this pressure, the efficiency ratio at all, I think. Just going back, one important thing I said earlier. We're testing into new account originations, we're testing into different customer segments, different APRs, etcetera, but it's very important to note that we're going to be very disciplined around profitability and returns. So, we're being very disciplined here in the short-term as we run new tabs, we're trying to find those sales where we can, one, where we can compete. It's obviously a very competitive market. We're trying to find those areas where we can compete, but still earn a very attractive return. So, that's our primary focus here. Dominick Gabriele : Yes. Sounds like a great run rate for expansion. And then just separately, can you talk about the Retail Card segment exposure to home improvement outside of Lowe's when you think about the total Retail Card NII and fees? And then we've seen a spike in mortgage applications. Can you talk about what you've seen in the past, even pre-IPO of your spending trends as mortgage applications ramp, it seems like there is a really good opportunity that's unique to Synchrony right now unfolding, where you may see some accelerated NII growth in the future due to some of this home improvement possible ramp from mortgage applications. Can you just talk about the pre-IPO trends you've seen and some of the [indiscernible]? Margaret Keane : Sure. So, I would say that \u2013 obviously, we have Lowe's, which is a big retailer related to the home. But our Payment Solutions business is really where the verticals are really dedicated to a lot of the home, particularly furniture, home improvement, HVAC, all those types of things. And I think you've seen us talk about the fact that home has definitely helped us I would say over the last probably 18 months, and we're seeing people invest in their home. So, we're seeing that on the Payment Solutions side, for sure, and in loans. I think the other thing we did this year is, we launched the HOME Network, which is a card that allows you to purchase in a number of our retail partners and others. It's a network card, particularly dedicated to purchasing a home, which \u2013 the launch was very good. We're continuing to invest in that network. So, to your point, we see the home as a critical element of growth as we look forward in this business and feel that we have a number of merchants across the system that are particularly dedicated to that vertical. So, definitely a nice opportunity for us as we see home purchasing increase and home improvement being a big part of that. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Maybe just getting back to the PayPal-Venmo relationship. One phenomenon that I'm sure you guys have also noticed is the growing use of buy-now, pay-later functionality, which in many ways is similar to what you do on promotional finance. So, I'm wondering if there is any discussion that you are having about maybe integrating those functionalities and capabilities into your relationship with PayPal? Margaret Keane : So, we actually have a product out there already called SetPay that we've tested a pilot in the market. That is a product like that. What I would say is, from a PayPal and Venmo perspective, first of all, they are obviously a very customer focused, digitally focused organization, and I would say they look at all opportunities as a way to grow their business, which is a benefit to us growing our business. So, we're in talks with them on a bunch of different things, both on the PayPal side \u2013 I'd like to remind everyone we only converted PayPal in June. So, just on the pure PayPal side, we have a list of initiatives that we want to work on and execute on, particularly from a growth, marketing, product design perspective going forward. And now we have the added opportunity of Venmo. So, I would say the teams are looking at all different types of ways to really leverage the opportunity that's out there in the marketplace and really make sure we have the right offer for the right product in front of the customer as they're making their purchases. And that would all be in-app and digital. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. And if I can just follow up \u2013 and I know there's been a series of questions on this already, but just with respect to the general purpose product that you're experimenting with, what \u2013 maybe just at a high level, what is the thesis there that you're pursuing given, as I think others have pointed out, it's a reasonably crowded marketplace, particularly in cash back where there has been an acceleration towards the 2% level and such, but as Apple Card and others kind of demonstrate, in and of itself does not really might \u2013 driving consumers to adoption? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, first I'd say this is a very close adjacency to what we do today in our core business. We have very experienced underwriting credit teams, very experienced marketing teams. We have had a dual card product, which is a top of wallet general purpose card like product for years. So, this is a space we actually know really well. We actually have a great team in place that has a lot of general-purpose card expertise. And this is \u2013 part of the strategy is merging kind of practical reality with future long-term objectives. And when we have the opportunity to convert the Toys R Us portfolio, that was a great way to kind of maintain utility for those cardholders, give them an attractive value proposition, and has frankly provided us with a great test bed now to kind of learn and see how we want to enter into the space. It's been on our strategic roadmap for years. I think the conversion allowed us to accelerate that. And we're pretty excited. But we're also cautious. We're not confused that this is a very competitive market. We're very focused on targeting profitable accounts that have a good risk adjusted return. And so, we're \u2013 I would say, our growth expectations in the short-term are modest, but we're excited about getting some nice diversification, but laser-like focused on maintaining our return profile as well. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Operator : And thank you. Our last question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But picking up on your comments, Margaret, on PayPal Credit, could you talk a little bit about maybe the priorities as you go forward? Because it is really \u2013 I mean, it's sort of greenfield in terms of allowing you kind of the ability to access retailers \u2013 either deeper penetrate retailers that are your partners or retailers that aren't, and maybe how we should think about the opportunities and how you're going to prioritize them? Margaret Keane : I think the opportunities are in a couple of key areas. One is just pure marketing. In the past, we were kind of on the PayPal side competing because they had their product, we had our product. So, I think from a merge on how we're kind of targeting customers, I think that's a real opportunity. The second thing that I think has been \u2013 has proven to be very beneficial is the sharing of data on both sides, meaning, we have a lot of information, they have a lot of information, so how do we leverage that information, both from a growth perspective, which I think is the most exciting part, but then also making sure from an underwriting perspective we're making the right decisions and, more importantly, is protecting on the fraud side. So, we see lots of opportunity to just be \u2013 what I would say, more efficient on the marketing side, and then more robust on the credit underwriting and protecting the consumer. I think we are still in early days as we\u2019ve laid out the conversion, which was as you know a big one. We have a bunch of what I would call technological advances that we\u2019re going to make together that we\u2019re really driving and that\u2019s really going to be more around the customer and merchant experience. Really trying to make that as seamless as possible and ensure that customer never leaves the PayPal App if you will and it\u2019s all done within the App and so we have teams of people, and I mean teams working on a bunch of initiatives to really drive all of that. And it\u2019s all around what I would say two key things, growth and experience, both on the consumer side and the merchant side, which is very important here for PayPal. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. And kind of in a similar vein, you talked a little bit about some of the health care and pet-type networks. Is there any thought given to kind of talking about these in terms of the networks that you\u2019ve kind of built yourself as a vertical that you would give disclosure on because I think, you know one of the things that I heard during the call was this idea that there is some concern about incursion by fintechs and when \u2013 sort of it seems like the opposite that you have the ability to build those networks and so whether that\u2019s something you think about kind of outlining in greater detail? Margaret Keane : Yes. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll probably look at as we talk about the strategy for 2020 going forward, but generally speaking, you know, we have, first of all we have, first of all I would say, the space itself is fairly fragmented right. So, one of the advantages we have is just the fact that we have created a brand name for ourselves and are recognized by a lot of folks in that space, but we are still, honestly I would say we're still learning, particularly on the big hospital network side, each of these networks operate very differently. And I think you know that we brought on our board an expert in this area who is helping us think through how to target and where to go after. So, we\u2019ll talk more about that as we go into 2020. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks so much. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 2019 marked another year of significant transformation for Synchrony. Across all of our sales platforms, we renewed more than 50 existing partnerships, while also signing 30 new business deals. We expanded our CareCredit card network and our auto and home networks. We significantly enhanced the digital experience for cardholders and substantially grew our direct-to-consumer deposit platform.  During our five years as a public company, we have made significant investments in people and technology, and that has propelled the company forward and enabled the development of innovative offerings for our partners and enhanced our capabilities and user experiences for our cardholders.  In the fourth quarter, earnings were $731 million or $1.15 per diluted share, which included the remaining reduction in the reserve related to the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in October. The reduction totaled $38 million or $28 million aftertax and provided an EPS benefit of $0.05 to the quarter, as outlined in Slide 3 of the presentation. Loan receivables were down 6%. However, on a core basis, which excludes Walmart and the Yamaha portfolio that we moved to loans held for sale in the fourth quarter, loan receivables were up 5%. On a core basis, the loan receivable growth drove 5% growth in interest and fees. Purchase volume was up 7% and average active accounts increased 3%.  The efficiency ratio was 34.8%, including a restructuring charge of $21 million for employee costs, which had a 60 basis point impact on the efficiency ratio this quarter, as we continue to drive cost efficiency for the company. We grew deposits $1.1 billion or 2% over last year, and much of this growth has come through direct deposits, which grew 10%. Our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth, and we continue to invest in our bank to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers. While organic growth continues to present the largest opportunity for us, and we have demonstrated our ability to not only grow our existing programs, but also launch new programs with fast-growing partners in new markets.  In our Retail Card sales platform, we announced a new partnership with Verizon, where we will be the exclusive issuer of Verizon's co-branded consumer credit card. Together, we are launching the first credit card designed specifically for Verizon's customers. We are thrilled to be working with Verizon, as they continue to bring innovation to their customers, and this is a great growth opportunity for us, as we continue to diversify our portfolio. The new Verizon credit card is expected to launch during the first half of this year. We established new payment solution relationships with Mor Furniture for Less, Grand Home Furnishings, Travis Industries and Leisure Pro; and renewed key relationships with Rooms To Go, BuyMax Alliance, CFMOTO and Continental Tires.  We remain focused on growing our network to create broader acceptance and utility for our cards, and we have had many recent successes on that front in our CareCredit network. In the fourth quarter, CareCredit established a new relationship with Kaiser Permanente. We've been focused on adding health systems to our CareCredit network, and with the addition of Kaiser Permanente, we now have five health systems under contract. During the quarter, we also renewed a key CareCredit relationship with Demant, a global market leader in hearing health.  We continue to remain highly focused on digital innovation, accelerating our data analytics capabilities and creating frictionless customer experiences, which are key to the success of our programs and winning new partnerships. Driving digital sales penetration is key to our success.  In Retail Card, digital sales penetration was 39% in the fourth quarter. We are happy to report that we have reached a new high on digital applications, which were 52% of our total applications in the fourth quarter. The mobile channel alone grew over 40% compared to the same quarter last year, excluding Walmart. Our capital allocation strategy drives strong growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and the ability to return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.4 billion of Synchrony Financial common stock and paid $141 million in dividends.  We concluded 2019 having made significant advances in our capabilities and winning key partnerships that will generate long-term value for the company. We have a clear vision for our future and what we need to do to get there. Later in the call, Brian Doubles will outline our strategic priorities as we move into 2020. I will take a moment to highlight our platform results on Slide 4. In Retail Card, loans were down 12%, but increased 4% on a core basis, with solid growth, driven by our digital partners. Other metrics were down, driven by the sale of the Walmart portfolio. We are excited about our new partnership with Verizon, in addition to the other partnerships we announced in 2019, and look forward to launching these new programs this year.  Payment Solutions delivered a strong quarter with broad-based growth across the sales platform, and particular strength in home furnishings and home specialty, that resulted in loan receivables growth of 4% or 7% on a core basis. Interest and fees on loans increased 4%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 6%, and average active accounts increased 3%. We signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter. We continued to drive growth organically through our partnerships and card networks. These networks, along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 31% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas, have helped to drive solid results and position the Payment Solutions platform for future growth.  CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 8% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 12%, and average active accounts increased 5%. We continued to expand our network and the utility of our card, most recently through our partnership with Kaiser Permanente, which helped to drive the reuse rate to 54% of purchase volume in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year, we drove strong growth across our sales platforms. We extended and expanded relationships, signed exciting new partnerships, launched new programs, increased the utility of our cards and networks and grew our Payment Solutions platform to over $20 billion and our CareCredit network to over $10 billion in receivables. Our efforts and achievements provide a strong foundation for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel to review our financial performance for the quarter and year and our outlook for 2020. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Margaret, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $731 million or $1.15 per diluted share. This included the remaining reduction in the reserve related to the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in October. As Margaret noted earlier, the reduction totaled $38 million or $28 million aftertax and provided an EPS benefit of $0.05 to the quarter.  We generated solid year-over-year growth in several areas, as noted on Slide 6. Excluding Walmart and the Yamaha portfolio, which was moved to loans held for sale in the fourth quarter, loan receivables were up 5% on a core basis. Interest and fees on loan receivables were also up 5% on a core basis over last year, driven by the growth in receivables. On a core basis, purchase volume growth was 7%, and average active accounts increased 3% over last year. Overall, we're pleased with the underlying growth we generated across the business as well as the risk-adjusted returns on this growth.  RSAs increased $174 million or 20% from last year. Improved program performance and growth primarily drove the increase. The increase also included the RSA impact, resulting from the $17 million release of reserves due to the reclassification of loan receivables to held for sale for Yamaha. RSAs as a percent of average receivables was 4.8% for the quarter. The RSA percent was impacted by the sale of the Walmart portfolio, which operated an RSA percent below the company average, in addition to the factors driving the increase in RSAs.  The provision for loan losses decreased $348 million or 24% from last year. The reduction was mainly driven by the lower core reserve build and a reduction in net charge-offs. The core reserve build for the fourth quarter was $50 million. Other income increased $40 million over last year mainly due to lower loyalty costs, as a result of the Walmart program conversion. Other expenses were basically flat to last year, but included a restructuring charge of $21 million included in employee costs. So overall, the company continued to generate solid results in the fourth quarter.  I'll move to Slide 7 to cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 7% from last year, primarily driven by a 6% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the Walmart portfolio. On a core basis, interest and fees on loan receivables increased 5%. The net interest margin was 15.01% compared to last year's margin of 16.06%. The main factors driving the margin performance were : a decline in loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets, the mix declined from 83.5% to 80.2%, driven by holding excess liquidity of approximately $3 billion resulting from the proceeds of the sales of the Walmart portfolio; a 33 basis point decrease in the loan receivables yield to 20.87%, primarily driven by the sale of the Walmart portfolio; and a 10 basis point increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost to 2.58%, primarily due to the higher benchmark rates. Later in the call, I'll provide more insight on the direction of net interest margin for 2020, including the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio.  Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with our delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.44% compared to 4.76% last year, and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.15% compared to 2.29% last year. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal Credit program and the Walmart portfolio, the 30-plus delinquency rate and the 90-plus delinquency rate were flat compared to the last year, reflecting continued stable credit trends.  Focusing on net charge-off trends. The net charge-off rate was 5.15% compared to 5.54% last year. The reduction in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by Walmart and improving credit trends. This was partially offset by the purchase accounting impact in 2018 related to the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the impact of the PayPal Credit program and the Walmart portfolio, the net charge-off rate was approximately 15 basis points lower than last year.  The allowance for loan losses as a percent of loan receivables was 6.42%. The core reserve build in the fourth quarter was $50 million, excluding the impact of the final reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart portfolio, which was $38 million; and a release of the reserves of $17 million for the Yamaha portfolio, which was reclassified to held for sale in the fourth quarter. The Yamaha release had no impact on net earnings due to the RSA offset, I discussed earlier. In summary, the core credit trends have leveled off and are slightly better than our expectations. We expect the core trends to show stability as we move forward, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Later, I will provide an outlook on credit expectations for the year, including the impact of adopting CECL.  Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion, basically flat compared to last year. This includes a restructuring charge of $21 million, included in employee cost in the fourth quarter. While we did see an increase in expenses driven by growth, this was offset by cost reductions from Walmart. We achieved our cost reductions goal for Walmart, and those cost reductions will be in the expense run rate for 2020. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter increased to 34.8%. The increase was primarily driven by Walmart, which operated at a lower efficiency ratio than the company average; higher RSAS, including the impact from the Yamaha portfolio; and also included the restructuring charge.  Moving to Slide 10. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits $1.1 billion or 2%. This puts deposits at 77% of our funding compared to 73% last year. While we slowed overall deposit growth in the second half of 2019 in anticipation of the proceeds from the Walmart sale, we did continue to grow lower-cost direct deposits at a strong 10% pace in the fourth quarter. Focusing on capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.1% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules, a slight increase over last year. In November, we completed our first preferred stock issuance, totaling $750 million at a fixed rate of 5.625%. The issuance had strong demand and was significantly oversubscribed. During the quarter, we continue to execute on our capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share and repurchased $1.4 billion or 38.4 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, we have approximately $1.3 billion of remaining share repurchase capacity of the $4 billion board authorized plan, which runs through June 30, 2020.  Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.4 billion, which equated to 22.3% of our total assets. This is up from 18% last year, reflecting the approximate $3 billion of excess liquidity we're holding from the proceeds from the sale of the Walmart portfolio.  Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We're committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet, with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. We expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  Next, on Slide 11, I'll recap our 2019 performance compared to the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our core growth of 5% was in line with our outlook range of 5% to 7%. Organic growth remained the primary driver of the solid results. Strong value props on our cards, effective marketing strategies, continued investments in technology, digital assets and data analytic capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs. We continue to see strong growth of 7% to 8% in our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms.  Net interest margin was 15.78% for the year, in line with the 15.75% to 16% range we expected. We did see the margin impact resulting from the sale of the Walmart portfolio in the fourth quarter and the impact will continue into 2020, which I will cover in our 2020 outlook. RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in higher than our outlook last January. RSAs were 4.4% for the year compared to our outlook of 4.0% to 4.2%. The higher RSA percent was mainly driven by improved program and credit performance in 2019 and included the RSA impact resulting from the release of reserves related to Yamaha.  Our net charge-off rate of 5.6% was below our 5.7% to 5.9% outlook range for the year. Credit trends moderately improved in 2019, slightly better than our expectations. The sale of the Walmart portfolio also had a positive impact on the net charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, and that will continue into 2020. The efficiency ratio for the year was 31.9%, slightly above our expectations. This was mainly due to higher RSAs that resulted from improved program and credit performance during 2019 and also included the restructuring charge we recognized during the fourth quarter. Finally, excluding the impact of the reductions in the Walmart reserve, we generated a return on assets of 2.7% versus our expectations of approximately 2.5%.  On Slide 12, I'll recap the estimated impact of adopting CECL. The adoption of CECL was effective on January 1. So no impact on 2019. The initial adjustment is recorded to retain earnings and does not impact net earnings or EPS. The initial impact on the allowance for loan losses from the adoption of CECL on January 1, was an increase of approximately $3 billion or 54% of the year-end balance, in line with our expectations. The reduction to retained earnings from the after-tax impact is approximately $2.3 billion as well as creating a deferred tax asset of approximately $700 million. On a regulatory basis, we elected to phase-in the approximate $2.3 billion impact on a capital at 25% per year in each year from 2020 to 2023. On a CET1 transition basis, this will impact the ratio by approximately 60 basis points per year during the phase-in period.  We want to continue to emphasize our view that CECL is an accounting versus an economic change. CECL does not affect the cash flows generated by the company, how we view the lifetime value of an account, or the IRR of marketing investments. We are providing the 2020 outlook, which includes the anticipated impact of CECL. And have highlighted those specific measures where we expect to see the impact from CECL to provide comparability on how our expectations align with 2019. Beginning with the first quarter, we expect to provide similar visibility to help with comparison to the prior year where the historical loss method was utilized.  Moving on to our 2020 outlook on Slide 13. Our macro assumptions for 2020 includes stable key benchmark and unemployment rates throughout the year. Our outlook for receivables growth is in the 5% to 7% range. As Margaret noted, we have new programs such as Venmo and Verizon, that'll be launching throughout the year. As a result, we expect receivables growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.  We expect the purchase volume will run at our historical rate of 2 to 3x broader retail sales. And for online and mobile to continue its strong growth. We believe our net interest margin will run in the 15.25% to 15.50% range for the year, lower than where margin has run historically, at normal seasonality we see quarter-to-quarter. One factor driving the lower margin expectation is the excess liquidity of approximately $3 billion that we will be carrying on our balance sheet from the proceeds of the Walmart sale. We expect the excess liquidity will be deployed through growth, as the year progresses. However, it will impact our margin by an estimated 20 basis points in 2020. The other factor is the impact of not having the higher yields the Walmart portfolio contributed.  Regarding the net interest margin performance throughout the year, we expect it to run closer to 15% in the first half of the year, then trend back closer to the 15.50% during the second half of the year as we deploy the excess liquidity. We expect that RSAs as a percent of average receivables will be in the 4.3% to 4.5% range for 2020. The single largest driver of the expected increase in the RSA outlook is the sale of the Walmart portfolio, which operated at a lower RSA percent than our overall rate. The outlook is more in line with our historical run rate and reflects continued strong performance of our programs.  While there will be no RSA offset on the initial CECL adjustment to reserves, the ongoing impact of CECL will be included in the RSA, which will provide a partial offset to the reserve increase. That offset is muted in the first half of 2020 and then more fully realized in the second half of the year, in accordance with the calculations of the RSA and our program agreements.  In terms of credit, we expect the net charge-off rate for 2020 will be in the 5.4% to 5.6% range versus the 5.6% in 2019. The sale of the Walmart portfolio has a positive impact on the net charge-off rate. Regarding loan loss reserve builds, we expect the total reserve build for the year under CECL will be in the $800 million to $900 million range versus $500 million to $600 million if we continue reserving under the same methodology as 2019. This represents approximately a $300 million increase in reserve provisioning due to the implementation of CECL. There are factors that can impact these ranges, such as changes in economic trends, consumer behavior, portfolio and product mix and the underlying assumptions used in determining the allowance for loan losses.  We expect to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 32%, in line with 2019. Also impacting the efficiency ratio will be the technology and people investments necessary to launch the new programs we have noted. These are upfront investments we must make to broaden our capabilities and build the infrastructure around the programs ahead of the actual launch. The total estimated impact on 2020 EPS from launching these programs is approximately $0.20 of EPS dilution, which includes investments ahead of the launch, operating costs and reserves related to the growth of these new programs. While starting up these programs has a dilutive effect on EPS in 2020, we're excited about the future potential they provide. The preferred stock dividends will start this year and will be paid quarterly beginning in mid-February. The dividends for the full year will amount to $42 million or a $0.07 reduction in EPS. Finally, consistent with our track record, excluding the impact of CECL, we expect to generate a return on assets of approximately 2.5% in 2020, which includes the dilution related to launching the new programs. As part of this outlook, I want to provide a view on certain key earnings drivers for the first quarter. We expect the net interest margin to remain near 15% in the first quarter due to the factors I noted previously. Typically, we see the net charge-off rate trends seasonally higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the seasonal decline in receivables. The increase has historically been in the range of 50 basis points, and we expect the trend in the first quarter to be similar. We expect that RSAs, as a percent of average receivables will be in the 4.4% to 4.6% range, with and without CECL impact.  Regarding reserve builds. We expect the build to be $75 million to $100 million with CECL and $50 million to $75 million excluding the impact of CECL. We expect the efficiency ratio to be approximately 33% for the first quarter, then the ratio to trend down as the year progresses. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian Doubles to highlight the strategies that will help drive future results. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a recap of our strategic priorities, which are focused on driving long-term value creation, while diversifying for the future. A top priority, as always, is the growth of our core partnerships. Opportunities to grow will continue to be evaluated through the lens of the risk-adjusted returns they produce. To strengthen our relationships, we will seek to continue to deliver innovative new products and capabilities that add value to cardholders and the programs and drive card usage and brand loyalty. We will also continue to launch new programs, where we believe the partnership can deliver the opportunity for growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. We will also seek to diversify through targeted strategies in Payment Solutions, CareCredit and our Synchrony-branded products. This will help us to achieve a more diverse revenue base through the acceleration of growth in small programs and new products.  We will focus on growing Payment Solutions through enhanced point-of-sale capabilities and innovative product offerings. In CareCredit, we will continue to work on broader acceptance and further expansion of the network with an emphasis on health systems, like our recently announced partnership with Kaiser Permanente. This is an area where we see a significant opportunity. We will also continue to invest in our Synchrony-branded products, the auto and home networks and the Synchrony Mastercard. Lastly, we will leverage our recent acquisitions to develop and grow new revenue sources in e-gifting and pets.  Technology and data analytics remain a key focus, as we strive to provide best-in-class customer experiences. We believe this customer-first approach will be an increasingly important growth driver. We will continue the expansion of advanced data analytics, leveraging customer-level performance dynamics and further develop capabilities to deliver frictionless customer experiences. We are also focused on alternative data and machine learning to further drive innovation, advanced underwriting and authentication. These investments are critical to driving growth in our existing programs as well as securing renewals and winning new programs like Venmo and Verizon.  It remains a key priority to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We have proven our ability to do this, and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. Finally, we will continue to utilize our strong capital position to support growth, launch new programs, invest in products and capabilities and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  We believe we are well positioned for long-term growth, and we look forward to driving results for our partners, cardholders and shareholders in 2020 and beyond.  I will now turn it over to Greg to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Gregory Ketron : That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So I wanted to start off with a question on the net interest margin. So it had been running in the, call it, 15.75% to 16% range since you went public and deployed all your liquidity. Now just to think about the moving pieces, you're saying 15% for the first quarter, which means you need to be 15.5% plus for the rest of the year to reach the middle of the guide. So I know it's hard to forecast very far out given all the moving pieces, but should we think about 15.50% plus as a more normal margin range, once we get beyond this liquidity impact? And then second, are there any other levers, particularly on the funding side, you could have to drive this back closer to that historical range? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So yes, we're trending towards the 15% in the front half of the year, really as we work through the $3 billion of excess liquidity we have from Walmart coming off the fourth quarter. We obviously are trying to work the funding profile and manage that to deploy that liquidity as fast as possible, including through organic growth, really in the first couple of quarters of 2020. As we guided, the back half of the year should trend towards that 15.5%. So when you think about it, year-over-year, there's really the 2 major impacts, right? The first one is burning off this excess liquidity. The second is the impact of the Walmart portfolio, which operated at a higher margin than the company average and other portfolios. So obviously, Walmart was out for a part of the fourth quarter. So when you have those events, we should trend back towards that 15.5% in the back part of the year. Ryan Nash : Okay, got it. And maybe just to squeeze in a question on costs. So I thought I heard you say that you achieved all of the Walmart cost savings in the run rate. I just wanted to double check if that was the case? And can you maybe just help us understand the moving pieces on the expense growth going forward. I know Brian Doubles talked about some of them. But Margaret, maybe you could expand on what are some of the big strategic investments that you're making? And would you view this as a year of accelerating cost growth, and we could potentially get back to something lower beyond this year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So I'll hand the first part and then give it over to Margaret. So as you think about the cost, again, we're guiding to approximately 32%, which is just 20 basis points higher than the full year average of 31.8%. Yes, we did get the cost reductions that we anticipated for Walmart out and they'll be fully baked into the run rate as we move forward. The impact slightly on the efficiency ratio, again, is Walmart-related because of the high revenue that came off of that portfolio and what it's generated, it ran a much lower efficiency ratio as a portfolio than the company average. So that's the slight tick up that you'll see there. Margaret Keane : Yes. And I think, Ryan, on investments, it's really a couple of things. So first is really the investment we're making in Venmo and Verizon. Both of these programs are going to really be fully digitized in-app experiences. And so we've added a number of agile teams to really develop a number of APIs to really deliver for those partners. We have the launch on. We have people that we need to add. So those are really a big part of the strategic initiative in terms of those two programs. More broadly, we're continuing to invest in a couple of key areas. We talked a little bit about CareCredit. We're adding resources and technology enhancements there, particularly as we go into health systems, which we believe is a really great investment and one where we'll get a great return over time. And just broadly, I would say, from a technology perspective, we continue on this journey of really driving digitization and frictionless customer experiences. I'd say the other area we're very focused on is really what I would call the customer journey.  So I think we've done a really good job on the front end, meaning how you apply and buy and using your mobile capabilities. But we're really looking at how do we get more efficiency out of our back office, in terms of using digitization to really excel that experience for the customer. So it is a bit of investment. I think the biggest kind of add to the year is really, though, the Verizon and Venmo investment we're making. And in our mind, those are two great opportunities for us for future growth. And we think that, that investment is really going to be the right investments to make for the company. Ryan Nash : Got it. And thanks for all the color on CECL. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : I was hoping that -- and I kind of hate to ask a question like this kind of precise, but you did $4.03 billion of net interest income in the fourth quarter. Usually, you have a little bit of a seasonal decline in Q1 and then start growing. Given that you do expect the margin to be higher and assets to grow and Walmart was almost entirely out of Q4, is it reasonable that other than normal seasonal impacts that we should expect to see growth in NII from the Q4 level? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Moshe. Yes, as you think about the fourth quarter, Walmart was in for approximately, call it, 15, 20 days. So that impact, when you think about the quarter, there will be a slight dilution as it relates to that. And then really, it's the excess liquidity, that we're carrying in that's impacting along with normal seasonality, when you think sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Moshe Orenbuch : Right. But that excess liquidity isn't impacting dollars of net interest income in a material way, right? Brian Wenzel : Yes, it's also impact -- yes, it is impacting on dollars. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Second question, just on the expenses. You talked about the charge and then -- that was in the Q4 and then some investments. Maybe just -- because you did say that you're going to have an improvement over time kind of back on the efficiency side, maybe just -- can you talk a little bit about the approach that you're taking to those investments. How you would see them paying back over what period of time. And how we should think about that? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So if you think about the investments -- Margaret highlighted, so as you think about the investments in Verizon and Venmo, there's different pieces of it, right? We have to pre-stage people, right? So we have teams been up and standing up here to get these programs ready. We'll have certain launch costs, as you think about research that's done on the consumer the value proposition, et cetera, that phases in. As Margaret talked about, we're then standing up the IT and infrastructure. These are sizable opportunities. And we need to be at full scale relative to the launches, both Verizon in the first half and Venmo in the second half. And given the nature of these two opportunities, there are specific things around data lake, around how we're doing digital servicing, as Margaret talked about, API. So that cost builds up, right, as we move through the year. So that piece is the incremental.  We run with, hopefully, a very good cost discipline in the business. We got the cost reduction we wanted from Walmart. We're continuing to try to drive out and drive efficiencies in the business and the processes, whether it sits in the enterprise operations side or across all our core functions. And we look at the business from multiple different lenses and how we manage expenses, and we'll be fairly disciplined as we move through 2020. Operator : Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Appreciate all the CECL commentary. So when we think about the loan growth expectations, that we have in 2020 and the growth that we saw this year. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the core portfolio is growing mid-single digits, which is lower than what we have seen in the past. Can you guys talk about sort of how that will migrate over time? Because you do have a set of more higher-growth merchants now in the portfolio. And then maybe, how -- yes, I guess, how it would migrate higher over the next several years would be the question there? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. So as you think about growth, we're projecting 5% to 7% this year. We're coming off 5% last year. If you think about from the 17% to 19% range, our average growth was 4% to 7% ex the PayPal acquisition. So we're growing in line with that. Again, Verizon and Venmo will come in, they'll phase in. Again, they're de novo programs with one launching in the first half, one launching in the second half. So we're not providing long-term guidance relative to the growth rate, but obviously, they are start-up programs, and that trajectory -- we'll obviously provide guidance, as we move into 2021. So we're inside historical norms. If you look inside the portfolio, there are moving pieces. Yes, we have some fast-growing portfolios, but we also have some pockets that are not growing as fast, as I'm sure you can recognize, and they work in concert. So again, we're comfortable with the 5% to 7% range we have this year. It's within guidance. And then clearly, we'll look at the trajectory of the new programs that we're launching this year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And I guess, two sort of data point-related follow-ups. The preferred stock issuance, what drove that? Was it just diversifying funding sources? And then the charge-off rate, the relative charge-off rate to this year's guidance, if we were to take out Walmart in 2019, do we have the metric around that, like what that charge-off rate would have been? Brian Doubles : Yes. With regard to your first question, we've talked long term about our capital strategy and really moving our capital levels, CET1, et cetera, in line with peers. Along this journey, we started out with an 18% CET1, we're down to 14% now. Part of that long-term capital strategy has been diversification to match our peers. So it was always part of the strategy, it was included in our capital plan that we filed with the regulators and it was approved by our Board earlier this year. So it was part of our diversification efforts really to lower the overall cost of equity. So it was important for us to get it done. The timing of which -- the market was very attractive. We got a 5.625% rate for the preferred, a significant amount of institutional and retail investors. So it was significantly oversubscribed. We obviously wanted to access the market and wanted to do it before 2020 and any potential disruptions that may come to the market from unforeseen events. So that's really the rationale behind why we did it. So -- and your second question was on -- just remind me. Sanjay Sakhrani : Yes. The charge off, rate? Like, do we have the equivalent of that charge-off rate ex Walmart for 2019. Brian Doubles : Yes. We're not going to provide it, Sanjay, ex Walmart. But what I'd say is this is, we gave you an indication probably 18 months ago about what that rate was. What's happened since then, obviously, the portfolio has deteriorated from $10 billion to the roughly $8.2 billion that we sold it at. As well as the fact that the credit refinements that we put in place several years ago really helped to start reducing that. So the impact this year was not as significant, right, as what we'd indicated 18 months ago. Operator : Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Can you talk a little bit more about the interplay of CECL and the RSA? I mean, just on the surface, the increase in provision seems like a pretty sizable amount, but I guess, there's an offset. Can you just talk more about that? I know you touched on it earlier. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Don. Yes. So as you think about the RSA, obviously, we've been talking to our partners for several months about that change and how it impacts the RSAs. I just want to be clear, we are passing -- for those RSAs that participate in reserves, the RSA -- the full amount of CECL will be reflected in the RSA. We did not amend any of our agreements to either exclude or reduce the amount of reserve provisioning that those agreements associated with. So I just want to be clear on that. As you think about CECL and the impact to the RSA, I think it needed to be important to ground things. The primary platform that uses RSAs is the Retail Card platform. That platform actually has a lower provisioning relative to CECL, given its products and how it interacts. The Payment Solutions and CareCredit business, given the longer duration promotional activity that happens there, actually attracts a larger CECL increase as you move through. Also impacting that, there's a slight lag that happens the way with which the calculations work, as it passes through. So again, you'll see that in the full run rate of the year, particularly in the back half of the year, as we move forward. Donald Fandetti : Okay. And then just quickly on underwriting. Are you making any changes to your underwriting right now? Or are you sort of in a steady state? And are you seeing any competitors loosen up just given the sort of better economic outlook? Margaret Keane : Yes. We have not loosened up. What I would say is we've been pretty consistent in our underwriting. Obviously, we're always making slight changes. I think one of the things we've talked about in the past is, we've done a lot of investing in how we're creating our models and the data that we're using, both externally and internally. And so I think we're much more strategic in how we look at underwriting. And that's really helped us, I think, continue to see the good performance we're seeing in delinquencies and charge-offs. So we're being pretty consistent. I think this is the time, where you want to just continue to be very consistent and possible, as you think about where we are in the cycle. Operator : We have our next question from Ryan Cary with Bank of America. Ryan Cary : I think most of the discussion around loan growth acceleration in 2020 is resulting from the new program launches like Venmo and Verizon. But could there be any benefit from PayPal as the conversion is now behind you? And has there been discussion about moving out to more of an integration phase? Or is this more likely to benefit -- is longer -- more likely to take a little bit longer term to ramp? Margaret Keane : No. I think -- look, I think PayPal is a fast-growing portfolio for us. It's performing the way we thought it would perform. I think what we talked about last year was getting the portfolio converted, which happened in June. It was a fairly big and sophisticated conversion. What we're really focused on now with the PayPal team is really looking at how we accelerate growth. I think Venmo's a little different in the sense that it's a start-up. So it will take us a little longer to get that growth going. But I'd say, overall, we're pretty pleased about the growth that we're seeing. It's the kind of growth we want to see. And I think, as we add some of these new, more digitally driven partners, you'll -- that'll continue to play into our portfolio. I do want to make one point that despite maybe some of the retails struggling a little more, one of the things I think we're definitely winning on is on the mobile side, and we're definitely seeing growth in mobile. And I think, as we went through holiday, that was a big part of our win, I think, with our partners, and our partners are continuing to depend on us to really deliver capability to them to really drive growth digitally. So I think that's something that we're going to continue to focus on as well. Brian Wenzel : Yes, let me just maybe just add one point of clarity. As you think about the primary amount of the growth for the year, when you think about the 5% to 7%, is coming off the existing book. So while we're launching Verizon and Venmo, given the timing of it during the first half and second half, when you're thinking about that growth in end of period, it's not going to be a big movement this year. It's something, as we think about in future years, that's going to be an accelerator. So just to make sure, we're clear that the existing portfolio is driving that growth. Ryan Cary : Okay, okay. And just wanted to ask one on the GPR card. I think you've guided a number of direct mailings in the quarter. I'm just curious about the resulting adoption and uptake and how that compared to your expectations? Do you expect to accelerate direct marketing on the GPR card for next year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So look, we continue to see really good trends on the card. I'd say they're generally better than our expectations on both of the campaigns that we've done. We're seeing good activation, good usage, nice retention of the balances. But as I said last quarter, we're being very disciplined around profitability and returns. So -- and then short term, we've got modest growth expectations. We're being very thoughtful. Look, we realize it's a very competitive market, and we're trying to target profitable accounts. So we really -- we like the space, we like what we're seeing so far, but we're going to be disciplined on how we approach this. Operator : We have our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to dig in a little bit on RSA and just to make sure I understand. I know you gave the range for the full year, 4.3 to 4.5, but then you talked about how beginning of the year it'll be lower and then end of the year it'll be higher. Is that within the range that you're identifying? Or is this range the average for the full year and the quarterlies could be beyond the range? Brian Wenzel : Yes. The to 4.3 to 4.5 is the average for the full year, Betsy. So again, we gave you some projections in the first half. The real moving piece here, obviously, is the CECL impact, which is a little bit more muted the way the contractual calculations work. That then normalizes in the back half of the year. So -- but the 4.3 to 4.5 is the full year estimate. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So we could see the quarterlies be either side of that? Or within -- you're not really telling us, right? I just want to make sure. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Again, it's going to average out the 4.3 to 4.5, it could be at the lower end or it could be the higher end. Obviously, it's going to vary relative to the program performance and the credit performance of the portfolio. So it could vary. But again, I think across the full year, it will get back. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately, just on Verizon, an interesting new partner. Maybe Margaret, you could speak a little bit to the set of services and products, that you're going to be offering them, that was attractive to them, as to why they picked you? And then could you speak a little bit more to what kind of market opportunity you think is out there, given what Verizon represents? Margaret Keane : Yes. So first, we're going to be doing their co-branded card. It'll be branded Verizon. We'll -- we're working very closely with them to really make sure this is a state-of-the-art, digitally driven card. We're pretty excited about some of the things we're working on. We're not going to communicate the value prop and things like that because that's going to happen when we do a launch. Look, they have about 119 retail phone connections. So this is a pretty big opportunity for us, and we're excited about the partnership. They're highly engaged. I'd say we won the deal because of some of the investments we've been making. I think we turned the corner on the question mark in my mind of are we digitally savvy. And I think based on the winners that we -- the programs we won this year, I think we're winning because of these investments that we've made and the investments that we're going to continue to make. So very excited about Verizon. Betsy Graseck : 119 million customers, that's what you're talking about? Margaret Keane : No, we -- like phone connections. It's actually phone lines. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Margaret Keane : Somebody calculate it. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Margaret and Brian, you both referenced the data analytics and machine learning that you're investing in. And also commented that you've already started to strategically apply those insights. I am curious what you're seeing right now in terms of consumer behavior. There's a lot of talk about bifurcation amongst consumers. And given the breadth of your portfolio, I am wondering what you guys are seeing and how you are applying that strategically? Margaret Keane : I'm not sure what you mean by bifurcation, meaning good customers and bad customers from a credit perspective? Or... Richard Shane : Well, no, more economically, that there's such a divergence in the economy. And I'm curious if you are seeing greater or lesser opportunity, particularly in the middle and lower income brackets. Margaret Keane : No, I don't think we -- our underwriting standards are based on the consumer's capability to pay for the credit card. So that's core to how we underwrite. I think the things that we're looking to further enhances leveraging data from our partners. For instance, I'd say more in how we set a credit line upfront. So if the partner shares with us that this particular consumer shops vary heavily, we might give a higher credit line than we normally would, based on that data. I think one of the important aspects of our business different than maybe the general purpose credit card spaces, you can apply and buy right away. So we got to be very disciplined from a line size perspective when we give an initial line. And that's where I think we're really learning and really driving some good customer experience because we're sharing the data between us and the partner. I think the other area is helping us on fraud and true name and using identity and things like that, that are really helping us. So for instance, we've leveraged Payphone as an example, where now on our mobile app, you only have to fill out three lines. And that's really helping us do a better job at identifying that customer. And again, a lot of this has to do with because we're an apply-and-buy company, we have to be very diligent in identifying that as the right customer that's applying. Brian Doubles : Yes. Rick, maybe one thing just to add to that. I think it's -- what we've seen so far is now that our partners are sharing things, like spend levels, number of visits to the store, average basket size, payment behavior. Those metrics, which result in what we call an engagement index, really cuts across income levels. And so we're finding that to be a very powerful predictor in terms of how those accounts are going to perform, how they're going to behave from a spend perspective, but also a loss perspective and fraud as well. So it's benefiting us in a number of different areas. Ryan Cary : Great. Okay. That detail is very helpful. Operator : And we have our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Margaret and Brian Doubles, I wanted to ask you a question about whether you could give us a sense of your interest level in Synchrony's exposure to potentially merchant receivables and essentially making loans to merchants back by their sales. Is there any potential growth opportunity there, that you see for Synchrony? Is it something you haven't given much thought to, but would consider? Any color you can give us on that would be great. Margaret Keane : Yes. That's not a space that we're -- I would say, we are considering. I think we have laid out our strategy, as Brian focused on, I think we're going to stick to the things we really know and grow that way. I don't know if you... Brian Doubles : Yes. I mean, look, we're a consumer lender. That's what we're good at. We're going to stick to our knitting there. And we see a ton of great growth opportunities in our existing business, which we outlined. So I think never say never, but it's not on the strategic map right now. I think we've got a ton of great growth opportunity in all three of our platforms. We like what we're seeing in the direct-to-consumer space. So we're going full throttle in those areas, and we'll revisit at some point in the future. But right now, a lot of growth opportunity in the core. Bill Carcache : Understood. And so then perhaps sticking with the consumer. Is there any interest level and perhaps taking a look at international consumer at some point? Or again, is the growth opportunity enough in the U.S. that you see that's probably not something that you would consider near term again? Any color you can give on that would be helpful as well. Brian Doubles : Yes. Bill, look, it's something we've considered. We've talked about it to the leadership team and with the Board. Again, I think we see enough opportunity right now in our current market in the U.S. that we don't feel the need to go international, but never say never. The business does work in certain markets overseas. We've seen that. We'll continue to assess it, but nothing in the short term. Gregory Ketron : Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : I guess, final question here is, maybe talk about the pipeline of different opportunities. I mean, I guess, from a broad perspective, it seems like the more recent partner wins have been more technologically based with Verizon, PayPal, Venmo and so forth? And is there any changing dynamics with who you're going after? And is there any changing dynamics with respect to the competitive environment? Margaret Keane : Yes, I'll start with the second part. I think the competitive environment is pretty -- has been pretty consistent. I don't think anyone's doing anything too crazy out there. So I think we feel pretty good about where we're placed in the competitive environment. I think, look, we still want to win core retail deals. So this -- and if you look at our Payment Solutions business, a lot of what we won was the core of that business. I think these opportunities, that have come along or have been, I think, somewhat unique in terms of them coming into the marketplace. There's just not a lot of big retail deals that are out there right now, in terms of existing portfolios. We continue to see a number of smaller midsized deals that we have in our pipeline. I would say all three platforms have a pretty good pipeline of opportunity, and we're very focused on that. So I think you'll see us -- down the road, you'll see more retail deals. It's not like we're walking away from that space. I just think this is what was in the market and the opportunity for us to, in some cases, differentiate our portfolio a little bit. Gregory Ketron : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have, and we hope you have a great day. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. On the call this morning are Margaret Keane, Brian Wenzel, and Brian Doubles. I will now turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, our country and the world are facing an unprecedented global pandemic. I want to start by first thanking all of those working around the clock, especially our healthcare professionals and first responders on the frontlines, as well as those behind the scenes, including our dedicated employees who are working to serve our customers and partners. While all of us have been impacted in different ways and we may suffer from sadness and loss, I am also encouraged and inspired by the resolve of our society to come together in this crisis. I've seen much goodness, selfless acts, and community support. It's certainly one of the things I hope continues long after this is done. I also commit to our employees, our partners, our customers, and our community, we will continue to do all we can to support you. This global health crisis is challenging us as individuals and as leaders. It is also challenging companies to execute in an extraordinarily difficult environment. And one more word of thanks here to the leaders in Synchrony, who have stepped up in so many extraordinary ways through this incredibly difficult time. Thank you. Our company was founded in the 1930s as we began financing refrigerators in the Great Depression, and Synchrony has faced many other difficult periods, most recently, the great financial crisis in 2009. This is a combination of our heritage, strong culture, and our talented associates that will enable us to use our strengths to navigate these uncertain times, protect our employees, and continue to deliver for our cardholders, retailers, merchants, and providers. Later in the call, I will provide greater detail in our response to the COVID-19 outbreak. But first, let me share with you our results for the first quarter. First quarter earnings were $286 million or $0.45 per diluted share. This included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the CECL implementation in January. The increase attributable to CECL was $101 million or $76 million after-tax, which reduced EPS by $0.13. We generated solid growth in several key areas during the quarter. On a core basis which excludes Walmart and Yamaha portfolio, loan receivables grew 4%, which drove a 5% increase in interest and fees, purchase volume increased 6%, and average active accounts increased 4%. The efficiency ratio was 32.7% for the quarter. We grew deposits over $500 million or 1% over last year. And although we slowed the growth of deposits given the excess liquidity from the Walmart portfolio sales, we did continue to grow lower cost direct deposits at 3% rate over the prior-year. Our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth. And we continue to invest in our bank to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers. We extended and added partnership, we renewed several key relationships, and we added to our growing care credit network. We continue to be excited and are working closely with Verizon and Venmo to launch these new programs during 2020. While the ultimate launch date for the programs will be dependent on how the current environment develops, we anticipate a mid-year launch for Verizon and a launch in the second half for Venmo. We continue to remain highly focused on digital innovation, accelerating our data analytics capabilities and creating frictionless customer experiences, which are key to the success of our programs and winning new relationships. Driving digital self-penetration is key to our success. In Retail Card, digital sales penetration was 41% in the first quarter, and digital applications were 56% of our total application. The mobile channel alone grew 34% compared to the same quarter last year, excluding Walmart. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 billion of Synchrony common stock and paid $135 million or $0.22 per share in common stock dividends.  We are pleased with the strength of our business. However, we did experience a significant reduction in purchase volumes from COVID-19 in the second half of March which Brian will cover later in the call. The ultimate impact from this crisis is very difficult to quantify right now, with the duration and magnitude still largely unknown. However, we believe, we have an advantageous position to navigate through this uncertain time. Our portfolio is well-positioned from a credit perspective given changes we have made since the great financial crisis in addition to some of the more surgical modifications we've made in recent years. Further, our RSAs has historically proven to be an effective buffer during times of stress. We have a partner centric business model, and are more nimble than ever, giving us the ability to rapidly implement changes and enhancements. We have also built a robust data lake that gives us access to information across the business at an unprecedented level. Combine that with our analytics capabilities, and we have another powerful tool to help our partners manage through this period. The digital capabilities we've built, which has help us win important digital partner are another crucial tool, empowering our partners across the business to manage through this time by helping them to shift volume to online and mobile channel. Now I would like to spend some time focusing on the action Synchrony has taken for employees, partners, and communities. We have taken these actions in the spirit of assisting the communities in which we live and operate to assist in stemming the global health crisis, while still meeting the needs of our cardholders, retailers, merchants and providers. Each action we have taken has been with empathy and consideration for each constituency and we will continue to act as this crisis evolve. Our employees are the strengths of our company. We moved quickly and decisively to put actions in place that support the health, wellness, and safety of our colleagues across the globe. We are implementing a plan for 100% work from home structure. In U.S., employees from across our company from support functions, to our frontline contact center associates are all working from home. This has allowed us to stabilize our operation and service our customers, while keeping our employees safe. We are assisting our associates by covering the cost of Copays for virtual doctor visits for any employee who wishes to consult a medical professional, and enhancing our benefit to include expanded backup emergency care benefits, so that our colleagues have the childcare or elder care support needed. We are also providing financial planning and employee assistance along with wellness programs. For our contact center associates, we provided a one-time special bonus to thank them for their essential role they are playing in assisting our customers every single day without missing a bead. In addition, we are setting up an emergency fund to help our associates deal with unexpected financial challenges which may impact them during this period. For consumers that are experiencing financial hardship, we have the ability to assist these cardholders during this extremely difficult period. We will waive fees and interest charges, while we can extend promotional financing period. We will also waive minimum payments on existing balances for certain qualifying accounts. For those seeking the ability to expand our line to necessary purchases, we will evaluate credit limits if they meet our credit criteria. Many of our partners have been with us for decades and we have been there to help them grow their businesses. We are now here to help them protect it. We have taken an aggressive approach to ensure we continue to provide our partners and their customers with dependable service and products that they can use during this time of disruption. Our investments in making all of our digital assets fast and easy-to-use are helping them to serve their customers and our relationship managers are actively helping them and there has been no disruption to their availability to our partners. Our agile structure is helping to foster real time solutions and our dedicated teams are tirelessly working to support our partners and their customers. The communities where we live and work are such a core part of the fabric of Synchrony's culture. That's why we have committed $5 million to help local and national organizations assist those areas of the country most affected by COVID-19. We will be supporting groups like Feeding America and Meals on Wheels in the U.S., as well as organizations in Puerto Rico, India, and the Philippines. Also, our employees have contributed numerous hours to Synchrony's GearUp initiative. Employees have engaged in our communities to assist in making certain protective sizes such as a face shield using 3D printing, as well as selling gowns and masks through our network of cardholders who are actively engaged in the sewing community where we have a number of partners who sell sewing machines. We have also leveraged our CareCredit network and Synchrony is serving as a location in our communities where people can donate PPE items, and we are engaging in the transfer of items of need to various medical facilities. We are facing an extraordinary and unprecedented time. But Synchrony has the strength, the resources, and the resolve to fight this global health crisis for our employees, partners, customers, and communities. Having been in business for nearly a century, we have navigated various times of economic uncertainty by maintaining our focus on supporting our associates, partners, and their customers, while also continuing to invest in our businesses for the long-term. I am proud of what actions we have taken for our constituents. And I have confidence that through the strength of our business model and balance sheet, we will continue to navigate this crisis successfully, while maintaining our focus on the significant opportunities in our business, our long-term objectives, and strategic initiatives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel to review some of the key business trends we are seeing, the financial performance for the quarter, and views on the framework to help consider the impact of COVID-19 on our key outlook drivers. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Margaret, and good morning, everyone. First, let me echo Margaret's thanks for everyone who's working to keep our community safe and secure from our healthcare workers, first responders, to those in grocery stores or working on vaccines. The selflessness and dedication of these workers is a lot inspiring and deeply appreciated. In addition, I want to thank our employees around the world who are all adjusting to new ways of working to continue to serve our partners and customers. Thank you. Now turning to our financial results for the first quarter. I'll start in Slide 4 of the presentation. Before I move into the first quarter results, I want to cover some of the early trends we're seeing from the impact of COVID-19 from purchase volume perspective, as well as key aspects of our business that are important to highlight given the current environment we are now facing. Slide 4 shows year-over-year purchase volume growth for the total company, as well as for world sales from our Dual and Co-Branded cards for January, February, and March. March is split between the first half of the month and then the second half where the impact related to COVID-19 increased significantly. Purchase volume growth was strong through mid-March with double-digit growth for both total company and world sales volumes. In the second half of March as mandates increased at the federal and state levels, travel, entertainment and event activity were significantly curtailed and a high number of the non-essential retail stores closed. As a result, purchase volume for both the total company and world sales declined significantly decreasing by 26% and 27% respectively in the second half of March. The trends are continuing into April. Looking at the year-over-year growth rates of world sales by category, during the pre-travel restriction period, defined as the month of January, and then the growth post-travel restriction periods through the end of the first quarter, we experienced changes in spend categories, similar to overall industry trends. Grocery, discount drugstore spend increased significantly post-January, while restaurant, entertainment, gas, and specialty travel declined significantly during the same period. While restaurants entertainment, gas, and travel were significantly impacted, only 27% of 2019 world sales incurred in these categories. Obviously, these are trends that will impact our purchase volume and loan receivable growth going forward. The ultimate impact is still uncertain given the duration and the magnitude of this pandemic is still largely unknown at this point. Moving to Slide 5, we highlight the higher quality asset base today versus our 2008 asset base going into the great financial crisis. This is a direct result of our strategy to improve asset quality through disciplined underwriting and advance we've made in our underwriting processes that have been very effective in managing overall credit quality. I'd like to highlight various aspects of our credit management program. First, we have a very experienced credit team and we're very disciplined in our approach to underwriting. Second, we control all underwriting and credit decisions in our programs and across our sales platforms. Our credit strategies are tailored to the partner industry in which we operate as unique by channel for origination and account management. As shown on the left side of the page, using FICO as comparative measure 73% of the portfolio have the FICO score above 660 compared to 61% in 2008. More importantly, in the higher loss generating FICO range of 600 or lower, we've reduced our exposure to 9% of the portfolio compared to 19% in 2008. This is a significant improvement in portfolio quality; we shifted 12% of the portfolio from balances at or below 660 FICO to above 660 FICO with a 4% increase in balances with FICOs that are 721 or higher. As we exited the great financial crisis, we made the strategic decision to improve the credit quality of our portfolio and this is reflected in the quality of our new account origination mix since 2010. Over 80% of accounts we have originated since 2010 have FICOs above 660, with 45% of the accounts having FICO of 721 or higher, less than 1% of what we originated had FICOs that were 600 or lower. We're also using advanced underwriting techniques in managing the portfolio. Some example of this are for account acquisition, we are utilizing up to 16 different data sources and more than 4,000 attributes to validate creditworthiness and to authenticate customer identity. We are employing a multi algorithmic approach to target specific outcomes, credit, fraud, synthetic IDs, and other malicious behavior, as well as leveraging clients designated to use customer engagement with our partners to assign more effective credit lines. For account management, we're continuing to utilize internal and credit bureau triggers to dynamically reevaluate the customers' creditworthiness to manage credit exposure, as well as leveraging the latest technology to passively authenticate customers and more selectively target high risk behavior. This is evident in the approved purchase volume mix from the time we deployed these underwriting techniques in 2016. The chart on the right hand side of the page shows the improvement in the purchase volume mix from first quarter 2016, which shows 65% of the purchase volume mix being at 721 plus FICO for the first quarter compared to 61% in the first quarter of 2016. Finally, it should be now that our portfolio is well diversified by industry and we've been growing payment solutions in CareCredit portfolios at a faster rate than Retail Card and we don't have any significant geographic concentrations. In summary, we have substantially improved the asset quality of our portfolio compared to the portfolio we had during the great financial crisis. We have developed better tools and capabilities and can deploy underwriting changes more quickly and with greater efficacy than ever before. Slide 6 shows you a longer-term view on how we perform from a loss perspective, dating back to the great financial crisis when loss rate for card issuers peaked in 2009. The general perception is that private label credit cards will perform slightly worse than general purpose cards in periods of higher credit losses. But you can see in the top chart that our credit performance was relatively in line with general purpose card issuers in the 10% to 11% loss range in 2009 on a managed basis. One of the keys to the loss experience being similar is that the severity of loss is lower for us due to the average balance being generally lower than general purpose cards. For the first quarter, the average balance per active account was $1,171 which is flat to last year. If you look at this on a risk adjusted yield basis, we outperformed the general purpose card peers by a wide margin through the crisis, with a risk adjusted yield running over 700 basis points higher than the peer group. As we move beyond the cycle, and losses have declined, our risk adjusted yield outperformance compared to general purpose card issuers has remained over 600 basis points post-crisis. RSAs also provide a buffer. This was evident in 2009 and again beginning 2016 through 2018 as credit costs increase as shown in the chart in the lower right hand corner of Slide 6. While the driver of the countercyclical nature of RSAs are credit related, other factors also impact the RSAs such as program revenue, expenses, and mix. In 2009, RSAs as a percentage of average receivables declined to 1.6%, 64% below the more normalized RSA average of 4.43% for 2013 through 2016. The strong risk adjusted yield and countercyclical nature of RSAs were important elements in our ability to remain profitable through the great financial crisis as both highlight the earnings resiliency of our business model. The company generated around a 1% return on assets at the height of the crisis in 2009. Given the items I've highlighted earlier, while we're not expecting the level of charge-offs resulting from the current situation to be similar to the great financial crisis, we felt it was important to give you some historical context on the key elements that sets our business apart from others in the industry. Moving to the first quarter financial results on Slide 7. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $286 million or $0.45 per diluted share. This included an increase in the provision for credit losses, as a result of the implementation of CECL in January. The increase was $101 million or $76 million after-tax which reduced EPS by $0.13. We generated solid year-over-year growth in several areas as noted on Slide 8. On a core basis, which excludes the Walmart and Yamaha portfolios, loan receivables were up 4% and interest and fees on loan receivables were up 5% driven by growth in receivables. On a core basis purchase volume was 6% and average active accounts increased 4% over last year. On Slide 8, we have included Dual and Co-Branded card purchase volumes and loan receivable balances to provide the level of diversification we have to these products. Dual and Co-Branded cards account for 38% of the total purchase volume in the first quarter and grew 8% over prior-year. They accounted for 24% of the total loan receivables portfolio and grew 6% over the prior-year. Overall, we're pleased with the underlying growth we generate across the business. As I noted earlier the impact of COVID-19 accelerated as we move through the quarter with most of the impact occurring late in the quarter. We are expecting a more substantial impact this quarter, but given the duration and the magnitude is still largely unknown at this point, it's difficult to provide a more precise forecast of the impact. RSAs decreased $20 million or 3% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.4% for the quarter at the lower end of the range we expected in the first quarter, due to higher credit loss reserve builds. The provision for credit losses increased $818 million, or 95% from last year. The increase was primarily driven by the Walmart credit loss reserve reduction last year that totaled $522 million. The higher reserve build in the first quarter partially offset by lower net charge-offs accounted for the remaining increase. The reserve build in the first quarter was $552 million and largely due to the projected impact of COVID-19 related losses. Other income increased $5 million. Other expense was down $41 million, or 4% due to cost reductions from Walmart, partially offset by higher operational losses and expenses related to the COVID-19 response. So overall, the company continued to generate solid results in the first quarter outside of the impacts from COVID-19. I will take a moment to highlight our platform results on Slide 9. In Retail Card core loan receivable growth was 3% with solid growth driven primarily by our digital partners; other metrics were down driven by the sale of the Walmart portfolio. Payment Solutions delivered a strong quarter with broad-based growth across the sales platform and strength in home furnishings and home specialty that resulted in core loan receivable growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loan increased 3% primarily driven by loan receivable growth. Purchase volume and average active accounts increased 2%. We signed a number of new partners and renewed key partnerships this quarter. We continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships with card networks. These networks, along with other initiatives, such as driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 30% of purchase volume excluding oil and gas that helps us to drive solid results. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter; receivable growth of 7% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans increased 9% primarily driven by the loan receivable growth. Purchase volume was up 2% and our average active accounts increased 5%. We continue to expand our network and the utility of our card as we've added over 2,000 new provider locations to our network during the quarter. Network expansion has helped to drive the reuse rate to 56% purchase volume in the first quarter. We did start to see the effects of COVID-19 on the platform results as the quarter progressed. In Retail Card, while store closing impacted results, we also saw strong growth in digital purchase volume that helped offset some of the COVID-19 impact. In Payment Solutions while store closings have a less pronounced impact, promotional offerings and the growth in areas such as home specialty help mitigate some of this impact. For CareCredit, we continue to see good performance in areas such as veterinary partially offset by reductions in elective procedures. We do expect the effects will carry into the next quarter, and be more pronounced as many of the store closings occurred during the latter part of March. I'll move to Slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 8% from last year, primarily driven by a 7% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the Walmart portfolio. On a core basis interest and fees on loans increased 5%. The net interest margin was 15.15% compared to last year's margin of 16.08%. The main factors driving the margin performance were a decline in loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets. The mix declined from 84.4% to 81.7% driven by the higher liquidity during the quarter that mainly resulted from the proceeds of the Walmart portfolio sale in October of last year. A 47 basis point decrease in loan receivables yield to 20.67% primarily driven by the sale of the Walmart portfolio, partially offset by a 14 basis point decrease in total interest bearing liabilities cost of 2.50% primarily driven by lower benchmark rates. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.24% compared to 4.92% last year and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.10% compared to 2.51% last year. If you exclude the impact of the Walmart portfolio, the 30-plus delinquency rate was down approximately 15 basis points, and the 90-plus delinquency rate was down approximately five basis points compared to last year. Focusing on net charge-off trends. The net charge-off rate was 5.36% compared to 6.06% last year. The reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by Walmart and improving credit trends. Excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio, net charge-off rate was approximately 15 basis points lower than last year. This was better than expectation of around 50 basis point increase in the fourth quarter net charge-off rate of 5.15%. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.13% post-seasonal implementation, which included a $3.02 billion day one transition adjustment. Excluding the effect of CECL, the allowance under the ALLL method would have been 7.34%. The reserve build in the first quarter was $552 million under CECL and $451 million under the ALLL method. The overall reserve provisioning was higher than expected due to the impact of COVID-19 which accounted for most of the reserve build in the first quarter. In summary, the first quarter credit trends were slightly better than our expectations excluding the COVID-19 impact. We expect credit trends will be impacted by this as we move forward. The extent of the impact is difficult to assess at this point, given the uncertainty around the duration and the magnitude of the pandemic, as well as the potential effects from the CARES Act and our efforts to providing relief to cardholders impacted by COVID-19. Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1 billion down $41 million or 4% from last year. The decline was driven by cost reductions from Walmart. This was partially offset by higher expenses attributable to operational losses and certain expenditures related to our response to COVID-19. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 32.7% versus 31% last year. Excluding the impact from operational losses, and the COVID-19 expenses, the efficiency ratio was flat compared to the prior-year. Moving to Slide 13, over the last year, we've grown our deposits over $500 million, or 1%. This puts deposits at 79% of refunding compared to 75% last year. While we slowed the overall deposit growth in the first quarter, given the excess liquidity for the Walmart portfolio sale in the fourth quarter of last year, we did continue to grow our lower cost direct deposits at a slightly higher 3% pace over the prior year. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $24.8 billion which equates over 25% of our total assets. This is up from 22% last year. Before I provide detail on our capital and liquidity position, it should be noted that we're electing to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in March, which had two primary benefits. First, it delays the effects of the transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, allows a portion of the current period provisioning under CECL to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the first quarter at 14.3% CET-1 under the CECL transition rules. They're the same levels last year. Tier-1 capital ratio is 15.2% under the CECL transition rules, compared to 14.5% last year reflecting the preferred stock issuance last November. The total capital ratio increased 70 basis points as well to 16.5% also reflecting the preferred issuance. And the Tier-1 capital ratio plus reserves ratio on a fully faith-in basis increased to 24.1%, a 280 basis point increase over the prior-year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing CECL and the preferred stock issuance. During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced last May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share and repurchased $1 billion or 33.6 million shares of common stock during the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had 366 million of remaining share repurchase capacity of the $4 billion authorized plan for the current capital plan cycle. Given the current economic uncertainty, and being as prudent as possible, we've made the decision to halt further share purchases under this plan so we had greater visibility of the depth and magnitude of the current environment. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy we outlined previously. We're committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and operating with strong capital and liquidity levels. In closing, we normally provide updates to our outlook. Given the number of uncertainties that exists regarding the severity and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the countering impact of actions such as the CARES Act, payment assistance for our customers, government and regulatory actions that may have is very difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this time. As a result, our expectations have changed versus the outlook we provided in January, and that guidance should no longer be relied upon. Since the duration and magnitude of the current environment is uncertain, we can't provide any ranges around the key outlook drivers for 2020. But I want to provide a framework to help consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers. Regarding loan receivable growth, COVID-19 has significant impact on the purchase volume particularly late in the first quarter. We anticipate continued deterioration of purchase volumes on a year-over-year basis until the situation improves, presumably later this year. What may help mitigate some of this impact is growth in digital. And we're well-positioned for this through our digital partners, as well as leveraging our expertise to help other partners and providers. The overall net deterioration in purchase volume will ultimately impact our receivable growth rate. When considering net interest margin, we will be impacted by the reduction in prime rates resulting from the Fed rate cuts, a reduction in investment income from our liquidity portfolio, as well as a potential impact of forbearance in terms of interest in fee waivers for a temporary period of time. Partially offsetting the margin compression is the expected higher interest income generated from an increase in the number of accounts of revolver in the loan receivable portfolio and lower interest expense as benchmark rates are lower. While it should be noted we also share the impact of revenues and funding costs to the RSA. Regarding RSAs in addition to sharing the net interest income impacts, we'll also see a more pronounced impact from higher credit costs as we move through the year. Also as noted in January, the impact of CECL on RSAs will be more fully realized in the second half of the year. While we expect an increase in net charge-off rate as the year progresses, it should be noted that the overall portfolio quality and credit trends as we entered this pandemic are strong and the tools and capabilities that we have are more advanced in the great financial crisis, which were highlighted earlier in the call. Finally, we also believe higher recoveries will ultimately materialize partially mitigating the impact of higher losses. Similar to revenue, we also share the impact of higher credit costs for the RSA. While we expect the reserve builds to be higher than original expectations, until we gain more visibility into the duration and severity of the current pandemic, we cannot provide more specific guidance. Once we have greater visibility, we'll be in a better position to define the expected charge-off and reserve build expectations going forward. Regarding the efficiency ratio, activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels. And we look to mitigate some of this impact through expense reduction opportunities. We will continue to assess the situation and provide guidance when we have greater visibility into the effects of the current environment. Fundamentally, the business remains strong and is resilient, and we go into this situation with a strong balance sheet, capital, and liquidity position. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call to Q&A. We continue to believe that the strength in our business model and the resiliency of our associates will help us navigate this global health crisis. We are focused on continuing to execute for our retailers, merchants, and providers and support our cardholders with empathy during this difficult period. We are focused on execution today, but also focused on continuing to make strategic investments in our business, to build on our strengths to deliver the products and services, our customers will expect beyond this period. Thank you for participating on the call today. And I want to wish you and your families all the very best as we continue to deal with this very typical situation. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning guys and thanks very much for the comments in the call. Brian Wenzel : Good morning, John. Margaret Keane : Good morning. John Hecht : I'm just wondering, Brian, you guys cited your volumes and sales down about 25%, 26% in the second half of March. Just trying to think about your modeling for the near-term quarters. Is that the type of contraction seen thus far through April and how do we think about the kind of what you've seen thus far in April? Brian Wenzel : Yes, thanks, John. Good morning. From the back half of March, which was down again about 26% it accelerated slightly. So we're running in the range of down 30% to 35% pretty consistently for the first part of April. Again, when you think about the world spend categories we highlighted in the earnings chart, they're very similar with regard to being down in travel, gas and entertainment and a little stronger in grocery, drugstore, et cetera. But again, that's just on the Dual card, but the strength of the digital assets, we do have some retailers that are deemed essential that are open and clearly the digital and e-commerce is continue to drive it. So it's pretty steady in that, that low 30% decline year-over-year. John Hecht : Okay, great. Thanks, that's very helpful. And second question just kind of think about the context of this versus the Great Recession where I guess what in your economic models that have driven your -- the allowance levels, what level kind of unemployment are you contemplating at this point in time or how do we think about the economic -- the economic assumptions relative to the 2009 period? Brian Wenzel : Sure John. So let me kind of go through how we think about or how we thought about this quarter in building the ACL reserve. As you know the economic assumptions vary pretty widely across many of the institutions that provide -- that -- we don't come up with our own assumptions, we use external assumptions. So given the variation that we saw across many, many institutions, we modeled several different scenarios and looked at several different scenarios in how they would perform relative to our book and then we settled in on a set of assumptions from one -- one place that really looked at a unemployment rate approaching 10% for the second quarter as kind of the peak and then a second half recovery where unemployment was down to around 7%. And then a very kind of more gradual decline in 2021 and gets back to probably about a 4.5% unemployment as you think about it in 2022. With that, bankruptcy is rising about 50% and staying elevated for the next couple of years, was also very key assumption in that. And then a significant contraction in GDP for the second quarter again with the second half recovery but obviously being down for the full-year. So that's kind of how we thought about it. Now, when you take that and go back to the great financial crisis, very, very different set of scenarios where you had a consumer that was stressed, you had unemployment lag, you do not have the timing and the amount of the stimulus coming through to the consumer. So it's pretty -- it's a pretty different scenario to try to compare back to it. And then if you really go back and look at the portfolio, John, the portfolio is fundamentally different. Obviously, Walmart's gone, the amount of assets that we have above 660 shifted significantly. The amount we've invested in our advanced underwriting the tools and technology is very, very different. So, we feel comfortable. As we kind of sit here today that the portfolio is in very good credit quality up until mid-March, we actually saw credit quality improving or continuing to improve year-over-year which was positive to us. So the consumer came in a great stead. We have this kind of economic situation really coming out of the pandemic, and then we have a ton of stimulus loan through, so, very, very different from our perspective. Operator : We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. I was hoping that you could kind of just give a little bit of little more kind of detail around the -- what you would like to achieve with the deferments and how it's going to work like, any kind of granularity about what people are asking for, what are you giving and what do you see as the percentage of the portfolio that's likely to be in that bucket in some future point, say, end of the second quarter? Brian Wenzel : Sure, good morning, Moshe. So let me break down the forbearance that we're providing to our customers. So the first thing that we're doing is if a customer calls in and has been impacted, if they're asking for a waiver of a late fee or interest charges, we are waiving those. For qualifying counts, we also will waive the min payment. So if actually defer the min payment on the account for up to three months and kind of hold them in their due stage if you're current, bring that back if you're too due to current. So really give them the opportunity to kind of get their situation a little bit more in a word. We're also in the promotional book are extending for periods up to 90 days, the deferral of the expiration of the promo. So those are the primary forms of relief that we're providing to those people. So if you look at how many people have taken advantage of that for us, it's about 800,000 accounts to-date, and about $1.6 billion in balances. So if you think about it, a small percentage yet has taken advantage of the program. And we have not seen tremendous amount of people needing that that min pay deferral at this point. But again, we'll continue to offer that to help our cardholders through this time. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks for that. And maybe just can you talk a little bit either Brian, you or Margaret, about just the discussions you're having with your retail partners now and what it is, they're asking from you and what are you asking from them? Margaret Keane : Yes, so I'd say right out of the gate, probably the biggest thing was really stabilization of the operation. Obviously, one of the things we worked hard to do, which was pretty miraculous actually was to get our employees all work from home including our call center. So we're pretty close to 100% work at home right now. So from a servicing level, we're meeting and making sure we're exceeding the service levels for our customers. And I think that was really important. We kind of have a mixed bag here because we have retailers who are opening and servicing customers, we have very big online partners who are servicing their customers. And then we have retailers who have actually closed. So I would say all our teams are highly focused on both our retail partners and our providers having the relationship managers connecting with them. Obviously they're -- they want to make sure that we're reacting in the right way for their end consumer and doing the right things both from a forbearance perspective, but also from a credit perspective. And we're in daily dialogues with them. I would say, we feel pretty good about where we are we got a pretty nice note from one of our partners who was really thrilled to see how we've been able to service our customers through this. So highly engaged, we're not sitting back. We're having those conversations and making sure that we have clear dialogue all along the way. Operator : We have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. Brian, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit you'd mentioned the unemployment assumption you have is around 10%. I assume that's higher in April. Can you sort of flush that out? And I feel like your allowance at around 11%, I would assume that needs to go higher. Can you talk about the reserve build, let's say in Q2 versus Q1 that would be helpful. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes, thank you, Don. So if you think about it, really under the CECL methodology and ACL, we obviously use a set of assumptions at the point in time, which we make the estimate for the reserve. As we stepped into April again, there's a pretty wide disparity among people with regard to peak unemployment that will happen in the second quarter. But again, a lot of it, one of the most important parts is what is the recovery period look like? And from that peak, as you move down how quickly does it move down and how does it move down? So, most certainly the development of the retail landscape, the development of how the consumer in the stimulus bridges people through this period of time is going to be critical. If you kind of follow through and say yes, there is a deterioration in the assumptions on the unemployment peak in that recovery period and the effects of the stimulus then that there would be higher reserve posts coming in the second quarter, but we're only 20 days into the quarter at this point, Don. So I really can't give you with clarity, the exact reserve posts, we would see. We need to see how those assumptions really develop here in the second quarter as we move through and again that recovery period and the effects of the stimulus are really important attributes. Operator : And we have our next question from Ryan Cary with Bank of America. Ryan Cary : Good morning. I hope you're all well and thank you for taking my question. Given all the moving pieces, could you provide a little more insight on how you're seeing the pace of charge-offs ramping. Well I understand the turning the magnitude itself is hard to predict, with the forbearance plans and government support programs all else equal, is it fair to assume net charge-offs will be pushed out further than they would otherwise? And how you think about potential impact, assuming unemployment is elevated for a couple of quarters versus a couple of months? Brian Wenzel : Yes, good morning, Ryan, and thank you for your wishes. So as we think about it today, obviously the forbearance which isn't, hasn't been that much for us could delay potential net charge-offs. Again, I think the stimulus package will help bridge some consumers here for a period of time. We would begin to expect that you would see charge-offs really begin to elevate in the latter part of the third quarter, probably the fourth quarter and into 2021. Again, the magnitude of that we think we've covered in our ACL reserve here at the end of the first quarter, but the timing that is really going to depend again on this peak and how the recovery begins to come out as we develop here in the second quarter to be honest with you. Ryan Cary : Okay. And I was hoping you could spend some time on the discussions you're having with retailers around signing new programs or renewing partnerships. I know you called out a couple during the quarter. But how does the current environment impact the prospect pipeline? And can you discuss the impact of the pace of new business deals both in 2020 and beyond? Margaret Keane : Yes, believe it or not, there are deals in the pipeline. And we are having conversations and we are sitting on deals, I would say things, conversations, maybe have slowed a little bit, just as people have been trying to deal with all the challenges facing but we feel pretty good about the pipeline that's there. We've been able to be -- I think and going to be very discriminatory on the things we do look at to make sure they fit where we want to go with the business. But I would say in all three platforms, we've had good activity and I think continue to have that good activity. We'll have to see as the rest of the year progresses. But right now, we do have a decent pipeline. Brian Wenzel : Yes, what I would add, Ryan, to that, as we think about these relations, Margaret really, really highlighted when you target them, when we go to think about the economics with them. Clearly, we will always price through a deterioration economic plan, whenever you think about a seven year deal or a 10-year deal, we, as an enterprise, think about through the cycle. Clearly as we would look at this scenario, the cycle is at the beginning of that potential relationship and the depth of it. So we are probably a little bit more conservative and really will do that deal only if it meets a -- what we view as a risk adjusted return that we think is conservative at this point. Operator : We have our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. First on the RSA, I think Brian you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the RSA impact will related to CECL day two would be coming in the back half of the year maybe could you give us some of the puts and takes there and degree of magnitude that you're looking for? Brian Wenzel : Yes, thank you, and good morning. So, as you think about it, world's kind of changed from January a little bit. First, I just want to make sure that that we have a perspective on the reserve provision for the quarter and the difference between CECL and ALLL. If you think about the total reserve build for the quarter being $551 million, $515 million, I\u2019m sorry $511 million of that is really related to COVID-19 and $40 million. So less than our expectations as we entered the quarter kind of came from the core book, which really reflected the higher credit quality that we experienced in the vast majority of the quarter. As you think about it, the whole $551 million is CECL. So we highlighted if we did ALLL, the $451 million, if we did CECL it's $551 million. But as you think about the $551 million that ultimately is what's going to pass-through to the extent that is subject to the RSA will pass-through to the RSA. So we would expect, what I would say a sequential dollar -- lowering dollars of the RSA as we step through the year and it obviously as a percent of ALR. So you will see that that in the second quarter and then really more into the second half of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so that is the reason it's moving into the second half of the function of the revenue recognition on the part of your retailer clients, I'm assuming? Brian Wenzel : No, Betsy, it's -- as we implemented CECL and through the RSAs again, we did not change the economic. Sharing is just really the mechanics of how it passed from us through the RSA. And that just had a slight lag to it. So, there is no difference. If you think about through the RSA in 2020, whether it's CECL or ALLL the reserve itself just comes on a slight lag. So you'll begin to feel that more in the second half. And it's more than just the mechanics of how it works through the program agreements with our retail partners, then their revenue recognition or some other type of change to the economics, just was more mechanics on it -- on how it works in the program agreement. But again, we expect the sequential benefit as we move throughout the year. Betsy Graseck : Right, got it. And then just the follow-up question, Margaret, for you is given the changes that we've had here over the last couple of months. How are you thinking about opportunities to either expand your functionality or what you can deliver to your retail partners or your CareCredit partners? I'm just wondering if there is opportunities for picking up technology or other types of systems or functionality that could enhance your offerings? Margaret Keane : Yes, I'd say two things. One, even before the pandemic, we were starting to get a little bit of opportunities out there that were starting to perk our interests. We've kept those warm. I think right now you got to really wait to see how valuations play out. So we're not going to jump into anything too quickly. But there are things that are out there, but that are certainly of interest to us. On the second piece, I think the other thing that we've done is we have actually, we looked our strategic initiatives for 2020 and have realigned our teams a little bit to focus and accelerate some of the digital things that we were working on or planning to do. We've stopped some things that we think we can hold off till 2021. And took those agile teams and are putting them against more digital capability for the company. And I think that's going to help us as we come out of -- or go through this and we give our partners and the end consumers more digital capability. Obviously, we're certainly winning on the digital side in terms of our online penetration and our volume coming through there. So we know this is a really critical thing. So even not only the opportunities externally, but I think we have and have already started the teams and kicked it off and driving it forward. I don't know Brian Doubles, if you would add anything there. Brian Doubles : Yes, the only thing maybe I would add as, Margaret said, we did move very quickly. And we actually went through every strategic project in the business. And there were things that were obvious things that our partners were asking us to accelerate for them to help them get through this difficult time. So we redeployed agile in there. And then there were some things that, we did around special promotions for some of our partners that still have stores open and are still very active online. And then, as Margaret said, some things that we paused were just things that in this environment didn't make sense. So we had some card reissues, Dual card upgrade, things like that, that we repositioned or delayed and moved to the kind of the back half of the year when things become a little more stable. Operator : Our next question is from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question and thanks for providing as much color as I guess recently can be expected, given all the circumstances. Hey I wanted to follow-up just quickly on the previous question on forbearance, the relatively modest number of accounts and balances you highlighted. Just curious have most people been through a billing cycle, I mean in the sense that you get a sense that they're aware of what potential relief is available to them, just trying to get a sense for how we should think about the number of accounts and balances that ultimately maybe a month from now take advantage of these policies? Brian Wenzel : Yes, great. Thanks for the question. So we have used our assets or digital assets, social media channels, et cetera to get out to our cardholders the benefits that are available for them if they've been impacted by COVID-19. So we have this outreach program. Well, certainly we are still taking a large number of calls to our call center. So we are talking to the consumers about we not they needed, part of it when you think about the dollar is different than some of our other peers. Our average balance is much smaller than theirs given the percentage of private label. But again even our retail Duel cards are more low and growth strategy. So again 2% of the balances we think it's pretty reasonable. But everyone has been through a billing cycle. And again, I think part of it is as they go through this, we put this plan in place in I think on March 11. We will begin to see the effects, I mean, obviously, certain people have had continued to work for a period of time or maybe on a furlough plan, but they may be just starting to realize that they need assistance and we will continue to provide that assistance as we move forward, so that number will grow. But again, we're using our assets to make sure that customers who do need forbearance, we're helping them. David Scharf : Got it, got it. And just a follow-up on the retail partner side and I appreciate the color on purchase volume trends in April to-date. Ignoring for the moment, the fact that digital is somewhat of a mitigating factor. I'm wondering just within Retail Card and within well, actually all three product segments are you able to provide sort of a percentage of the number of partners that are physically closed obviously, you've benefited from having exposure to discount clubs, home improvement places that are staying open deemed to be essential services. Just trying to get little bit of a --? Margaret Keane : Yes, we've been monitoring that but I would say most on the Retail Card side, while they may be actually closed, they all have some digital presence. So that's a little bit of what we're seeing, it gets a little more complicated on the Payment Solutions side, where we have over close to 200,000 merchants to really know which one of them are actually closed slowly or doing some online. Obviously, there are certain things that I think or some of our partners don't have online capability. And then obviously in CareCredit, really what we're seeing there is two things, emergency dental is still happening. Emergency that's still happening. Believe it or not, we've seen a little spike for all of you who have young kids out there we've seen a little spike in orthopedics. So people are hurting themselves in their home and on their bikes and things like that. So it's a little hard to give you a number. I would say what we're trying to do is wherever there is a digital capability; we're very focused with those partners to make sure we're delivering. But and it also varies by region as you know, we have some states that are still open where the stores are open. So little hard to give you a percentage or a number because it's such a mix. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Vincent Caintic : Hey, thanks. Good morning and thanks so much for taking my question. Just two quick ones. So understanding and thinking about the purchase volume declines and maybe assets start to shrink. On the funding side of that, how are you thinking about deposits and pricing deposits? Or I just -- I'm just thinking how low are you willing to price deposits to rightsize in the case of the asset? Brian Wenzel : Yes, thanks for the question, Vince. And so the way we think about the funding side of the stack clearly, in the economic environment that we're in, our view is using the unsecured or secured market is not as cost effective. So deposits for us, which are 79% of the debts back at the end of the first quarter, we'll continue to grow that probably as a percent of the overall funding stack. So look to lean a little bit more there. For us, it's going to be, we have a couple of primary competitors in that market. And we look to stay competitive there. So this way, we don't have to invest as much in marketing and things like that. So on a rate basis, we actually have moved down this year with regard to high yield savings, we're down 30 basis points on the high yield savings; we were also down at least 30 on our certificate deposit movements on top of what we already moved down in 2019. So we'll continue to evaluate that market, but that would be one of our primary sources relative to that. So our view is hopefully we'll be able to trend that down or continue to trend that down throughout 2020. Vincent Caintic : Okay. Thank you and a follow-up, quick follow-up question RSAs. When I look on Slide 6 of your deck and see the net charge-off ratio was 11% in 2009 and the RSAs were 1.5%. Is that still a appropriate correlation or is there any way to think about that? Brian Wenzel : Yes, clearly, what I tell you, Vincent, is RSAs will move and provide that countercyclical buffer. So as charge-offs do come through, you will see a reduction in the RSA percentages. The exact correlation of the percent to the charge-off rate again, as I indicated, earlier on this call, the fact that we don't have Walmart, the fact that you have a very different economic scenario between the great financial crisis. And now I don't want to draw the direct correlation, but you will see the similar shape to that curve when the benefit as it comes through. Operator : Our next question is from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks so much for taking my question. I really do also appreciate all the detail that you've provided. When you think about the reserve builds from CECL versus growth, for growth versus changes in your unemployment expectations, given the reduction and year-over-year purchase volume and the potential contraction of the loan book. Wouldn't that provide a cushion as far as reserve releases and create some really big quarter-over-quarter variability? So do you think about -- how do you think about those two pieces? And do you think about them over the full-year instead of quarter-to-quarter? And it looks like to me that perhaps the reserve build could be basically zero given the -- for the full-year given the reduction possibility in the actual loans? Brian Wenzel : Yes, the first thing, first thank you for your question. I think we have to be a little bit careful here on data points, right. We gave you a snapshot to try to be transparent about what happened between March 15 and March 31 on purchase volume being down 26% and then for the first couple of weeks of April being down around 30% to 35%. What's really unclear is when the mandates left, right, and retail comes back online, what that retail landscape will look like and the shape of that curve. So I'm not necessarily sure if I were you, I would be thinking about, we're going to have a 30% decline in retail purchase volume or purchase volume for the company for the remainder of the year. So that's, that's number one. Number two, you also have to remember in this period of time, when you're going through economic environment that we are, you are going to see the payment rates decline. So you'll see an upward bias in theory on the asset rate, so you have those two things moving against each other. It will then really look to what for us from a reserving perspective will be as we think about the portfolio at that point in time. What is the economic assumption? So I'm not necessarily sure I'd say okay, your portfolio is going to decline and therefore you'll be at zero. There are several factors that are moving in different directions, inside of that. Again, if you see the deterioration in the macroeconomic assumptions that we've used for March, you do see retail come back online, then I do believe you're going to see provisions for credit losses as we move forward. Dominick Gabriele : Great, thanks. So appreciate the clarification there. And then your consumer installment loan yields actually had a nice little jump, what do you think the trajectory on those yields are over, is that because of kind of the expectation for added risk and so you upped the yield or what are you thinking on the go-forward trajectory there and is that sustainable? Brian Wenzel : That is really being driven by the disposition of Yamaha in the first quarter. Dominick Gabriele : Okay, great. Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Greg Ketron : So we have time for one more question. Operator : And thank you. Our last question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. And I hope you guys are staying healthy and safe. I guess, Margaret, you mentioned the Venmo and the Verizon product launches are on track. When we think and you mentioned they're sort of subject to the evolving macro landscape. I guess when we think about any commitments you had made to grow the portfolio. So how should we think about that? And then maybe I'll just ask my second question related to that, as we think about some of the investment spend that you had, that you guys were embarking on and other broad investment spend, how can we think about the flexibility of those expenses in this backdrop? Thanks. Margaret Keane : Sure. So let me answer the first one. So, clearly we were really excited when we won both Verizon and Venmo. And those are two I think very strategic programs for us as we continue to really build out our digital capabilities. So those agile teams that have been focused on the launch of those two programs have full speed ahead. And we haven't reduced any focus, if anything; we're even maybe accelerating some things there. So we're really excited about being able to launch them, obviously, the launches will be dependent upon the environment, we believe mid-year for Verizon and the second half for Venmo. So excited about those and the teams are really working hard. In terms of the other investments. It's a little bit of what Brian Doubles said, we actually took a step back -- let me step back even one step further, what we did as a leadership team, I mean despite all the negative things that are happening around pandemic, there's also opportunities right? And so what we really tried to do is step back and say, how do we take part of our leadership team to focus on the operation and get the operation stabilized. We have another group that are working on what do we look like coming out of this? And how quick do we come out? And what are the initiatives we have to have in place to come out? And then, three, what are the long-term opportunities and implications for the company. And so we've kind of organized ourselves that way. And we have seven work streams that Brian is leading to really kind of set us up for the future. So Brian, I don't know if you want to comment a little more on our flexibility in some of the things we've been doing. Brian Doubles : Yes, I think that's right. So we went. As I said earlier through every strategic project in the business, we kind of looked at that through the lens of the current realities that we're facing, and we said, okay, some of these things we need to move faster on based on what our partners are trying to achieve as they go through the crisis. And then some things frankly, just don't make sense to do right now. We're going to push those out, delay, pause, et cetera. And then some things we'll just continue and Verizon and Venmo are examples of things that will continue, as Margaret said, a little bit uncertain. But then we also said, okay, we need to be thinking beyond 2020. We need to be thinking coming out of this, how can we best position ourselves for the future. And we said, look there are, we came up with seven or eight different work streams that are really all encompassing and we said forget about whether this is a V or U shape, we know that every aspect of our business is going to change in some degree coming out of this. So our customers are going to use our products differently. We know that they're going to shop differently, they're going to spend differently, they're going to pay differently. We know our partners are going to come out of this looking differently, and they'll have different strategies that we need to flex to. And we know that the way that we work together as a team is going to change as well. And so we looked in really those three broad buckets and we said, okay, we need to have a really good strategic plan and a vision around each one of those to that we emerge from this as strong as possible. And I think as we kind of move through that work we will obviously share more in the future. Sanjay Sakhrani : And I guess just a follow-up -- just a follow-up on that is the conclusion that the cost base might not need to be realigned a little bit lower, given some of the challenges your retailers might have? Margaret Keane : No, we will definitely have to realign our cost base. I think we just, we\u2019re trying to see what this -- we want to get a little more feeling for how this comes out. But one thing that we and we just, we did that with the departure of Walmart, we know how to adjust the cost base, we've froze jobs, so we're not hiring anybody right now. We've done all those kinds of actions already out of the gate. Obviously, we're saving on some of the things like travel and things like that. But if we have to reset the cost base of the business as we come out of this because we're smaller, we will do that. And we have our eye on that ball. That's a little bit of some of the work streams Brian even has on his list. So -- Brian Wenzel : Sanjay, this is Brian. So let me just kind of put a bow on where you had started, right. So your first question on Verizon and Venmo, the timing really hasn't shifted that much when you think about the cost associated with those two. And I know we highlighted to be $0.20 a share for the year. The marketing research costs, the launch costs, the development costs to develop all the in-app capabilities for let's say, Venmo, that also has to occur, right, the shifting of the programs and the reserves which was a component of that cost isn't that significant now. As Margaret said, we'll see how the current environment and whether or not there is a more material shift in that and we will obviously provide transparency as we get to our call in July. So with regard to -- we have started, there isn't really a change from, I think the guidance that we provided earlier in the year. Second, just to highlight what Margaret said obviously the development of the retail landscape, the development of the consumer, once we have more transparency to that, obviously, we'll look to maintain the same type of efficiency. And we'll work through that as obviously there are large portions that are variable. But obviously, we may take action on the fixed costs part of the business in order to rightsize it, so that's how I would think about it. Sanjay Sakhrani : That's perfect. I'm sorry, one last question, because I'm being asked this question quite a bit, capital ratios, dividend sustainability, sort of how are you guys thinking about it? Obviously, Brian Wenzel, you talked about the balance sheet shrinking? How should we think about capital free-up to the extent that were even to occur, does that qualify as sort of excess capital and therefore it provides a cushion or maybe could you just walk us through the discussions you're having with regulators? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes, sure. So with a capital position, capital is something that we've come out from our separation from GE as a strength. We came out with a higher capital ratio, CET-1 capital ratio, then we probably needed but we need to demonstrate our ability to stand up as a separate public company and withstand events like this. So our ultimate goal was really to migrate our capital ratios down to that of our peers, that has not changed through this. We feel as we start into this economic period that we have a significant amount of capital to weather the storm. Obviously, the CECL transition helps as well. But we'll continue to migrate that that capital down to peer levels over time. With regard to your second question around the dividend. Obviously, the dividend is important to us as we think about the business and really the PP&R resiliency of the business. We believe that we can continue to generate capital as we think about our priorities for the use of capital is really the growth of our existing programs, number one. The second really is the dividend. And as we sit here today, we believe we're going to continue to pay that dividend based upon the current environment and based upon our forecasts that we have the financial strength, the capital liquidity to continue to do that. And that's a high priority for us and then as you move through obviously, then it would be share repurchases and then down the road, whether it's portfolio acquisitions or M&A. But from a dividend perspective again given the current environment and our assessment, we're committed to pay that dividend. Greg Ketron : Thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn it over to Greg Ketron. You may begin sir. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause the actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the Company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Margaret Keane, Brian Wenzel, and Brian Doubles. I will now turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks Greg. Good morning, everyone. When we last spoke the world was facing a global crisis and broad economic disruption. Sadly, while we saw some bright spots and again reopening here in the U.S. we\u2019ve seen a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus causing continued disruption to our lives, businesses and economy.  In addition, following more senseless loss of life within the black community, our country is awakening to the need to meaningfully address racial injustice and equality. Both challenges are difficult, emotional and take hard work to address. I am proud of how Synchrony continues to successfully manage through these extraordinarily challenging times. Our decisions are guided by putting people first. With COVID, we are focused on the health and safety of our employees and their families, providing support for our customers, and helping our partners get back up and running.  In the fight for equality, we are implementing new actions to increase diverse employee talent at all levels, grow business relationships with diversified and small businesses, investing in diverse markets, and working with our partners, customers and employees to address deeply rooted gender and racial inequality.  With our values as our guide, we are resolute in addressing these challenges and emerging a better company and country.  Now I will turn to the second quarter results on Slide 3. Earnings were $48 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the CECL implementation this year, which was $483 million or $365 million after tax and reduced EPS by $0.63.  The pandemic has impacted results this quarter. Brian will provide details on the trends later in the call and I will provide a high-level overview here.  On a core basis which excludes Walmart and Yamaha portfolio, the impact of COVID-19 drove a 3% decrease in loan receivables, a 7% decrease in interest and fees a 13% decrease in purchase volume and a 5% decrease in average active accounts. The efficiency ratio was 36.3% for the quarter.  As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy, in response to the COVID-19 impact in our balance sheet, deposits were down $1.5 billion or 2% versus last year. This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth, given the excess liquidity we have. We have held direct deposits at last year\u2019s level of $53 billion. Our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source and we will continue to focus assets to make our bank attractive to depositors. As we navigate the day-to-day of this new environment in which we all find ourselves, we are also acutely focused on the future of our business.  During the quarter, we expanded several programs and added new partnerships, which you can see on the slide. We also executed a successful launch of the new Verizon program. We are very proud of this program and we work closely with Verizon to create a unique, robust rewards program for their customers that use simple and easy tools to apply, buy and service the Verizon Visa cards.  This card includes a compelling value proposition giving consumer wireless customers the ability to save on their monthly Verizon bills through rewards or on everyday purchases and freedom to use those rewards for its Verizon purchases including bill payment and latest phones and accessories. For that, the Verizon Visa card is truly responsive to what consumers right now, a contactless, frictionless and digital-first experience. We are alsoexcited about our new program with Venmo and continue to partner with them to launch their new programs, which we anticipate will occur later this year. During the quarter, we also returned $128 million in capital through common stock dividends.  We are pleased with the strength of our business and we are well positioned to continue to help our cardholders and partners navigate through these challenging times. We continue to remain highly focused on digital innovation, accelerating our data analytics capabilities and creating frictionless customer experiences which are key to the success of our programs and winning new partnerships. I am going to turn the call over to Brian Doubles to discuss some of the key highlights in this area. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Margaret. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the digital transformation has been well underway for a number of years now and in many cases the pandemic has accelerated these trends that were already in motion. It\u2019 clear that many of these new trends and our consumer behaviors will be permanent and there will be a new normal, specifically as it relates to the digital shopping experience and consumers\u2019 increasing demand for contactless commerce and payment options.  Studies indicate that consumers are changing their shopping behavior and contactless payments is becoming increasingly important as indicated by the data on the slide. The fact that consumers are seeking and rapidly adopting contactless solutions is creating greater demand for our partners to deliver safe and efficient contactless experiences.  We are well positioned to address these changing behaviors and have quickly responded to this need with dedicated resources and investments to support our partners and cardholders during this time of rapid change.  As you know, we have been investing in our digital assets and capabilities and we quickly recognized in the early days of the pandemic that we will need to move even quicker to help support our partners and help them accelerate their digital transformation. We quickly reviewed every strategic project in the business and reallocated resources and agile teams to accelerate our efforts on key digital initiatives. We believe we are uniquely positioned to meet this moment and its lasting effects. Data shows that the vast majority of consumers plan to stick with their digital behavior beyond the pandemic and we are prepared to help our partners position for the new reality of today and into the future. Driving digital sales penetration continues to be a key to our success with both existing partners and with our newer programs.  In retail cards, digital sales penetration was 48% in the second quarter and digital applications were approximately 70% of our total applications, 14 percentage points higher than last quarter. The mobile channel alone grew 43%, compared to the same quarter last year excluding Walmart.  Further, more than 60% of total payments made on our cardholders\u2019 accounts are done digitally. We continue to provide partners and customers with increased digital options from applying on their own devices, provisioning a new card into their digital wallet, transacting with contactless cards and making payments, we believe customers will continue to adapt to what makes them more comfortable.  Many of our partners have been with us for decades. We have been there to help them grow their businesses and we are now here to help them adapt to the challenges in the new environment. We are accelerating our efforts to provide our partners and their customers with innovative services and products they can use during this time of disruption.  Our investments in our digital assets have proven extremely valuable in helping them to serve their customers and drive sales. This is a testament to our agile structure which is helping to deliver real-time solutions and our dedicated teams who are tirelessly working to support our partners and their customers.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian Wenzel. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Allow me to briefly echo what Margaret said earlier about the dual crisis facing our nation. We are determined to keep our employees safe, and help our partners and customers be successful during this time. We\u2019ve been more committed to driving meaningful change in the fight for racial equality inside our company and in the communities which we serve and live.  With a backdrop of unprecedented uncertainty and volatility, I had never been proud our company and our people, the values we live by and our commitment to inclusion that is the heart of who we are.  Now turning to our financial results for the second quarter. I'll start on Slide 5 of the presentation. First, I want to cover some of the trends we are seeing from the impact of COVID-19 from a purchase volume standpoint, and so as important to provide an update on performance of accounts who received forbearance. Slide 5 shows year-over-year purchase volume growth for the total company for the quarter, as well as purchase volume by sales platform dating back to January. Purchase volume growth was strong for the total company and by platform with double-digit growth from January through mid-March.  In the second half of March, as government restrictions increased, travel, entertainment and event activity were significantly curtailed and a high number of non-essential retail stores closed. There was also a significant curtailment of elective healthcare services. As a result, purchase volume declined significantly, decreasing as much as 31% in the first half of April for the total company. In looking at the full month of April by sales platform, retail card declined 21%, Payment Solutions declined 41% and CareCredit declined 60%. CareCredit was impacted the most with the significant decrease in spending for elective and planned procedures in dental and medical services during this period.  Retail card performed better due to higher concentration of the digital volume, as well as having programs that benefited from an increase in spending for essential products such as grocery, supplies and home-related expenditures.  As consumers became more comfortable on their stay at home orders and initial reopening phases in May and June occurred, we saw a recovery in purchase volume as we moved through the second quarter. In the second half of June, overall purchase volume increased 3% over the prior year and each of the three sales platforms saw a significant recovery in purchase volume from the April trough. Looking to some of the other key business drivers for the quarter, new accounts declined 36%, and purchase volume by account declined 8% reflecting the impact of the crisis as well as underwriting actions we took as the pandemic\u2019s impact progressed through the quarter.  We did see a 4% increase in the average balance per account due to a combination of portfolio mix from our digital and retail partners, as well as lower than usual volume in new accounts. While we are encouraged by these trends, there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty which lies ahead when the stimulus measures and industry-wide forbearance actions abate. However, our business mix, including a strong digital component, as well as diversification in segments being positioned to benefit from spend in areas such as home-related expenditures, as well as veterinary services will likely dampen some of the effects of the economic downturn. The ultimate impact is still largely uncertain given the duration and magnitude of the pandemic is still largely unknown at this point. Moving to Slide 6, we highlight the impact and performance of accounts that were granted forbearance compared to accounts not in forbearance. Through June 30, we\u2019ve granted forbearance to a cumulative total of approximately 1.7 million accounts or a $3.2 billion in account balances at the time of forbearance.  We have seen nearly 70% of these accounts leave forbearance through June 30 bringing approximately 500,000 accounts or $1.1 billion in account balances remaining in forbearance.  Through mid-July, these numbers have been relatively stable. Of the accounts that are enrolled in forbearance, 92% were either current or less than 30 days past due, so a relatively small number of accounts for 30 plus days past due. When you look at some of the performance characteristics, you will see trends that are not surprising. Credit line utilization is higher and payment rates are lower.  In terms of impact on financial performance, in total, we have weighed $47 million in APs and $20 million in interest through the end of the second quarter. From a trend perspective, we are seeing a substantial decline in the number of accounts enrolling in forbearance from a peak in late March to early April, where we saw nearly 40,000 accounts enrolling per day, this dropped to less than 10,000 per day in June. payments, bringing: From a credit perspective, 56% of the enrollees had a FICO score of 660 or below at the time of enrollment. For accounts that have exited the forbearance program, their credit performance is slightly worse than other similar accounts. Accounts on forbearance have a three times increase in the entry rate into delinquency.  However, given the limited time the accounts have been on forbearance is not clear at this point how those accounts will ultimately perform in delinquency. It should be noted that while the performance is generally weaker than similar accounts, it has not had a material impact on our 30 plus delinquency measures, which improved during the second quarter. forbearance and stay in rate to : Moving to the second quarter financial results on Slide 7. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $48 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the implementation of CECL this year. The increase was $483 million or $365 million after tax, which reduced EPS by $0.63. COVID-19 impacted our growth in several areas as noted on Slide 8. On a core basis, which excludes the Walmart and Yamaha portfolios, loan receivables were down 3% and interest and fees on loan were down 7%. On a core basis, purchase volume was down 13% and average active accounts were down 5% from last year.  On Slide 7 we have included dual and co-branded card purchase volumes and loan receivable balances to provide the level of diversification we have through these products. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 34% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and declined 22% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and declined 4% from the prior year.  As I noted earlier, the impact of COVID-19 accelerated as we moved through March and April, but we did see some encouraging signs in these metrics as we moved through May and June. We would also note that while we are seeing positive trending in these metrics, the duration and the magnitude of the pandemic is still largely unknown and remains difficult to provide a more precise forecast of the impact at this point.  RSAs decreased $86 million or 10% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.0% for the quarter, starting to reflect the impact of COVID-19 is having on the program performance. The provision for credit losses increased $475 million or 40% from last year.  The increase is primarily driven by the reserve increased for the projected impact of COVID-19-related losses and a prior year reserve reduction related to Walmart that totaled $247 million. The reserve build for the second quarter was $627 million and largely due to the projected impact of COVID-19-related losses. Other income increased $5 million. Other expense was down $73 million or 7% primarily due to the cost reductions from the Walmart sale, the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced during the quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend.  These decreases were partially offset by higher operational losses, expenses related to our COVID-19 response and charitable contributions.  Moving to our platform results on Slide 9. As I noted earlier, the sales platform were impacted by varying degrees due to COVID-19. In retail card, core loan receivables were down 4% with the COVID-19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in our digital programs. Other metrics were down, driven by the sales of Walmart portfolio and the impact from COVID-19.  Although Payment Solutions was impacted by COVID-19 strength in power sports resulted in core loan receivables growth of 1%. Interest and fees on loans decreased 8%, driven primarily by lower late fees. Purchase volumes decreased 19% and average active accounts decreased 3%. We signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter as noted on Slide 3.  We continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added close to 4,000 new merchants during the quarter. These networks, along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 30% of purchase volume excluding oil and gas continue to build a solid base of business for the future.  CareCredit was impacted the most by COVID-19 in the second quarter, but as I noted earlier, we did see some encouraging sign in the trends as the quarter progressed as providers began to provide discretionary and planned services. Receivables declined 5% and we did see growth in veterinary specialties that partially offset the negative impact of COVID-19.  Interest and fees on loans decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower merchant discount, as a result of the decline in purchase volume, which was down 31%. Average active accounts decreased 2%. We continue to expand our CareCredit networks and the utility of our card as we added over 2,000 new provider locations to our network during this quarter.  The network expansion has helped to drive the reuse rate to 60% of purchased volume in the second quarter. I\u2019ll move to Slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 18% from last year, primarily driven by an 18% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the Walmart portfolio, the impact of COVID-19 and lower benchmark rates. On a core basis, interest and fees on loan receivables decreased 7%.  The net interest margin was 13.53%, compared to last year\u2019s margin of 15.75%, largely driven by the impact of COVID-19 on receivables and increasing liquidity, fee and interest waivers and lower benchmark rates.  The loan receivables mix, as a percent of total earnings assets mix declined from 83.9% to 78% driven by the higher liquidity during the quarter. This accounted for a 113 basis points of the net interest margin decline.  The impact of fee and interest waivers from forbearance that I noted earlier, accounted for 24 basis points of the net interest margin decline, a decline in loan receivables yield, primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of the Walmart portfolio. This accounted for 101 basis points of the reduction in our net interest margin. The investment in securities yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 32 basis points of net interest margin decline.  These impacts were partially offset by a 58 basis point decrease in total interest-bearing liabilities cost of 2.15%, primarily due to the lower benchmark rates and lower deposit pricing. This provided a 48 basis point benefit to our net interest margin.  Next, I will cover key credit trends on Slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I\u2019ll start with our delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 3.13%, compared to 4.43% last year and the 90 plus delinquency rate was 1.77%, compared to 2.16% last year.  If you exclude the impact of the Walmart portfolio, the 30 plus delinquency rate was down approximately 90 basis points and a 90 plus delinquency rate was down approximately 10 basis points, compared to last year. Focusing on net charge-off trends. The net charge-off rate was 5.35%, compared to 6.01% last year. The reduction in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the Walmart sale and improving credit trends. Excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio, the net charge-off rate was approximately 20 basis points lower than last year.  The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.52%, post CECL implementation. Excluding the effects of CECL, the allowance under the A000 method would have been 7.91%. The reserve build in the second quarter was $627 million under CECL and $144 million under the A000 method.  The overall reserve provisioning was higher than expected due to the impact of COVID-19, which accounted for most of the reserve build in the second quarter.  In summary, the second quarter trends continue to be solid, forbearance providing a degree of benefit in delinquency trends, we do expect the overall credit trends will be impacted by COVID-19 as we move forward.  Moving to Slide 12, I\u2019ll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were down $73 million or 7% from last year to slightly under $1 million for the quarter. The decline was driven mainly by the cost reductions from Walmart, the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced during the quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend.  This was partially offset by higher expenses attributable to operational losses and certain expenditures related to our response to COVID-19. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 31.3% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by higher expenses attributable to operational losses, certain expenses related to our response to COVID-19 and charitable contributions. Excluding those impacts, the efficiency ratio would have been 260 basis points lower or approximately 33.7%.  Moving to Slide 13. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continue to build liquidity during the second quarter. While we think it is prudent to have higher liquidity levels given the level of uncertainty and volatility, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined $1.5 billion, compared to last year. We also reduced the size of our securitized and unsecured funding sources by $3.9 billion and $1.3 million respectively. This puts deposits at 80% of our funding compared to 75% last year with securitized and unsecured funding each comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end.  While we slowed overall deposit growth in the second quarter, given our excess liquidity, we held direct deposit at last year\u2019s level of $53 billion. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $28.0 billion, which equated to 29% of our assets. This is up from 22% last year.  Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we're electing to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in March, which has two primary benefits.  First, it delays the effects of a transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, allows for the portion of the current period provisioning under CECL to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the first quarter at 15.3% CET-1 under the CECL transition rules, 100 basis points above last year\u2019s level of 14.3%.  The Tier-1 capital ratio is 16.3% under the CECL transition rules, compared to 14.3% last year reflecting the preferred stock issuance last November. The total capital ratio increased 200 basis points as well to 17.6% also reflecting the preferred issuance. And the Tier-1 capital ratio, plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 26.5%, compared to 20.8% last year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing CECL and the preferred stock issuance. During the quarter, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. Last quarter, we announced that given the current economic uncertainty, and being as prudent as possible, we made the decision to halt further share repurchases, so we have greater visibility on the magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 will ultimately have on the economic environment. We will continue to evaluate this as we move forward. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and operating with strong capital and liquidity levels. In closing, given the number of uncertainties that exists regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the countering impacts of actions such as the CARES Act, payment assistance for consumers, and other government and regulatory actions may have remains very difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this time to provide specifics around key outlook drivers.  As we did last quarter, I want to provide a framework to help you consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers. Regarding loan receivables growth, COVID-19 had a significant impact on purchase volume, particularly late in the first quarter and into the second quarter and then as businesses reopened, we saw positives turning and improvement in purchase volume. As long as businesses remain open, we expect this trend to continue, but the increase in COVID-19 effects as we are seeing nationally and the responses to this will influence whether the recovery continues it may result in further volatility as we move forward. What continues to help our trends and resiliency is the growth in digital, diversity inside our platforms, and financing in essential areas such as home and healthcare.  We will continue leveraging our capabilities and expertise to help our partners and providers during this difficult period. This overall direction in purchase volume will be a key influence in our receivable growth rate.  Our net interest margin has been impacted by a number of factors including the buildup of liquidity on our balance sheet and reduction in the size of our receivables, the reduction in benchmark rates resulting from FED rate cuts on our receivables and investment security yields. And impact of forbearance in terms of interest and fee waivers for a temporary period of time.  As we move forward, we will continue to look at means to deploy our excess liquidity and impact of forbearance should it be. We do expect to benefit to net interest margin, and higher interest income and fees generated from an increase in the number of accounts that will evolve in our loan receivable portfolio and continued lower interest expense.  Finally, it should be noted we also share the impact on revenues and funding costs through the RSA. Regarding RSAs, in addition to sharing the net interest income impacts, we'll also see an impact from higher credit costs. The ultimate amount of the credit cost impact and timing will be determined somewhat by the expected deterioration in credit as stimulus actions and industry-wide forbearance assistance abates.  While we expect an increase in net charge-off rate as the year progresses, it should be noted that the overall portfolio quality and credit trends as we entered this pandemic are strong and continued to improve in the second quarter. Also, the tools and capabilities that we have highlighted previously will help us better navigate the economic impacts from COVID-19.  Finally, we also believe higher recoveries will ultimately materialize partially mitigating the impact of higher losses. While we continue to expect the reserve builds to be elevated as we move forward, until we gain more visibility into the duration and severity of the current pandemic, and the impacts from stimulus and industry-wide forbearance, we cannot provide more specific guidance. Once we have greater visibility, we'll be in a better position to define the expected net charge-off and reserve build expectations going forward. Regarding the efficiency ratio, activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels and we will look to mitigate some of the impacts through expense reduction opportunities. We have undertaken a comprehensive review of our operating expense base and are formulating a set of actions to right-size our operating expense as a result of the reduction and mix in our loan receivable portfolio.  Fundamentally, the business remains strong and is resilient and we are going through this situation with a strong balance sheet, capital, and liquidity position. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. As we have said, the ultimate impact from this crisis remains difficult to quantify right now. So I will reiterate that we believe we have an advantageous position to navigate this unprecedented pandemic.  We are well positioned from a credit perspective given changes we have made since the financial crisis in addition to some of the more surgical modifications we\u2019ve made in recent years and that we continue to make considering the current operating environment. We have a partner-centric business model and agile approach to all our operations and investments.  Our digital capabilities and asses has helped us win important digital partners and our another vital tool to help our partnership fall into online and mobile channels. We are focused on execution today with an eye towards the future, making investments, building capabilities, launching programs and making the fundamental changes necessary to emerge from this pandemic in a stronger position.  Thank you for participating on the call today. And I hope you and your family stay healthy and safe. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A. Greg Ketron : That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from KBW, we have Sanjay Sakhrani. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I am glad you guys are doing well. I guess, my first question is on pre-provision earnings. I know there is a lot of things that Brian Wenzel, you laid out, but as we think about loan growth understanding it\u2019s a little bit of moving target, but the purchase volume stats are encouraging.  How should we think about pre-provision earnings going forward? Was the second quarter a trough, or do you think that there is more pressure ahead? Brian Wenzel : Yes, great. Good morning, Sanjay. So, first, if you start out with volume, again, we saw positive trends as we move through the quarter from troughing in the early part of April through a plus 3% in end part of June, I\u2019d say, as we moved into July, we are probably about a negative 2% which kind of reflects some of the uncertainty and volatility.  But I would say, right now, it\u2019s generally in the plus or minus 2% to 3% and we think about that trend really as a bit uncertain as we move through the quarter and how the pandemic and the effects on the economy move forward.  Payment rate has continued to be strong, but obviously, as you think about that from a stimulus perspective and an industry-wide forbearance perspective, they may burn off here which will ultimately hopefully bring down the payment rate.  So, as we think about receivable growth, it is a little bit uncertain as we have multiple factors going different ways. If you think about the margin of the business, really we think this is probably a trough as receivables have moved down close to $5 billion sequentially quarter-to-quarter. We try to burn off as much as that liquidity as we can. We\u2019ll continue to try to burn that off.  So the impact that we saw in the quarter which was just from the higher liquidity, the 113 basis points, that should begin to burn off here in the third quarter and again as we move through into the fourth quarter and it\u2019s really next year, the forbearance impact of 24 basis points shouldn\u2019t for the most part be burned off here in the third quarter now.  So, I think from a margin perspective, we\u2019ve kind of hit that bottom and we\u2019ll trend up from there. With regard to credit, obviously, we\u2019ve been strong in credit. Delinquencies are 90 basis points better ex Walmart. They haven\u2019t really been impacted on forbearance and we could talk about that later, but forbearance hasn\u2019t had that impact. It\u2019s really when we start to see those trends move through.  So I think from a charge-off perspective, we don\u2019t expect to see charge-offs really rise here, maybe in the latter part of 2020, but more into the first half of 2021. The expenses, we are going to again continue to really take an active approach to manage some of the discretionary expenses.  As I outlined in our prepared remarks, we are taking a comprehensive review of expenses and really looking more structural things in order to get more cost out really to reflect the change in the platforms as a percent of mix, in our portfolio mix.  So we would expect to come back with the source of actions that we can really undertake in the latter part 2020 into 2021 to reduce the expenses and get that efficiency ratio back to where it would normally run. So, again, I think there is some positives here coming out, but more certainly, the uncertainty relative to purchase volume and really payment behavior patterns are the key for us in the back half of the year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. And then, my follow-up questions on the reserve builds. I think I heard you, Brian, say that, it\u2019s a little bit of a moving target still in terms of the credit quality migration going forward. But, as we think about reserve builds under a macro assumption that you\u2019ve used, do you feel like you are comfortable with the build that you\u2019ve done and provide nothing changes on that macro assumption.  You don\u2019t expect future reserve builds? Maybe you could just talk about that macro assumption too. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Sure. Sure. Let me start with the macro assumptions, Sanjay. So we \u2013 we run multiple economic scenarios and really formulate a base case and then we have a couple of downside scenarios and what I\u2019d say is an upside scenario. So, to just ground ourselves, when we looked at the first quarter, we used a model that essentially had unemployment peaking in the second quarter around 10%. But again, as I said the important parts are really where you exit 2021 and 2022 where we had our employment really at the end of 27% and then 4.5% in 2022. Obviously, if you look at assumption today, they have deteriorated from that March 31st date. So what we have done is, we stepped off and we took the Moody\u2019s baseline model as our starting point.  Even though they did some revisions in June and July that were slightly positive that we stay with the Moody\u2019s baseline. And then effectively, what we did is, we modeled on to that unemployment. We essentially redistributed unemployment to take into account, forbearance to take in account stimulus.  So, at the end of the year, when you think about our unemployment exiting 2020 it\u2019s 11.5%, 9.3% in 2021 and 6.4% in 2022 and we don\u2019t really get back to an unemployment rate under 5% until 2023. So, I think as you think about how we thought about the macroeconomic environment, we thought about a slower recovery with potentially a greater impact on unemployment.  The key thing for us will be how that unemployment really develops and whether or not you see a greater, what I would call higher income unemployment come into the mix later in the year as you move maybe out some lower income people. So that will be a variable. As you think about the reserve build, then it really comes down to \u2013 for us, a platform mix, because obviously, we have platforms that attract the higher CECL reserve in CareCredit and Payment Solutions.  So, some of this is going to be mix related. So, under CECL, we expect the reserves to be elevated on a normal basis. So, again, I think we\u2019ve taken the best guess in the macroeconomic environment as it stands today. But it\u2019s really going to go back into delinquency formation, and loss formation as we exit 2020. Sanjay Sakhrani : Alright. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Sanjay. Have a good day. Operator : From Credit Suisse, we have Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. And I was hoping maybe just starting you could just talk a little bit about, you had mentioned, Margaret, the partner-centric strategy and how that might impact the second half of the year?  You\u2019ve launched the Verizon cards. You\u2019ve got kind of Venmo and how should we think about what Brian was talking about in terms of kind of volume levels currently with that partner-centric activity in the second half? Margaret Keane : Yes. So I\u2019d say, there is really three parts, right. The retail card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. I\u2019d say, in each case, each platforms operating fairly well. We\u2019ve really tried to stay highly engaged and close to our partners throughout this process. So, as we mentioned, we were able to launch Verizon which, I joke here around with the first launch in a pandemic. That launch went extraordinarily smooth in terms of the execution of the launch.  Now obviously, Verizon is still working through how they open all their stores. So, what Brian talked to earlier about our ability to be fully digital, I think it was a big win for us, because we\u2019ve been able to launch and have a successful launch and feel good about the program and its growth trajectory given the environment we are in right now.  I\u2019d say on Venmo, there is a lot of work going on. Obviously, we\u2019ve had to switch to everything being agile and virtual and that process has really been phenomenal and the teams are executing that plan and as you know, in both cases we are really trying to make this experience a fully digital, integrated experience for the consumer, which I think lessens the burden on brick and mortar as we continue to fluctuate between, what\u2019s open and what\u2019s closed. So we feel positive about that. And in trying that, we are originating the right accounts. We\u2019ve put a lot of work into the front-end of our business on fraud, because that is one area that, I think everyone in the business is seeing a lot of pressure on and we feel good about the tools and techniques that we\u2019ve been able to put in place to really launch this program.  So, that\u2019s really on the retail card side. I\u2019d say on Payment Solutions and CareCredit, couple of things. We are working very closely with these partners. We actually held a number of seminars and halts particularly in our CareCredit business helping the offices reopen we\u2019ve shared our plans. We had the folks that are working on the reopening of our offices, although we haven\u2019t reopened any yet.  Part of the things that we have put in place, the procedures, and so, what we are trying to do is integrate in such a way that we are helping them deal with the pressure they have to deal with as they come back online, as well as ensuring that we are providing them with additional tools that they are going to need as they shift from totally brick and mortar to more online, particularly in our Payment Solution platform.  We have a whole team there working on a new digital POS for that platform which we think will be a big win as we end the year, beginning of next year. So, one of the things we\u2019ve done is set back strategically and really look at what we were working on.  And really have doubled down really across the whole digital aspects of our business to ensure both digitally and from a data perspective we are helping those partners as they continue to reopen and deal with some of the ins and outs of closing and opening and making sure we can deliver from a digital perspective for their consumers. So, highly integrated, lots of conversations, and feeling really good about our performance so far. Brian Wenzel : Yes, Moshe, the only thing I\u2019d add in the CareCredit platform, we have exciting announcement of Advent Health.  So, when you look at the health systems component, not only do we have in our Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic, Advent, the ability to get into the path there and to really help our consumers as they manage their medical bills in this point time is terrific and we are building a really different type of network in that business and working closely with them in order to get that up and running with a handful of other really good health systems across the country. Margaret Keane : I\u2019d say, what\u2019s been amazing as the teams were able to execute these deals in the middle of the pandemic when many of these institutions are having a lot of challenges themselves. So, that goes to the show the relationships that we\u2019ve felt pretty in our credibility in the industry so far of us being able to engage at that level during this period. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. It sounds like you\u2019ve become more important to them. Brian, just a quick follow-up on the reserving question from before. 12.5%, I mean, the average life of your portfolio was something in the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s shrunk in this period, but you used to think it was like 1.7 or 1.8 years. Can we infer anything in terms of where you might be thinking P plus rates would be in 2021 as a result of that 12.5% reserve? Brian Wenzel : Yes, Moshe, I think, it is very difficult to kind of refer that rate, because we haven\u2019t seen any of the trended data really come through and it\u2019s going to really dictate where we see some of the pressure build and certainly when you think about our CareCredit and Payment Solutions, those are longer dated assets with promotional financing.  Obviously, we can control the origination on the front-end of that, but that book will take a longer period of time. I think the positive thing is that if you look at the retail card book, obviously, we guided it the Walmart portfolio which has a higher loss content and really have gotten into, what I\u2019d say is some faster growing, more stable portfolio.  And I think when you look at the FICO mix, our FICO mix for the first quarter now, on a sub-660 basis is 300 basis points better at only 24% that total. So, we feel good about where we are. I think hopefully, we use the macroeconomic assumptions that are hopefully the worst case. But again, we will continue to monitor those as we move forward.  So, until we see some of that trended data and the delinquency formation happen, it is a little bit tough to give you that guidance for 2021 at this point. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Thank you very much. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : From Jefferies, we have John Hecht. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, Brian, I think you mentioned that, and tell me if I am wrong that the actual purchase volume on the digital channel in Q2 was up year-over-year. A, did I hear that right?  And second, maybe within that channel, can you talk about the key influencing factors, I mean, is most of this coming from e-commerce platforms like Amazon and PayPal or is that more distributed? Maybe just a little bit of color on that. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure. This is Brian Doubles. Why don\u2019t I start on that? The online sales penetration rate in retail card was 48% and just to give you a little bit of historical perspective, that was running in the mid-20% range just a couple of years ago. So, we feel really good about that growth. The national average for e-commerce sales typically has been running in that 15% to 20% range. So that gives you a good basis to comparison. So, I definitely feel like we are overindexing in that channel. I think it is broader certainly, this year than just Amazon and PayPal. When I think about the pandemic, really this is just accelerated a digital transformation that was already underway. So, as Margaret kind of highlighted, what we did very early in the process, is we went through every strategic project in the business. And we said okay, how can we best support our partners by helping them accelerate their digital transformation. So we went project-by-project. We redeployed agile teams. We worked with all of our partners, big partners, small partners, providers and CareCredit to help figure out how we could best support them.  So, we put more resources, more investments, shifted things around to things like digital apply, digital buy, accelerating a lot of projects that were already in place. So, it is more broad based and then just the fact that we\u2019ve been trying to engage more and win more programs in the digital-only space. We are really helping our omni-channel partners transform their businesses and figure out how we can best support them in that transformation. John Hecht : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And then, Brian Wenzel, the \u2013 I guess, another follow-up question on the provisioning. I am just trying to kind of determine if we can understand, maybe your perception of the different risk factors tied to those seeking deferrals versus those who haven\u2019t.  And with that, is there a way that you could discuss the provision this quarter, maybe how much of it was a specific provision for the cohort that had sought deferrals versus a general provision, just tied to uncertainty and risk in the overall environment? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Great, John. So, let me start with the forbearance impact. I think tried to give you some color really with regard to the accounts that went into forbearance. So the accounts entering only 8% were delinquent at the time they went into forbearance and while they had higher credit line utilization and payment rate, what we have seen is, as they come off forbearance, and they performed a little bit worse since then their kind of cohorts in the portfolio, but not dramatically worse.  So, they have roughly a three times entry into delinquency. But when you look at the accounts that come off forbearance and look at the amount that\u2019s already in our delinquency, less than six basis points is in delinquency today relating to accounts that were in forbearance and if you took that whole 8% and roll that through, it\u2019s less than 20 basis points.  So forbearance has not had an impact for the $2 billion that has rolled out at this point. Obviously, we\u2019ll have to see how that develops. We are in the early stages with those accounts, really performing off of the program. But we are encouraged by the number of people that, the 8% that\u2019s paid in full and the 61% that are continuing to make payments. So, I think forbearance for us clearly has benefited our cardholders.  What\u2019s unknown to us is, is the forbearance they are receiving in total from industry-wide participants. So that will be an effect. So, as you think about the reserve provisioning in the quarter, the vast majority of this is the deterioration of the macroeconomic assumptions that we put into our model. There were some qualitative that we put out for forbearance, but it\u2019s not a large part of the reserve builds. John Hecht : Okay. Really appreciate the details. Thanks guys. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Have a good day. Margaret Keane : Good day. Operator : From Morgan Stanley, we have Betsy Graseck. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Brian Wenzel : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Just a question on RSA, as we\u2019re thinking about the back half of the year. I think in the past you had given some expectations for how we should be thinking about the RSA in the second half versus the first half. And wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see the drivers there as we go into 2H? Brian Wenzel : Sure, Betsy. So, obviously, we haven\u2019t provided any specific guidance, mainly because some of the unknown is really related to credit. But as I think about a framework how should think about the RSA back half of this year and really into 2021, the first is the program performance.  So, how the long receivables really developed here and more importantly, how the net interest margin kind of comes back and how it develops as you begin to see delinquency developing obviously our partner share in that that revenue side of the equation. Obviously, credit cost will factor in more likely in 2021.  So you will see probably an increased benefit continue in the back half of the year from a net credit write-off perspective through the RSA. As you think about the reserve provisioning, which is probably the larger wildcard here, unfortunately, what you see is, first of all a platform mix issue, right, so.  So far we have booked probably more of the CECL benefit really sitting in CareCredit and Payment Solutions given they attract a higher CECL reserve provisioning given the length and nature of those assets.  Inside the retail card portfolio, it\u2019s ultimately going to come down to the mix of partners that flow in there. As we know, you have some partners that share in the reserves, some partners that don\u2019t share in the reserve. And unfortunately as we sit here today, we are just making estimates with regard to how the delinquency formation works and how that will go into the loss content as we build into 2021.  So they are some variable pieces here. So, I think there is a little bit of timing where the impact to the RSA may be delayed. But we really have to see where those two move from a reserve perspective, but again, we hope to be moving forward on a NIM perspective and charge-offs to put a little upward pressure on the RSA from just a performance before you think about reserves. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. And then, Margaret, you did a really interesting podcast at the end of May with ICE, and there as well as detailing of how you are thinking on that. And I was just wondering at one point, the question was, how does the pandemic impacts Synchrony and as a part of the answer, you\u2019re talking about being a smaller company.  But I wonder if either there was more detail there around that that you could explain? Or if your view has changed given that maybe between now and the end of May things weren\u2019t as tough, so. Margaret Keane : Yes, I think I was really referring to the fact that, we definitely have seen our assets shrink a bit and as a result of that, it\u2019s what Brian talked about, we are going to have to do a reset of expenses and align ourselves. So that we keep the return of the business in the area that we like.  I think, it\u2019s - like any difficult situation, I think people rise the occasion and we are able to really just step back and say, okay, coming out of this, how do we want to make sure we are set up for the future.  And I think the fact that we\u2019ve been around for 90 years and spent a lot, we are positioned that way. But I think particularly as we move more digital, we are going to have to make sure our resources are aligned to align with that digital transformation that we continue to make. And so, I think we are really looking at all the levers inside our business to ensure things don\u2019t get away from us and that we are really coming out of this in a way that we have the right partners, the right program, the right digital experience and capabilities building out our data that we\u2019ve been continuing to do. And then in trying that, the returns on our business continue to deliver for our shareholders. Brian Wenzel : But the thing I would add and just not to get lost in this, when you think about the sequential decline in average loan receivables, it sound over \u2013 almost $5.7 billion.  So, clearly, we are trying to make sure that we understand where the depth of that could be in that that we react and I think when you think about the efficiency ratio in the quarter, when you strip out more of the \u2013 some of the operational losses in COVID-19 response, we are at a 33 I think .6% efficiency ratio.  So, we want to get that back in line with where we can continue to deliver a higher ROA business. So that\u2019s really what I think is driving it. And hopefully, here we\u2019ll have to see how the sales play out as we move through the back half of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thank you, Betsy. Have a good day. Operator : From Wells Fargo, we have Don Fandetti. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Hi. Good morning. So, Margaret, I guess, is it fair to say you continue to sort of see credit coming in better than expected. It surprised me how resilient that consumer has been and I know we can\u2019t infer too much from your reserve, but, if NCOs are peaking in the first half of 2021, they would suggest an NCO loss rate that\u2019s not significantly higher than where you are in certainly a lot lower than the credit crisis. Do you think it\u2019s stimulus is what\u2019s really doing it and what are your thoughts in the near-term? Margaret Keane : Look, I think, one thing we all know is the consumer going into this was pretty strong, right. So, and I think what we are seeing and we are even seeing this in deposits rate, consumers have more cash, they are hoarding more cash and they are paying their bills. Now, I think the big caveat in all of this, Don, is really what happens with when the stimulus ends which is they won\u2019t have incentive if they don\u2019t come up with a new plan. What is that new stimulus and then how quickly do people get back to work? And I think, that\u2019s the fact that where I have to say I\u2019ve been around the business for forty years. I don\u2019t think any of us would have expected to see what is happening - happening in terms of delinquencies. I think we are kind of a bit surprised and thought there would definitely be more pressure there.  So I think we have to really see the third and fourth quarter to really understand what\u2019s the next phase of stimulus? How does that play out? And I do think we are anticipating more job loss. I think what we\u2019ve seen so far is, the things that are connected to travel, entertainment, restaurants, things like that, but I think, every company is stepping back and looking at their own cost structures and how does that play into it. So, I think we are trying to be cautious about this, because if you just look at how we are doing today, we should be padding ourselves on the back of saying all things look great.  But I think the reality is there is more to come and we just have to be ready for that and that\u2019s really what we are trying to ensure we are doing both from an underwriting perspective, and trying we are reserving properly and then the third area of really taking a hard look at expenses to make sure we are positioned right as we come out of this. Don Fandetti : Got it. Thank you. Margaret Keane : I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you\u2019d add anything? Brian Wenzel : Yes, the only thing I would add, Don, the book is fundamentally different than it was a year ago, more certainly if you work backwards in time with Walmart kind of coming out, when you think about the portfolio, the fact today that we\u2019ll only have 24% of the book below 660 down 300 basis points from the first quarter. Clearly, the effects of stimulus and forbearance \u2013 industry wide forbearance has driven our payment rate. Our payment rate was 15.60 for the quarter up 83 basis points year-over-year. So, people are paying down the debt.  The good news is, because we\u2019ve migrated credit, we are seeing better performance and ultimately, Margaret hit on the point is, as unemployment does develops and you get back to what our estimate will be towards the end of the year is there a fundamental rotation in there that will give you a different outcome.  We are anticipating that. I think we are executing our credit enhancements around that. But again, we\u2019ll have to see how that develops. But I think it goes to a testament to how we modified the book from GFC. And then, really the tools, the data elements are a reason to managing the book today that hopefully drives credit in a fundamentally positive way as we move into this recession. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : From JPMorgan, we have Rich Shane. Please go ahead. Rich Shane : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Look, I want to follow-up on a theme that I think we\u2019ve explored a little bit here. But when we look at the reserve increase versus the change in economic outlook, it almost feels like the correlation is a little bit lower than it\u2019s been historically.  And again, I think you guys have touched upon some of the factors there forbearance, policy initiatives which have dampened that relationship. I am curious if you think that ultimately the risk the duration of the cycle that could drive that correlation back to the historical norm? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Rick. As you think about it, I think the historical norm does have Walmart and it does have some other things. So, you have to almost adjust that the start of it, the strength of the consumer and the change in the underlying portfolio as you look forward. So, most certainly, we are very sensitive to the duration of the impact of it\u2019s more prolonged than we think than most certainly it would be.  But when we look at our stress result team, if you go back to where we published back in 2018, they are better ex Walmart. So, I do think that and I think when you think about this quarter, the fact that we\u2019ve had such a large decrease in our receivables, there is a pretty big volume after. So the rate part of the provision is up significantly in the quarter. So \u2013 but again, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 you hit on it. It\u2019s going to be really how that curve develops out and whether or not just the fundamental mix shift inside the unemployment where we are thinking. Rich Shane : Got it. And then I appreciate. That \u2013 you are right. There is a pretty significant idiosyncratic shift in the portfolio without Walmart that have to be accounted for, as well. Thank you guys. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Rick. Have a good day. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Brandon, and we have time for one more question. Operator : And from Bank of America, we have Mihir Bhatia. Please go ahead. MihirBhatia : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Wanted to quickly just follow-up on the reserve build discussion. You\u2019ve talked on this call about the potential for the unemployment pool to change a bit where you have maybe some higher income consumers lose jobs going forward.  And I just wanted to clarify, does the reserve build already account for this change? Or is this something that you are keeping an eye on that you \u2013 that could happen and you will then need to build reserves for it. I understand the magnitude might be different, but just trying to understand what is already reserved for versus what won\u2019t be. Brian Wenzel : Yes. It\u2019s a great question and I think we\u2019ve tried to model some of that, but ultimately, because we are seeing a strengthening of credit as we move forward and really a strengthening of credit even inside of the credit grades. It\u2019s difficult to ultimately predict that. So we\u2019ve put some level of estimate in. It\u2019s just subject to a lot of uncertainty.  Now there is a lot of \u2013 as we all read, the indications that there are going to be large number of lay-offs n some of these higher income jobs, but until we actually see that, and what builds in our portfolio, it is somewhat difficult. But we put some estimate in for how we think the portfolio performs as we move forward. But that is just a risk factor ultimately how it develops. MihirBhatia : Understood. Thanks. And just one other last question. Just could you maybe just discuss some of the newer programs you\u2019ve launched? And you have one thing of the Synchrony HOME program, the CarCare or maybe in the GP card, how have they performed through the crisis?  And to the extent you are willing to share just in terms of the volume of credit trends and how that compares to the rest of the portfolio or even your expectations, does that change your appetite for wanting to grow those? Just trying to understand how you are thinking about your programs and now that you had a crisis? Margaret Keane : Yes. Now, I think, I\u2019d say, all of them are performing well. We \u2013 they perform no differently than the overall book. I would say, particularly we are seeing a lot of strength in HOME. I am sure many of you have seen that Home seems to be where people are spending their money. And so, we are definitely seeing good take up and people buying furniture, home improvement and alike.  So, both our Home Card and our partners that deal in the Home are definitely seeing a lot of strength. CarCare is a little different in that. The actual car part is fine, but when gas isn\u2019t down, but that\u2019s starting to pick up as people start driving more. But it\u2019s still not to a level of where people were driving pre-pandemic. But I\u2019d day, overall from a credit perspective and origination perspective, and utilization perspective, we feel really good about all of those programs and we\u2019ll continue to look to grow them. MihirBhatia : Okay. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Have a good day. MihirBhatia : You too. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks for joining us this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and we hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Margaret Keane, Brian Wenzel and Brian Doubles. I will now turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. With the global health practice still looming and continued racial injustice, there is a continued disruption to our lives, businesses and the economy. As we continue to respond as a company, we have put people at the forefront of our decision, and I'm extremely proud of our actions to address these crisis. We've made thoughtful forward-looking decisions to support our employees and families, our customers, our partners, our communities and our shareholders. Using agile principles, we have realigned and reimagine the way we work, quickly advancing our most important cultural and business priorities, including the successful launch of two new important programs in the midst of a pandemic. Using safety and maximum flexibility for employees as a backdrop, all of our U.S. employees can now permanently work from home. Doing so has also allowed us to transform our physical footprint. We have reduced the size of some of our sites in closing, other sites entirely.  These changes stemmed from our employees desire to work from home. Their productivity in this environment will help us drive long- efficiency and profitability of our business. As part of this effort, today, we announced a restructuring charge of $89 million in the third quarter, which encompasses our new site footprint strategy. We are also being thoughtful, targeted and aggressive on our cost structure as we move forward, allowing us to continue our focus and investment in future growth. Digital innovation is paramount to the success of our program. Consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless e-commerce, and we are responding to ensure our partners are well positioned for this rapidly evolving dynamic. Deep technology investments have enabled the company to respond quickly to partners and cardholders with resources to help them adapt to the challenges of this new environment. We are providing enhanced, innovative digital solutions for our partners and cardholders, further strengthening our market position. Brian Doubles will cover some of our recent digital innovation shortly. Shifting quickly to change how we are operating our business, where we are allocating capital and making investments is essential to our current and future success. We are confident that these actions and our long-term strategy will make us stronger and even more competitive as manage through the economic cycle caused by the pandemic. I'll now turn specifically to our third quarter results, and some of our recent successes, which are outlined on slide 3. Earnings for $330 million or $0.52 per diluted share, this includes the restructuring charge of $89 million or $67 million after tax which equates to an APS reduction of $0.11. It also includes an increase in provision for credit losses. As a result of the CECL implementation this year, which was $66 million or $50 million after tax which reduced EPS by $0.09. The pandemic have continued to impact results this quarter. Brian Wenzel will provide details on the translator and the call. And I will provide a high level overview here. On a core basis, which excludes Walmart and the Yamaha portfolios, the impact of COVID-19 drove a 5% decrease in loan receivables and a 12% decrease in interest and fees. Purchase volume was flat and average active accounts decreased 8%. The efficiency ratio was 39.7% for the quarter. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet deposits were down 2.5 billion or 4% versus last year. This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth, given the excess liquidity we have. Total deposits comprise 80% of funding, and our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attractive to depositors and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. During the quarter we returned $129 million in capital through common stock dividends. We also extended several programs and added new partnerships, which you can see on the slide. One of our most notable renewals is with Sam's Club. We are very pleased to extend our strategic partnership with a new multi year agreement that builds upon our 25 year credit card relationship. The extension enhances reward and drive incremental value for members and small businesses. And we continue to bridge the digital and physical experiences with innovative payment technologies. We have also successfully launched the Venmo program and Brian doubles will provide more detail shortly. We are pleased with the strength of our business, our ability to win program and launch innovative new products, and our capacity to rapidly adapt to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to help our cardholders and partners, navigate these challenging times. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian Doubles to discuss Venmo, and our accelerating digital and product innovation. Brian Doubles : Thanks Margaret. I will spend a few minutes talking about the exciting launch of our Venmo program. We are pleased to deepen our long standing relationship with PayPal and Venmo with the launch of the first ever Venmo card. The card unlocks new ways for Venmo a community of more than 60 million customers to shop. Share split purchases and earn cashback everywhere VISA credit cards are accepted, together with Venmo our open banking API's offer a seamless payment experience for users, Venmo customers can easily apply, buy and manage their account right inside the Venmo app. Another card enhancement is the inclusion of a personalized QR code on the card itself, which can be scanned with a mobile phone camera to activate the card, or in the Venmo app by friends to send a payment or split purchases. The card also sets a new standard in the industry through its intelligent, auto personalized rewards program. The innovative, dynamic rewards experience maximizes opportunities to earn cashback. Each month customers automatically earn cashback on the categories where they spend the most with the top 10 categories changing based on the customer's monthly spending habits. In addition to many other features that facilitate a seamless contact experience. The Venmo credit card provides customers an easy way to manage their card and spending right in the mobile app. Customers can track activity organized by spending categories, split and share purchases, view cashback status, make payments, configure alerts, manage the credit card and more all in the app. Lastly, we're also delivering a scalable platform that engages customers with real time notifications. At every stage of their experience with our new Venmo program. We are introducing card controls that empower customers to set rules to manage their account in the way that fit them best, including spending limits, geographical limits and credit lines. Adoption of card controls increases loyalty and top of wallet use for our partners and demonstrate Synchrony's social responsibility platform of promoting financial well-being. We brought together the best of both worlds, combining PayPal and Venmo's digital innovation with Synchrony's digital and industry expertise. That makes a difference when it comes to deeply engaging with users, from increasing credit line assignments, to providing more personalized offers, to reducing fraud. PayPal and Venmo continued to transform the payment experience for consumers, and we're proud to be their partner of choice. Next, I will spend a few minutes on our recent digital and product innovation. The digital transformation has been well underway for several years. However, the pandemic has drastically accelerated the adoption of the technology that enables the digital shopping experience, particularly as it relates to the digital integration at the point-of-sale and contactless payment. The fact that consumers are seeking and rapidly adopting contactless solutions is creating greater demand for our partners to deliver safe and efficient shopping experiences, and to provide attractive financing options at the point-of-sale. We are well-positioned to address these evolving behaviors. Our agile approach has enabled us to support our partners as they strive to quickly meet these new demands. We have continued to invest in our digital assets and capabilities. Quickly recognizing in the early days of the pandemic that we needed to accelerate many of our efforts to support our partners as they continue their digital transformation. We have reallocated resources and agile teams to fast track key digital initiatives for our partners. Among the most critical digital innovations is one that is empowering fast and simple integration for our partners. Our next-generation native software development kit, or SDK, for partner integration. Rooted in user testing and research, the new patented SyPi technology offers a modern look and feel and allows our users to seamlessly apply, manage, pay and redeem rewards without ever leaving the partner's native app. Further enabling ease of integration for our partners is our expansive application programming interface, or API platform, for full credit life cycle capabilities. We offer a full suite of servicing APIs, with account and card management, accompanied by API's powering, the apply and buy experience digitally and at the point-of-sale. Giving customers choice at the point-of-sale is also critical, and we continue to invest and develop in order to meet customer demand. To complement our existing revolving credit offerings, we have rolled out an installment product called SetPay. We are currently in market with multiple payment solutions partners, and we'll be continuing to expand in 2021. To further enhance the contactless cardholder experience, we are also leveraging QR code technology. Using this technology, cards can be activated by scanning a QR code from the partner's app, or in the case of Venmo, a QR code printed on the plastic can be scanned to initiate sending a payment or to split purchases. In CareCredit, we have customized QR codes at providers' offices, which directs the patient to apply for a CareCredit account in the comfort of their own device. We also have the ability to deliver a safe and easy way for customers to pay in store and at the point-of-sale without needing the physical card, through barcodes delivered via SyPi within the retailer's app. The current technology has been enabled in the Lowe's app, and is driving sales app downloads. Further, we are bringing in-store experience to a customer\u2019s personal device for applications and payments. We have a patent-pending technology that provides an efficient contactless experience for customers using our own smartphones. The technology enables the transfer of data between the business and customers' mobile devices in store. For example, if a customer shops in-store and wants to open a line of credit, the business can send the application to the customer's mobile device through e-mail or QR code. The direct-to-device technology was brought to market with our Verizon card earlier this summer, and we are working with our partners to scale this innovation across industries. We are also integrating our financing offers throughout the entire digital shopping experience. In today's world, consumers enter websites on their own terms via a multitude of entry points, and every page is essentially now a landing page. Content, including access to credit and financing options, need to be optimized to drive conversion for our partners and connect the audience to the information needed to make an educated purchase and financing decision. We've had a long tradition of credit integration within the homepage of our larger clients, and have continued to invest in best practices for path to purchase site integration. We've increased presence across the shopping journey with prominent placement of the financing offer on product pages, the shopping cart and during the checkout process. These digital solutions allow the consumer to engage in financing, at the point in which they are making a purchase decision and significantly increases the sales conversion rate for our partners. We are complementing these leading digital integrations with path to purchase data analytics and research by industry. This data, inclusive of heat mapping the user experience, helps our clients identify where consumers are seeking information on financing and credit and has resulted in increasing conversion rates and applications. We will continue to invest in our digital capabilities, as they are paramount to driving digital sales penetration, an increasingly important component to the success of our program. In retail card, digital sales penetration was 47% in the third quarter, and digital applications were approximately 60% of our total application. The mobile channel alone grew 29% compared to the same quarter last year, excluding Walmart. Further, more than 65% of total payments made on our cardholders' accounts are done digitally. We are committed to providing partners and customers with enhanced innovative digital options from applying on their own devices, provisioning a new card into their digital wallet, transacting with contactless cards and making payments. Customers will continue to adapt to this new way of commerce, and we are committed to providing the digital and product innovations to support this evolution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Margaret said earlier, we are determined to keep our employees safe and help our partners, customers, and communities succeed during this difficult time. Despite continued uncertainty and volatility, we are grounded and guided by our values, and I'm so proud of how our people have continually shown resilience, dedication, and empathy to help those we serve. As always, I also want to thank those who are helping to keep us safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. Now, I'll turn to our financial results for the third quarter. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. First, I want to cover some of the trends we are seeing from the impact of COVID-19 from a purchase volume standpoint and thought it was important to provide an update on the performance of accounts that receive forbearance. Slide six shows year-over-year purchase volume growth for the total company and by platform dating back to January. As noted in our second quarter earnings call, purchase volume growth was strong for the total company and by platform with double-digit growth in January and February, leading into March. As we move through March and government restrictions increased, travel, entertainment, and many discretionary activities were significantly curtailed and a high number of non-essential businesses were closed. There was also a significant curtailment of elective healthcare services. As a result, purchase volume decreased significantly, with April declined 27% for the total company. And looking at April by sales platform, Retail Card declined 21%, Payment Solutions declined 41%, and CareCredit declined 60%. CareCredit was impacted the most with a significant decrease in spending for elective and planned procedures in dental and medical services during this period. Retail Card performed better due to the higher concentration of digital volume as well as having programs that benefited from an increase in spending for essential products, such as grocery, supplies, and home-related expenditures. As consumers became more comfortable under stay-at-home orders, and reopening of businesses continued over the summer and into the fall, we saw a recovery in purchase volume as we move through the second and third quarters. In September, overall purchase volume increased 5% over the prior year and each of the three sales platforms saw a significant recovery in purchase volumes from the April trough, with Retail Card up 7%, CareCredit up 5%, and Payment Solutions down only 4% compared to a year ago. Looking at some of the other key business drivers for the quarter, new accounts declined 17%, a significant improvement over the second quarter where new accounts declined by 36%. The decline in new accounts, while improving, does reflect the impact of the crisis as well as underwriting refinements we implemented. Purchase volume by account increased by 8% during the quarter, again, a significant improvement from the 8% decline in the second quarter. There is also a 4% increase in the average balance per account due to the combination of portfolio mix from our digital and retail partners as well as lower volume and new accounts. While we're encouraged by these trends, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty ahead, including whether further stimulus measures will be enacted and when industry-wide forbearance actions fully abate. However, our business mix, which includes a strong digital component as well as segments that are positioned to benefit, such as home-related products and veterinary services, has helped to dampen some of the effects of the economic downturn. The ultimate impact is still largely uncertain given the duration of magnitude of pandemic is still largely unknown at this point. Moving to slide seven, we highlight the impact and performance of accounts that were granted forbearance compared to accounts not in forbearance. Through September 30th, we granted minimum payment forbearance to a cumulative total of approximately 2 million accounts or a $3.8 billion in account balances at the time of forbearance. We have seen approximately 94% of these accounts need forbearance through September 30, being approximately 119,000 accounts or $227 million account balances remaining in forbearance. Through mid-October, these numbers have been relatively stable. Of the accounts in enrollment forbearance, approximately 92% of the balances are either current or less than 30 days past due. When you look at some of the performance characteristics, you will see trends that are not surprising. Credit line utilization is higher, payment rates are lower, and from a credit perspective, 59% of enrollees had a FICO score of 660 or below. From a trend perspective, we continue to see a substantial decline in the number of accounts enrolling in forbearance from a peak in late March to early April, where we saw nearly 40,000 accounts enrolling per day to approximately 3,500 accounts per day in September. Looking at payment behavior for September, 66% of the accounts that enrolled in forbearance were making payments. 8% of the accounts pay their balance in full, another 58% were making payments, leading 34% of the enrolled accounts not making payments. In looking at performance post program, we see a higher incident rate of accounts going delinquent and accounts that did not enter the forbearance program. For accounts which were current and timely entered the forbearance program, we see those accounts entering delinquency post-program at a rate of 3.3 times non-forbearance accounts. For accounts which were delinquent when they entered the forbearance program, we see those accounts entering delinquency post-program at a rate of 6.5 times non-forbearance accounts. It should be noted that the current status of these accounts is reflected in our delinquency statistics, and has not had a material impact on our 30 plus delinquency measures, which continued to improve during the third quarter. I\u2019ll cover delinquency performance later in the presentation. Our intention is to cease enrolling accounts into or extending the existing accounts in the forbearance program at the end of October, and saying ready to provide other forms of assistance to impact the cardholders. We will continue to closely monitor the performance of accounts who receive benefits from the forbearance program. Moving to the financial results on Slide 8. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $313 million or $0.52 per diluted share. This included a restructuring charge related to our previously announced strategic plan to evaluate our cost structure as a result of our shift in business mix and impact on the pandemic. The result was a series of actions, which included an exit or reduction in a number of our leased properties and certain employee-related actions, both on a voluntary and involuntary basis. The charge was recorded in the third quarter totaled $89 million or $67 million after-tax and reduced EPS by $0.11. The increase in the provision for credit losses, as a result of the implementation of CECL, was $66 million or $50 million after tax, which reduced EPS by $0.09 in the third quarter. COVID-19 continued to impact our growth in several areas, as noted on Slide 9. On a core basis, which excludes the Walmart and Yamaha portfolios, loan receivables were down 5%, and interest and fees on loan receivables were down 12%. On a core basis, purchase volume was flat, and average active accounts were down 8% compared to last year. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 36% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and declined 5% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, it accounted for 23% of the portfolio and declined 7% from the prior year. As I noted earlier, the impact of COVID-19 moderated as we move to the second and third quarter, specifically two of our three sales platforms saw a year-over-year increase in September. While we're seeing positive trending, the duration of magnitude of pandemic is still largely unknown, and it remains difficult to assess the stability and trends or provide a more precised forecast of the impact at this point. RSAs decreased $117 million or 12% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.6% for the quarter, reflecting the seasonality we RSAs decreased typically see in the third quarter as well as improved performance in certain elements of the sharing arrangements from some programs, mainly significant improvement in net charge-offs compared to last year. On a year-over-year basis, the RSA percent was also impacted by the discontinuance of the Walmart program last year, which operated an RSA percentage below the company average. The provision for credit losses increased $191 million or 19% from last year. The increase is primarily driven by the reserve increase for the projected impact of the COVID-19 related losses and the prior year reserve reduction related to Walmart that totaled $326 million, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The reserve build for the third quarter was $344 million, and largely due to the production impact of COVID-19-related losses, which I'll cover in greater detail later in the presentation. Other income increased $46 million, mainly due to lower loyalty costs resulting from the discontinuance of the Walmart program and a decline in purchase volume. Other expense was flat to last year, with restructuring charge and expenses related to our COVID-19 response being offset primarily by the cost reductions from the Walmart sale. Also reducing other expenses was the impact from lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced during the quarter and reduction in certain discretionary spend. Moving to our platform results on Slide 10. As I noted earlier, the sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to COVID 19. In Retail Card, core loan receivables were down 6%, with the COVID-19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in our digital programs. Other metrics were down, driven by the sale of the Walmart portfolio and the impact from COVID-19. As Margaret noted earlier, we're excited to launch the Venmo program after launching the Verizon program last quarter, as well as renewing and extending the key relationship with Sam's Club this quarter. The strength of powersports and Payment Solutions helped to offset the impact of COVID-19. Core loan receivables declined 1%. Interest and fees on loans on loans decreased 10%, driven primarily by lower late fees. Purchase volume decreased 6%, and average active accounts decreased 7%. We signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter, as noted on Slide 3. We continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks, and added over 4,000 new merchants during the quarter. These networks, along with other initiatives, such as driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 30% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas, continue to build a solid base of business for the future. Although CareCredit was impacted the most by COVID-19 earlier this year, we continue to see some encouraging signs in the trends during the third quarter, as providers continue to increase the degree of elective and planned services. Receivables declined 7%, primarily due to the negative impact of COVID-19. Interest and fees and loans decreased 8%, primarily driven by lower merchant discount as a result in decline in purchase volume, which was down 3%. Average active accounts decreased 8%. As Margaret noted earlier, we're excited to launch 3 new health systems during the quarter, which brings the total number of health systems we currently operate into nine. We continue to expand our CareCredit network and the utility of our card, as we added nearly 2,000 new provider locations to our network during the quarter. The network expansion has helped to drive a reuse rate to 59% for purchase volume in the third quarter. I'll move to slide 11, and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 21% from last year, primarily driven by a 22% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables, due to the impact of COVID-19 and the sale of the Walmart portfolio. On a core basis, interest and fees on loans decreased 12%. The net interest margin was 13.80% compared to last year's margin of 16.29%, largely driven by the impact of COVID-19 on loan receivables, an increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the mix of loan receivables, as a percent of total earning assets, declined approximately 640 basis points from 84.7% to 78.3%, driven by higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 124 basis points of net interest margin decline, a 193 basis point decline in loan receivable yield, primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of Walmart portfolio. The impact from lower primary movements accounted for approximately 75 basis points of the decline. The remaining reduction of approximately 120 basis points in loan receivable yield is primarily attributable to higher payment rates, resulting in lower revolve rate and lower late fee incidents. The total reduction in loan receivable yield accounted for 164 basis points of the reduction in our net interest margin. The investment securities yield declined as a result as a result of lower benchmark rate and accounted for 29 basis points on net interest margin decline. These impacts were partially offset by an 81 basis point decrease in total interest bearing liabilities cost to 1.90%, primarily due to the lower benchmark rates and lower deposit pricing. This provided a 68 basis point benefit to our net interest margin. Excluding the main impacts of COVID-19 has had on our net interest margin, the decrease in loan receivables and the increase in liquidity, the net interest margin will be trending closer to 15%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 12. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.67%, compared to 4.47% last year. The 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.24% compared to 2.07% last year. Higher payment trends are helping drive the improvement in delinquency rates. Focusing on the charge-off trends, the net charge-off rate was 4.42% compared to 5.35% last year. The reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the Walmart sale and improving credit trends. Excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio, net charge-off rate was approximately 45 basis points lower than last year. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.92% post-CECL implementation. Excluding the effects of CECL, the allowance under the ALLL method would have been 8.25%. The reserve build in the third quarter was $344 million under CECL, and $278 million under the ALLL method. The overall reserve provisioning was higher-than-expected due to the impact in 2019, which accounted for most of the reserve build in the third quarter. More specifically, our reserve build was driven by two main factors. First, an increase in the provision for accounts that received forbearance benefits; second, a projected diminished effect from stimulus. In summary, the third quarter credit trends continue to be strong and better than our expectations, with forbearance providing a degree of benefit in delinquency trends. We do expect overall credit trends will be impacted by COVID-19 as we move forward. Moving to slide 13. I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were flat to last year, totaling $1.1 million for the quarter. Restructuring charge and expenses related to our COVID-19 response were offset primarily by the cost reductions from the Walmart sale, the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced in the quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend. Efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 39.7% versus 30.8% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by the restructuring charge and expenses related to our response to COVID-19. Excluding those impacts, efficiency ratio would have been 370 basis points lower, or approximately 36% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charge and the COVID-19-related expenses, the increase in ratio was mainly driven by the decrease in revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield. Moving to slide 14. Given the reduction of our loan receivables and strengthen in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity during the third quarter. While we think it is prudent to have higher liquidity levels, given the level of uncertainty and volatility, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity. As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined by nearly $2.5 billion from last year. We also reduced the size of our securitized and unsecured funding sources by $3.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. This resulted in deposits being 80% of our funding, compared to 76% last year, with securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $27 billion, which equated to 28% of our total assets. This is up from 20.5% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint Federal banking agencies in March, which has two primary benefits. First, it delays the effect of the transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, allows for a portion of the current period provisioning under CECL to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 15.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 130 basis points above last year's level of 14.5%. The Tier 1 ratio was 16.7% under the CECL transition rules, compared to 14.5% last year, reflecting the preferred stock issuance last November. The total capital ratio increased 230 basis points as well to 18.1%, also reflecting the preferred issuance. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 27.3% compared to 20.7% last year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing CECL and the preferred stock issuance. During the quarter, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. Earlier this year, we announced that given the current economic uncertainty and being as prudent as possible, we made the decision to halt further share repurchases until we have greater visibility on the magnitude and the impact COVID-19 will ultimately have in the economic environment. We will continue to evaluate this as we move forward. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet, with diversified funding sources and operate with strong capital and liquidity levels. In closing, given the number of uncertainties that continue to exist regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the countering impacts that stimulus has had and could have going forward, it remains difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this time and provide specifics around key outlook drivers. As I did last quarter, I want to provide a framework to help consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers. Regarding loan receivables growth, COVID-19 has had an impact on purchase volume, but we've seen positive trending in improvement in purchase volume. As long as the pandemic does not worsen and businesses remain open, we expect this trend to continue or to be stable. What continues to help our trends and resiliency is growth in digital, diversity inside our platforms, and financing in essential areas, such as home and healthcare. We will continue leveraging our capabilities and expertise to help our partners and providers during this difficult period. This overall direction in purchase volume will be a key influence in our receivables growth rate. We've also seen higher payment trends, which has also impacted our loan receivables growth. This also favorably impacts credit trends as evidenced in our lower delinquency rates and net charge-offs. The offset to this is lower revolve and fees are non-accounts, negatively impacting loan receivable yields and the net interest margin. When the effects of stimulus and industry-wide forbearance program subside and delinquencies begin to increase, we expect payment rates to decline and have provided a positive impact to loan receivable growth. Our net interest margin has also been impacted by a number of other factors, including a higher level of liquidity and a reduction in the size and yield from the receivables due to lower benchmark rates, lower revolving fees, and the impact of forbearance. As we move forward, we will continue to look at ways to deploy a higher level of liquidity and the impact of forbearance should be. Should the current trends continue, we do believe the net interest margin has stabilized and should improve prospectively. As I indicated earlier, we do expect payment rate to decline and believe the revolve rate will increase as well as fees, which will also be a benefit to the net interest margin. Regarding RSAs, we expect an impact from higher credit costs in the future. While some programs are benefiting from lower net charge-off levels currently, we expect net charge-off levels to increase and impact the flow through of the RSAs. The ultimate amount of credit cost impact and timing will be determined somewhat by the expected deterioration in credit, as stimulus actions and industry-wide forbearance assistance abates. While we expect net charge-off rate to increase in the near-term, it should be noted that overall portfolio quality and credit trends, as we entered into this pandemic, were strong and continue to improve throughout the year into the third quarter. Also the tools and capabilities we have highlighted previously to help us better navigate the economic impacts from COVID-19. As we move forward, reserve bills may be somewhat elevated in comparison to the outlook we provided in January when taking into account seasonality. Until we gain more visibility into the duration of severity of the current pandemic, we cannot provide more specific guidance. Regarding the efficiency ratio, activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels and we will mitigate some of this impact through the recently announced strategic plan to reduce our operating expenses. We expect the cost savings from this plan to be in the $150 million to $250 million range for 2021. As a plan is executed, we expect the cost save run rate to increase throughout 2021. Beyond 2021, we expect to see even higher cost saves from this plan. In closing, the business remains fundamentally strong and resilient and we're going through the situation with a strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity position. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Clearly, the coronavirus pandemic has meaningfully impacted our business in several ways, including key areas such as purchase volume and loan receivables. As we have said, the ultimate impact from this crisis remains difficult to quantify right now. So what I can tell you is that our ability to rapidly adapt to the evolving environment positions us well. We are confident in the fundamental resilience of our company and our ability to manage through this cycle, just as we have managed through other cycles for nearly 90 years. Our partner-centric business model and agile approach to our operations and investments are enabling the rapid deployment of innovative solutions to support our partners and cardholders. We remain focused on execution today, with an eye towards the future, making investments, building capabilities, launching programs and making the fundamental changes necessary to emerge from this pandemic in a stronger position. Thank you for participating on the call today, and I hope you and your families stay healthy and safe. I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. Greg Ketron : That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and- answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Jefferies, we have John Hecht. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. Just related to the provision expense. It seems \u2013 well, I guess, the question is, is this more of a general increase in the allowance tied to just general uncertainty, or is it more of a precised provision tied to certain elements you're seeing in the deferral program? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Good morning, John. So the provision \u2013 the way to think about the provision for the quarter is when you look at the macroeconomic environment. When you look at growth, when you look at our kind of precision, that all netted out to roughly flat to a small provision. When we look at two specific elements, as we closed the quarter, one being the forbearance accounts that have come off program, given the delinquency rate they had when we evaluate those accounts, we thought there needed to be a higher provision associated with those particular accounts beyond what was included in the base reserve. So there was an incremental, call it, $200 million to $225 million associated with those accounts that are in delinquency today that we're in the forbearance program or current today that may roll into forbearance. And the residual piece really went to our view on the stimulus. And the fact that our view, the timing of the stimulus as well as the efficacy of the stimulus would be delayed. So there's an incremental provision of roughly $75 million associated with the stimulus delay. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks for the detail. And then the SetPay product, that's consistent with a lot of the consumer demand we're seeing now in the marketplace. Maybe if you could just give us a sense of the growth potential, growth trajectory of that product? And then will the \u2013 call it, the economics, meaning the yield and the anticipated losses and so forth, be consistent with the overall credit program? Margaret Keane : Thanks, John. Thanks for the question. I'd say two things. One, we wanted to address the market. We already had installment light products out there, which meet our return hurdles. So we are being very thoughtful and cognizant and looking at how these products work. But I would tell you that what we're looking to do really with SetPay is to offer the customer choice between our different product set. And hopefully, do this in a way that's online. So as the customer is making the purchase, particularly a big purchase, they have the opportunity to do the SetPay product. And we're looking to do that in light of our overall portfolio with returns and \u2013 that we have in the business today. So we're not looking to minimize or reduce our returns because of that product. Look, I think everyone's looking at these products as a big part of the market. There's lots of sales out there. These products are still a really small subset of the market. But I do think we felt competitively, it was important to really position ourselves to have that product with \u2013 for consumers. But I don't think, down the road, you're going to see this as a big part of who we are, but another product to really help our partners grow their business. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Thanks very much. The reason for that is I think a lot of our partners, while they want to offer this product, to Margaret's point, and have choice for the consumer, we've spent a lot of time working with our partners to get reused on the card, and Brian talked about earlier. And so we have some partners who say, look, I want to offer a revolving product to get that second and third purchase. And that's been something we've been working on for well over 5 years now. And they're not as enamored with the one-and-done product. But look, at the end of the day, we want to be able to offer choice at the point-of-sale. John Hecht : That makes sense. Thank you guys very much. Brian Wenzel : Thanks John. Have a good day. Operator : From Credit Suisse, we have Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe just a follow up on that reserving question, Brian. So as we think about it going forward, should we think that the reserve would be at a comparable percentage if there's no kind of macroeconomic changes? Are there other things kind of as we go into 2000 \u2013 the fourth quarter and into 2021, to consider in terms of that reserve build or third quarter decrease? Brian Wenzel : Good morning Moshe. So the way I would think about it is, we feel that we're adequately reserved at the end of September for both the forbearance count specifically, but the overall portfolio, assuming macroeconomic trends don't move significantly. And to be honest with you, to make sure that pandemic stays in check with where it is today, the real impact to reserves will be growing in the portfolio and any shifts in the portfolio we see between the platforms. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks. And I thought the \u2013 from the standpoint of kind of new account generation, you said the number of new accounts was down from a little over 6 million to just a little over 5 million. Maybe as you kind of think about the various factors there, obviously, where we are in the county, the 2 launches that you've got in all of the initiatives, can you talk a little bit about that metric? What that's going to look like in the fourth quarter and into 2021? And I might mean for the growth that you want to see? Margaret Keane : Thanks, Moshe. It's Margaret. I'd say two things. One, we're -- I would say, in September, we did start seeing store traffic start really coming back at a bigger pace. We still originate a lot of accounts in-store. So having that in-store traffic come back, I think, is going to be very helpful. I think as we continue to market our new programs, where we'll see positive trend there. I think the real question mark is really how does holiday play out? Right now our view is consumers are saying they want to shop, and they want to do something fun and be out there. So I think holiday is going to play into this as well. And then the only maybe negative or downside to that would be, we did -- we do tighten credit during this period. So we are being careful there. We don't want to just open up the faucet, if you will, to new accounts. So we're really being soft on capital on how we're underwriting. But I think the trends we started seeing in September with more store traffic, should help our new account volume as we go into the fourth quarter. Moshe Orenbuch : And just anything about the new programs impact either in the third quarter or March? Margaret Keane : Well, yeah, I mean, I would say Verizon is tracking very well. They were slower to open stores. So we're just starting to see store traffic from them. They were more online, but we're really seeing that pick up, and we're really pleased with how Verizon is playing out. Venmo, on the other hand, still in a softer launch. So we're really still testing and piloting that product. But again, the results so far have been extremely positive. If you haven't applied for the card or, I guess, you can apply, you got to get off it. But for those who've gotten off the card, we've gotten really, really positive feedback in terms of the value prop, how the card works, how easy it is to activate, how easy it is to purchase with it. So we anticipate the Venmo product to be a big part of our growth story as we go into 2021. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. The way I'd frame it, for the quarter, Moshe, the fourth quarter, both Verizon and Venmo won't have a large impact, it's really be more into progress into 2021. And Margaret's point really about stores opening up the biggest wildcard with regard to new accounts in the fourth quarter will ultimately be the channels, right? We see some differences in new accounts per your digital channels versus your in-store. So that could be a very favorable trend for us, we hope in the fourth quarter. Moshe Orenbuch : Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Moshe. Have a good day. Operator : From Bank of America, we have Mihir Bhatia. Please go ahead. Mihir Bhatia : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and good morning. I just wanted to start. Maybe could you just give us your CECL assumptions just on GDP, unemployment assumptions this year, and maybe exiting next year? Brian Wenzel : Sure. Good morning. So the baseline measure that we used, which is really coming off of the Moody's August baseline metric, which has unemployment at that point being 9.9% at the end of this year, 7.9% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022. And as we've gone through and done our modeling off of that, the way which we interpret it, we actually have redistributed that unemployment curve. So effectively, the unemployment we have at the end of the year is 9.7%, down from the second quarter, 9.1% in 2021, up slightly from our previous estimate and 6.3% in 2022. So we have a little bit slower recovery back into 2021, as we think things have pushed out, which partially, as we talked about, some of the stimulus and other metrics. And then, the GDP assumptions we have in line with the Moody's, the baseline model, to be honest with you, which had a linked quarter 5.4% decline in the third and 0.7% in the fourth. Mihir Bhatia : Great. Thank you. And then, I just had -- I wanted to just talk maybe -- just go back to the discussion on, I think, buy now, pay later, the installment product. And I wanted to see -- ask about the impact on the retail card business, I understand that it's a small part of the market right now, overall. But we're starting to see it at more and more retailers. And just as an example, PayPal, one of your partners launched Pay in 4, and it shows up right alongside PayPal credit on the checkout screen. So it seems like there's at least some cannibalization risk. Now, I understand Pay in 4 is new, but some of the other BNPL products have been around for a while. So I was curious, how you -- how are you viewing those products? And have you seen any impact from those products on the Retail Card platform that you already have? Thank you. Margaret Keane : I'd say, no, we've not really seen a big impact on our portfolio or with our partners. I think that is why we have set pay out there. And I do think having customer choice is going to be the thing that we want to really do. We want to do that mobilely as well, so that customers, when they're in the shopping cart, can make a choice. In terms of PayPal, we know that we have a great partnership with PayPal. They had a product that they had already launched in the U.K. and wanted to accelerate their launch here in the U.S. We see that as a cross-sell opportunity for us, like Brian said earlier. So, again, we feel like we're positioning ourselves in the marketplace to be successful. We're not, at this point, really seeing a huge impact of these products against our overall performance. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks. Have a good day. Operator : From JPMorgan, we have Rick Shane. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Hey, thanks for taking my questions this morning. I'm curious to how the change in the way that consumers are interacting with businesses, fits with your business model? And when I think about that, historically, you guys probably had a higher percentage of in-store card-present transactions. As you move to your mobile app, you went to a highly secured tokenized transaction. And now you probably have many more customers shopping online, card not present. The business model has historically had lower interchange. And so, I'm wondering, from an economic perspective, is there greater fraud risk? And is there a way within the business model to offset that economically? Margaret Keane : Yes. Well, I think, it's important to note, most of our transactions are private label transactions, which don't target anything. So for us, that's not an issue. I think what's really important for us is ensuring from a fraud perspective that we have the right customer applying. We\u2019ve put a number of tools in place to really drive fraud and make sure we're offering the customer the right product to that right customer. I would say, generally speaking, fraud is something that we continually battle; every financial institution is up against this battle, particularly as more and more people have been compromised in terms of their identities. And really, it's our responsibility to really put the tools in place to make sure that we're doing the best job possible to reduce that fraud. I don't know, Brian, if you'd add -- Brian Doubles, if you'd add anything on transaction volumes? Brian Doubles : Yes, the only thing I would add, Rick, we've talked about this in previous calls. This is where we're really leveraging data share with our partners. Our partners know quite a bit about their customers. They know how long they've been a customer, either through a mobile or digital channel. Even simple things like if we can match the ship to address, with the address that they're putting into the apply tool to apply for a credit line. Those things are enormously helpful in helping us authenticate the customer and reducing fraud rate itself. That's something that we rolled out across all of our large partners in Retail Card and we're rolling it out now to even some of the smaller partners to share that data in an effort to reduce fraud, but also make better credit decisions around line sizes, and get a better credit outcome as well. Rick Shane : Got it. And Margaret, that's exactly my point, which is with no interchange on the traditional transaction, what I was sort of trying to understand, and it sounds like you're managing it more on the fraud side. Trying to determine if there's some way, on the card-not-present transactions over the online, whether or not you can capture some additional economics? Margaret Keane : I got that. Sorry about that. But yes, we -- exactly what Brian was describing. Rick Shane : Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Rick. Have a good day. Operator : From Morgan Stanley, we have Betsy Graseck. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Brian Wenzel : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : So, I'd like to call it the finger traffic versus the foot traffic. And I know in the prior question, you answered it from a foot traffic point of view. But I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the finger traffic in terms of generating that new account? And then how have you seen that finger traffic change over the course of the pandemic? Have you seen any behavior change in terms of frequency of purchase, average size of purchase? Just line utilization that people are willing to maintain, especially in the latter, more recent couple of months, I should say? Just wondering if the behavior is changing at all? Margaret Keane : Well, Brian touched on this a little bit and I'll have Brian Doubles add a little color to this. But 60% of our applications for Retail Card were generated mobilely or online. So, that is a big shift from where we were. And each quarter, it's been growing. Our view is that, that will continue to grow. In addition to which consumers are using our apps to make payments, increased credit lines and really transact through their mobile phone. We expect that to continue to grow and be a big part of what we're working on with our partners. I would say that what we're always trying to do is create this digital point-of-sale, both in the Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit business. So, it's not just the Retail Card side, it's actually all three platforms. And back in March, we really pivoted our agile teams to really accelerate some of the development on the mobile side. So, I would say -- I don't think we're seeing difference in terms of spend or how they spend. I think the reality is that people don't necessarily always want to go into the store. So, online has become a bigger part of how they transact. And I'd say the second is, just as we move forward, the whole contactless even in-store purchasing, I think, will become a bigger part because consumers really don't want to touch point of sales. So those are the areas that we continue to invest in. I don't know, Brian Doubles if you'd add? Brian Doubles : Yes. One of the things I would add, Betsy, is one of the things we've been very focused on and actually, one of the areas that we accelerated back in March is really integrating our financing offers throughout that customer shopping journey, and we showed you a little bit of that on the slide. And that looks very different by partner. So if you think about SyPI or SDK that plugs into the larger partners' apps, that we've been doing for a number of years now. And that works really well with large partners, so either the SyPI product or having the larger partners plug right into our API platform, which is what we're doing on Venmo. The work that we accelerated back in March and April, which really matters more to our smaller to mid-sized partners, is really getting integrated into their digital properties across the point-of-sale. So not just when you're checking out in the shopping cart, but when you're looking at the product, when you enter the home page, and we've seen conversion rates go up significantly when we have that kind of multi-point integration across all of their digital properties. And so that's really what we've been focused on, is helping not just our large partners, but small to midsize partners, getting the financing offer presented multiple places throughout that shopping journey. And again, that's been really important to our partners because, obviously, times like these, they're accelerating our digital transformation and trying to drive sales, and this, certainly, helps them do that. Betsy Graseck : And how penetrated do you feel you are with your current customer set in that offering? Brian Doubles : Well, it really varies. I'd say we're very penetrated in the larger partners, and we're making really good progress in the small to mid-sized partners. But a lot of this is \u2013 it's really a joint partnership. It depends on their level of how far advanced they are in their digital transformation. And we're building tools to easily plug in there in a scalable way. Betsy Graseck : And then my follow up just is on liquidity. You highlighted in the deck that the liquidity is up significantly year-on-year. It makes sense. Wondering how much of that will you sit on to fund future loan growth, or will you be redeploying that into securities? There's clearly excess capital that could drive buybacks as well going forward. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about this excess liquidity that you've got? Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Betsy. As we think about, as we enter the fourth quarter, it's really to fund the portfolio growth that we would seasonally anticipate. As we move into 2021, we hope it funds loan growth. We said earlier, with regard to buybacks, obviously, we like to have the cash to, and we most certainly have the capital to execute the buybacks, but really that's not on our horizon until probably at least the back half of the year when we have a better view of what the economy is going to do. So our plan really is to deploy it relative to growth in the assets and managing the liability side of the equation. I don't anticipate us really going to try to chase some basis points to yield in the investment portfolio, to be honest with you. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Betsy. Have a good day. Operator : From Wolfe Research, we have Bill Carcache. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Margaret, there was a period post Walmart where you guys eliminated concerns over renewal risk by pushing the earliest renewal date to 2022, which seemed really far away at the time. But now with 2022 getting closer and RFP is happening, in some cases, roughly a year ahead of contractual maturity dates. Some investors have started to ask whether we could see you guys do something similar to what you did post Walmart by possibly renewing your largest partnerships, and sort of eliminating that renewal risk for several years into the future. Can you discuss whether that's something that you're considering, or are we more likely to see renewals happen on more of a case-by-case basis? Margaret Keane : Look, we're always trying to renew deals. So I think this is really the relationship and partnership that we've built over the years. And I think you just saw it happen with Sam's Club. We renewed Sam's Club with a multiyear deal last year. And we just renewed it again with another multiyear deal. So we're always looking at ways to extend our partnerships. And usually, that conversation comes about as people are thinking about new value props or big investments into the program in some way. And I would just tell you the way I think about renewals that's like a daily part of our jobs. And we need to make sure that we're having those conversations where it makes sense. So you see it happening real time with what happened with Sam's Club. Brian Wenzel : I think the one thing I'd add on to Margaret's point is that, when you look at these investments, so in the case of Sam's, that there's a value prop construct that's on top to renewal we did last year, and we priced at a very disciplined level, right? We priced through the cycle and priced through a very difficult cycle here. So to the extent that we get an opportunity to extend at attractive risk return profile, we most, certainly, would take that opportunity and take that risk off the table, Bill. Bill Carcache : Thank you. That's very helpful. If I can, as a follow-up, when we look at the levels of capital that you guys are running at, and the amount of building that you've done, to the extent that there potentially could be some sort of stimulus that it seems like you're not really counting on that as a big benefit in the reserve building that you've done to-date. Historically, you guys have expressed your belief that you could run at capital levels comparable to your peers, which we see at sort of the 10.5%, 11% range on a normalized basis. Is it reasonable to think that you guys can get CET1 down to that range, as we look ahead to kind of the other side of this? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Yes, Bill. So first of all, let me just make sure we're clear on stimulus. We still have stimulus baked into our reserves. It's just at a lower level, and the timing is different than what you would see in -- based on Moody's model, I think, last week, they may have even moved out to 2021 their stimulus, but we have spent a lot of time with it. So there is some level of stimulus. With regard to the capital level, yes, nothing has changed in our view with regard to how we think about the long-term capital position and being able to get down to our peers. During this period of time, we continue to run stress cases, and are very comfortable with our ability, given the resiliency of the business, given the earnings profile of the business, the RSAs that we can get down to that level. So there's no change with regard to the long-term view on capital. The time in which we begin to deploy greater amounts of capital back to the shareholders will really be dependent upon the economy and the visibility. Bill Carcache : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Margaret Keane : Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : From Stephens, we have Vincent Caintic. Please go ahead. Vincent Caintic : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. First, on your expenses. So it's helpful to get your guidance for $150 million to $250 million for 2021 and more beyond that? And also just thinking about your push on digital here, I'm sort of wondering if you can sort of talk about your digital investments? And it seems like you're pushing more than usual to accelerate your partners' digital transformation. Is this the level we should expect in terms of investments going forward? Do you want to make more investments, or does this taper off after a little bit of time? Thank you. Margaret Keane : Well, we've been making investments for a number of years, particularly in our technology platform, and we'll continue to do that as we see the need. We think that, strategically, we have to be the best of the business in terms of digital capability. And both -- I think, both in the front end, which we've talked a lot about, but even on the back end. And so when we looked at, kind of pivoting back in March, we actually stopped doing some things that didn't really make sense given the pandemic and redeployed those resources to accelerate some of the things that were already on our roadmap. So it wasn't like we created new thinking, we actually had these plans. They would just furthered out. An example I'll give you is we're doing a lot of work on digital collections right now, in terms of really getting us to be state-of-the-art there. So that's an example where we took resources that we're kind of working on that, but we put more resources on it. I'd say that from an expense point of view, we took a really comprehensive look at our overall expenses and said, okay, how do we tighten? Where do we tighten? Some of that we talked about in terms of our footprint, which was a positive one. But when we did this journey on expenses, we basically said, we're going to do this expense reduction in order to ensure we can still invest for the future because, I think sometimes the mistake you make is you tighten so much that you really dilute the future. And what we didn't want to do is really have that happen. So we've been hard at work making sure we continue to invest, while tightening where we can. So that's really the plan that we've kind of executed upon we have work to do going into 2021. But we feel like we were able to hit it pretty quickly and really align our cost base to the size of our business going forward, to ensure that we keep the returns that we want to achieve for our shareholders. So we're feeling -- we've executed well here. We still have things to do, of course, but we're well into the execution of the expenses coming out. Vincent Caintic : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just with the excess deposits that you were talking about. Just wondering how much more aggressive you're willing to get on raised cuts, or do you feel comfortable here? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we'll continue to evaluate that market. We led the market down this year. So we've reduced 115 basis points on our high yield savings, 140 basis points on CDs, with six and seven movements. Here's -- as we think macroeconomically going forward, there will be some pressure as we used to have some higher priced CDs coming up for exploration as we move through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. So there will be some pressure to redeploy those dollars for our consumers. We also think there's an opportunity as we think some of the larger institutions may continue to try to reduce rates, so there may be some inflows. But at the end of the day, we hope to grow the business next year, and we'll need those deposits. So it's a very it's a very tricky balance. We can move down a little bit more, we think, but we want to be very cautious because what we don't want to do is if we have to raise deposits next year have to then pay more in price in order to get those deposits. So it's really a fine balance between trying to find that appropriate floor. And we're in line with competition. There could be a little bit more room, but I wouldn't expect something significant. Greg Ketron : Brandon, we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes. From KBW, we have Sanjay Sakhrani. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just on the Sam's Club renewal, congratulations on that. I know it's been a whirlwind the last couple of years. I'm just curious, how should we think about the economic impacts of the renewal? Are there any appreciable impacts on the RSAs going forward? And any other that we need to contemplate? Margaret Keane : We always look at this in terms of the returns and we\u2019re pretty happy with where we landed on the renewal in terms of our raw returns. So I wouldn\u2019t see a big economic impact. I think the real positive here is that we\u2019ve been able to work closely with Sam's over the last, say, 15 to 18 months on really helping them execute against their digital strategy and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I think more importantly the exciting part is really relaunching a new value prop, which both of us felt was really needed. So we're excited to work with them on that as we go into 2021. But I don't think you'll see an appreciable difference in the economics. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, I have a follow up on the Buy Now, Pay Later industry questions, and maybe it's a question for you, Margaret and Brian Doubles. If we think about the industry's impact thus far, do you feel like it's had an appreciable impact in terms of loan growth? Do you feel like it's cannibalizing your customers across all your relationships, or is it just a different customer base that's sort of -- where you're seeing the uptake in this product? Margaret Keane : Well, I think -- first, let's put it in perspective. I think the overall dollar sales on those products, somewhere between $8 billion and $10 billion, which is really not that appreciable, when you look at the overall market. Most of what's being put out there are smaller ticket for payment type things for retailers. I think where we really have a market and/or have a solid customer base, it's really a bigger ticket size. And that's where I think we've been able to do things like we're doing with Amazon. So our view is, we're going to be in this market. We're going to look at the right way to do this. The other thing I'd tell you, it's still early days on the overall economic returns on these particular smaller ticket ones. But SetPay is a product that we're testing and piling. We're having good success. I think it's really about two things : giving customer choice; and then second, helping the merchants complete the sell. Because right now, the most important thing for our merchants and our partners is to help them grow theirselves, which is what we're really trying to work on. I don't know, Brian Doubles, if you'd add anything there? Brian Doubles : No, I think it does. It comes down to choice. And our partners all have a view on which products they want to offer. In some cases, it's a revolving credit product that has an installment component could be SetPay. In some cases, if it's smaller ticket, to Margaret's point, they would be more interested in the Buy Now Pay Later product. Our goal at the end of the day is to be very integrated across all of our partners' digital properties and offer a wide range of financing products, because it won't be a one-size-fits-all. It's going to be a combination of revolving credit, longer-term installment and shorter-term buy now pay later products. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Great. Thanks Sanjay. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have, and we hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit, nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Margaret Keane, Brian Doubles and Brian Wenzel. I will now turn the call over to Margaret. Margaret Keane : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a challenging year marked by a global pandemic, economic disruption and unrest due to racial injustice. It was a true test to our resilience, our agility and our strength as a business. We're proud of the way Synchrony managed through these challenges. Though there have been significant developments that provide hope that the pandemic will begin to moderate, the virus resurgence and resulting regional shutdown and continued impact on unemployment is something we are still managing through. And though the pandemic continues to impact results, we are encouraged by some of the trends that have developed. Later in the call Brian Wenzel will detail these impacts on the quarter\u2019s results and provide a view on how we think this year might develop. I will provide a high level overview here.  Let's first focus on our quarterly results, including some of our recent successes, which are outlined on slides 3 and 4. Earnings were $738 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 over the last year. Loan receivables were down 6% to $81.9 billion and average active accounts decreased 10% from last year, with new accounts down 19%. Purchase volume per account increased 10% over the last year to $602, and average active balance per account increased 4% to just under $1,200. Net interest margin was down 37 basis points to 14.64%. And the efficiency ratio was 37.1% for the quarter. Net charge-offs hit a new low at 3.16%. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy, in response to COVID-19 impacts on our balance sheet, deposits were down $2.3 billion or 4% versus last year. This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth given the excess liquidity we have. Total deposits comprise 80% of our funding, and our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source.  Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attractive to depositors and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. During the quarter we returned $128 million in the quarter through common stock dividends. We also announced that the Board authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021 beginning in the first quarter. We have a solid pipeline across our platforms, a mix of start-up and existing programs. But we are being very disciplined around risk and return given the uncertainty in the current environment. And while this return landscape is shifting, we believe similar opportunities will continue as evidenced by recent wins. I will touch upon a few highlights.  We announced that we will become the issuer of Walgreens cobranded credit card program in the U.S., the first such credit program in the retail health sector. The card will allow customers to earn rewards for purchases anywhere MasterCard is accepted. We expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021. This new agreement builds upon the company's existing strategic partnership. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 9,000 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores. We are committed to providing Walgreen customers and patients with unparalleled experiences, a best-in-class loyalty program and the ability to manage their health and wellness spending.  In addition, we renewed our strategic partnership with Mattress Firm. We provide flexible financing solutions, and innovative business tools that empower Mattress Firm to meet their customers at critical moments in the purchasing journey, which is increasingly online. Our digital tools and industry leading credit programs team, including marketing and analytic retail experts have optimized every step of the omni-channel customer journey to deliver a competitive user experience. We look forward to many more years as a strategic partner of Mattress Firm. We also reached a definitive agreement to acquire a Allegro Credit, a leading provider point-of-sale consumer financing for audiology products and dental services. Allegro offers numerous customers loan options through its merchant partners with flexible payment terms at the point-of-sale. These products are designed to offer customers choice to purchase the products and services they need or want. The addition of Allegro Credit\u2019s merchant network and customers complements our strategy of growing CareCredit, our leading health and wellness financing platform. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.  All together this quarter, we signed nine renewals and won seven new deals along with the acquisition. I cannot overstate the importance of digital innovation to the success of our programs. Consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our digital assets and continuously investing to ensure our partners are well positioned in this rapidly evolving dynamic. These investments include the capabilities to empower staff and seamless integration with our partners\u2019 digital assets, enable customer choice at the point-of-sale, enhance contactless experiences, facilitate a seamless and easy application process, bring the in-store experience to a customer's digital devices for applications and payments, and integrate our financing office throughout the entire digital shopping experience. We also continue to expand our digital penetration of all aspects of our customer journey, apply, buy and service. Approximately 50% of our applications were done digitally during the fourth quarter and grew 18% in mobile channel application. In Retail Card 51% of our sales occurred online. Finally, approximately 65% of our payments were made digitally. In short, we\u2019re rising to the challenges presented by this difficult time. We have strengthened the strategic positioning of our business and expanded the opportunity set that lies before us. And we're investing in the right strategy that will enable near term successes, while also driving considerable shareholder value over the long-term. With our future in mind, as you know, a few weeks ago, we announced some important changes to the leadership of this company. Effective April 1, I will transition to the role of Executive Chair of our Board of Directors and Brian Doubles will become Synchrony\u2019s President and CEO. Synchrony means so much to me. And one of my goals as CEO was to set up based off a leadership transition with a successor who will advance on what we have built. Both the Board and I believe there was no one in the world better equipped to do that than Brian. Brian has helped to build Synchrony every step of the way. He has been my trusted partner for more than a decade, including through our IPO. When we started Synchrony back in 2014, we set out to build a great business with a great culture that delivers for our partners and customers every day. Together with our 16,500 employees, we are doing just that. With Synchrony in a position of strength now is the time to implement this transition, allowing Brian to continue the incredible progress that has been made and to drive the next stage of Synchrony\u2019s exciting growth journey. I look forward to working with Brian through this transition and continuing to support Synchrony\u2019s growth and future success as a decade chair.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Doubles : I want to start by thanking Margaret for all that she has done for Synchrony and for me personally over the last decade. We truly would not be where we are or who we are today without her leadership and it's an absolute honor to succeed her and lead Synchrony into the future. I'm also grateful that we will continue to benefit from Margaret's expertise and leadership in her role as Executive Chair. And I'm excited to partner with her and the Board, our leadership team, and especially our employees as we continue to capitalize on our momentum. There's a lot to be excited about as we continue Synchrony\u2019s journeys. We have a strong business, a winning culture, and a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong foundation. As incoming CEO, I will continue to implement the strategies that we've developed over the last three years, which has enabled the momentum that our business has today. We will continue to leverage our competitive strength, deepen our market leadership, and invest in digital, data analytics and new product offerings to create a seamless customer experience. We will continue to grow our business and drive value for all of our stakeholders, our investors, our employees, our partners, and our customers.  On that note, I'd like to shift gears and turn to Slide 5 to talk about just one example of a strategy that we implemented to enhance the utility and value of our offerings, and which has become an important part of our business today, equal payment financing. Fundamental to our business is our objective to provide a full suite of products that can be tailored to serve the evolving needs of our customers and partners while earning appropriate economic returns. Our partners\u2019 most clinical needs are centered on their ability to offer a product that can seamlessly integrate with their digital assets and systems, deliver higher average order volumes and sales, increase conversion rates, and deepen customer loyalty. By the same token, customers have their own unique set of needs, including financing solutions that fit within their budget, are transparent and easy and convenient to use and which offer them flexibility in their purchase and financing decisions. We have extensive experience and installment lending, which has informed our approach to equal payment financing. We think about these products in two categories. First, evolving products. We offer mid and long-term equal payment plans, with promotional periods anywhere from 12 to 152 months depending on the product category. We also offer short-term equal payment plans with promotional periods of 3 to 12 months. Second, closed end products. We offer collateralized installment products for bigger ticket purchases with promotional periods from 12 to 180 months. And we also offer short and long-term installment loans through our SetPay product. These products run anywhere from three to 36 months. All these products are priced appropriately to meet our partner and customer objectives, with APR starting at zero percent and each of these products in turn offer distinct benefits and address the unique objectives of our partners and customers.  Revolving equal pay products for example, can be embedded inside of an existing revolving account, eliminating the need for a customer to open a new account. And given the nature of their functionality, we also provide repeat purchases, as well as higher engagement and loyalty to the partners\u2019 plan. Meanwhile, closed end products tend to appeal to customers that prefer regular predictable payments. To put our overall equal payment financing strategy in perspective, we currently have $15 billion in equal payment balances, 56% of which have 0% APR financing. We have about 74,000 partners or locations offering our payment plan products. And we have an overall repeat purchase rate of approximately 30% within 24 months of the first purchase. Synchrony's success in this and our other core strategies has been driven by our commitment to data-driven innovation, a deep understanding of our partners' objectives and customer needs and our ability to adapt as the competitive landscape and market conditions have evolved over time. Our organization is built around being nimble, responsive and results oriented. We leverage our decades of underwriting experience, our proprietary data analytics and our industry expertise in order to design and implement customized solutions that address our partners' needs while also delivering appropriate economic outcomes. This is what has driven Symphony's longstanding track record and deepened our market leadership over the years. We are excited to drive this momentum forward in 2021 simply by continuing to enhance the value we offer to all those we serve. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to congratulate Margaret and Brian on their new roles and thank them for what they have done for Synchrony and for me personally. I speak for everyone in the company when I say we look forward to working closely with them in the next chapter for Synchrony. As we begin 2021, we're encouraged by the developments being made to fight the pandemic, and continue to be inspired by those in the frontlines. For our part, we remain dedicated to keeping our employees safe, in helping our partners, customers and communities during this difficult period, guided by our values and principles and with the partner centric focus, we are working to help our constituents navigate this environment with an eye towards the future and the opportunities ahead of us as we begin to overcome the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, the pandemic continued to impact our growth on several areas, as noted on Slide 7. However, our business mix, which includes a significant digital component and certain industries benefiting from staying at home such as home related products and services, veterinary services, and electronics and appliances have outbalanced against some of the effects of the economic downturn. Purchase volume was essentially flat, down 1% versus last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter, despite some pressure from new shutdowns and restrictions as the pandemic progressed during the quarter. The continued pressure caused our average active accounts to be down 10% and a decrease in loan receivables of 6%. Payment rates continue to be elevated relative to normalized levels. Interest and fees on loans were down 11% from last year, consistent with the core decrease we experienced last quarter. Dual and co-branded cards account for 38% of our purchase line in the fourth quarter and declined 4% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, they account for 24% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year. While we're seeing positive trending in our growth metric as we enter the quarter, the acceleration of the pandemic resulted in regional shutdowns and diminished effects of the CARES Act stimulus slowed that early momentum. While our sales are stable, we are encouraged by recent developments, including the recently enacted stimulus, the proposed stimulus, a new administration and national rollout of a vaccine. We believe these factors will have a positive impact. It should provide momentum as we progress through 2021. I'll provide a more comprehensive view on 2021 shortly. RSAs increased $18 million or 2% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 5.2% for the quarter. This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs and the elimination of Walmart, which operated at a lower than company average RSA percentage. The improvement in net charge-offs resulted in a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $354 million or 32% from last year. This was partially offset by a reserve build in the fourth quarter of $119 million. Other income decreased $22 million, mainly due to higher loyalty costs. Other expense decreased $79 million or 7% from last year due to lower purchase volume and average active accounts, coupled with lower employee costs as we have begun to implement our strategic plan to reduce operating expenses. Moving to our platform results on Slide 8. Our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to COVID-19, and their trajectories through this period have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hardline goods. In Retail Card, loan receivables were down 8%, with the COVID-19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in digital programs. That resiliency is evident in the growth in purchase line, which was up 1% over last year. Other performance metrics were down due to the impact from COVID-19. We're excited about the launch of our new value prop with Sam's Club. They are an important and valued partner, and we're excited about the changes in this program for Sam's Club members. The continued strength of Power Sports and Home Specialty in Payment Solutions helped offset some of the impact from COVID-19. Loan receivables declined 2%. Average active account and interest and fees on loans were down 9%, which was driven primarily by lower yield on loan receivables. Purchase line decreased 7% this quarter. We signed several new programs and renewed several key partnerships this quarter. We continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added over 2,800 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 34% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas. Our efforts and successes are expanding an already solid base for growth as we exit the pandemic. Although CareCredit was impacted the most by COVID-19 earlier this year, we began to see some improvement as the year progressed as providers continue to increase elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter. That said, rising infection rates and increasing stay at home restriction did slow some of this progress.  Loan receivables declined 7%, with interest and fees on loans decreasing 4% primarily driven by lower merchant discount revenue as a result of decline in purchase volume, which was down 6%. Average active accounts decreased 10%. As Margaret noted earlier, we're excited about our partner activity within this platform including the acquisition of Allegro Credit, our Aspen Dental renewal and expansion and our new partnership with Community Veterinary Partners. During the quarter, we also continued to grow our CareCredit network and enhanced utility of our card. The expansion of our network and acceptance strategy has helped to drive reuse rate to 59% of purchase line in the fourth quarter. We are proud of these achievements, and particularly excited about the opportunities we see to drive future growth in this platform as the impact of the pandemic subsides. I'll move to Slide 9 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 9% from last year primarily driven by an 11% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the impact of COVID-19. Net interest margin was 14.64% compared to last year's margin of 15.01%, largely driven by the impact of COVID-19 on loan receivables, an increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined approximately 30 basis points from 80.2% to 79.9%, driven by higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 5 basis points of the net interest margin decline. The loan receivables yield of 19.93% was down 94 basis points versus last year and was a driver of a 75 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for a 30 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by an 89 basis point decrease in the total interest-bearing liabilities cost to 1.69%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates and a higher proportion of deposit funding. This provides a 73 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.07% compared to 4.44% last year. The 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.40% compared to 2.15% last year. Higher payment trends have helped drive the improvement in delinquency rates.  Focusing on net charge-off trends. The net charge-off rate was 3.16% compared to 5.15% last year. The reduction in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trend as customer payment behavior improved throughout 2020. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.54% with the increase to last year being primarily driven by the adoption of CECL in 2020 and the impact from COVID-19.  Moving to Slide 11, I will cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were $1 billion for the quarter, down $79 million or 7% from last year. The decrease was driven by lower purchase volume and average active accounts as well as reduction in employee costs and operational losses. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 34.8% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was partially offset by the reduction in employee costs and operational losses. Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during this uncertain and volatile period, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Deposits declined $2.3 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources were down $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. This resulted in deposits being 80% of our funding compared to 77% last year with securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.7 billion, which equated to 24.7% of our total assets, up from 22% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in March, which had 2 primary benefits. First, it delays the effects of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 15.9% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 180 basis points above last year's level of 14.1%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.8% under the CECL transition rules compared to 15.0% last year. The total capital ratio increased 180 basis points as well to 18.1%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 27.0% compared to 21.4% last year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing CECL. During the quarter, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. For the full year, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. As we finish 2020 and enter 2021, we have continued to assess the capital and liquidity strength of the company and the stability of our business at this point in the pandemic. With this backdrop, the Board has authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021, beginning in the first quarter. Repurchases are subject to our capital plan, and regulatory restrictions as well as overall market conditions, including any potential deterioration from the ongoing pandemic. Next, on Slide 13, we are providing a framework on key drivers for 2021. It goes without saying that the current environment will have periods of uncertainty and volatility until the pandemic is under control and resulting impact to the economic environment is more fully known. While our visibility is limited, we're providing this framework about how we are thinking about the year might unfold based on our best assessment as of today. These views assume that in the first half of the year, there is continuing pressure from the pandemic and a slow economic recovery. In the second half, we assume the pandemic is largely under control and economic recovery accelerates. First quarter purchase volume is expected to be consistent with the trends that developed at the end of 2020. Second quarter comparisons will obviously reflect the economic trough experienced in second quarter '20. The second half of the year, we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderate and macroeconomic growth accelerates.  Regarding loan receivable growth. In the first half, we expect continued higher payment rates from the stimulus actions to impact loan growth. In the second half of the year, we believe payment rates will slow as stimulus abates, and we returned to more normalized payment behavior patterns, combined with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment. These drivers will contribute to accelerating asset growth. For net interest margin, overall, we expect continued improvement as we enter 2021. Regarding the improvement in the first half we anticipate that higher payment rates will contribute to continued excess liquidity impacting asset mix. In the second half, excess liquidity is reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates, which drive normalized interest and fee yields leading to increasing NIM. With respect to our view on credit for the year, delinquencies are expected to increase with peak delinquencies occurring in third quarter 2021 and result in sequential quarter increases in net charge-offs. We would expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth and the impacts from any changes in the credit macroeconomic scenario. We anticipate a reserve release during 2021 as the credit macroeconomic environment develops. RSAs will remain elevated in the first half primarily reflecting the strong program performance, including revenue and net charge-offs. In the second half, we expect lower RSAs, generally reflecting the higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher revenue. As we outlined previously, we've implemented cost reductions across the organization. We believe this will result in expense reductions of approximately $210 million during the year. Partially offsetting these cost reductions will be expense increases relating to growth in addition to the anticipated increase in delinquent accounts. We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment and adjust as the landscape unfolds. As we enter 2021, we remain optimistic in the strength and the strategic position of our business to meet the challenges and exit the pandemic period in a stronger position than when we entered. We will continue to make investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure safety of our employees, while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and cardholders. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Margaret, first, just wanted to say that it's been a pleasure working with you over the last 7 years. I've really enjoyed the opportunity to learn from you and best of luck in your next role as Executive Chair. Margaret Keane : Thank you so much, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So maybe I'll kick it off a question for Brian Wenzel. So Brian, the RSA to loans was over 5% in the quarter, just given the better-than-expected credit. And I was wondering if maybe you could just give us a framework how to think about the RSA for 2021? If your base case that you outlined on the slide plays out, can we expect it to kind of remain in this 5% RSA to loans range before eventually dipping later in the year? Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Ryan. Obviously, the elevation that we've seen as we enter into 2021 was really driven by credit, which was 200 basis points better on net charge-offs. Slightly offset by -- or offset by some of the interest expense and NIM. But clearly, elevated. So I think as you slide into 2021, what you're going to see is as we continue to expect NIM to rise, there will be a benefit that will flow back through the RSA to the retailers pushing it upward. But then as credit normalizes, that will deflate it. So our expectation is it remains a little bit elevated. We would not expect that type of elevation at the end of the year as we exit out of 2021. And I think as you get into 2022 and beyond, it should be back into the normal type range that we've operated in pre-pandemic. Ryan Nash : Got it. And Brian Doubles, thank you for all the color on the equal payment strategy. Can you maybe just expand on the product offering and how you think it can evolve over time? So if I look, your products generally started around 3 months of financing. So I was wondering if there was potential, we could see some of these short-term products evolve into your own buy now pay later product? And second, just given some of the new players in the space are charging merchants pretty healthy fees for these products, can you maybe just talk about the pricing on merchant discount rates in some of your equal pay products? And can you maybe use pricing as a lever to drive volumes towards your offering and maybe away from some of these newer entrants? Brian Doubles : Yes, Ryan, that's a great question. I think you really got to take a step back and say, look, our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products that fit both what our partners want, but also what consumers are looking for. And obviously, buy now pay later is a trend that's not going away. Installment loans, a trend that's not going away. If you take a step back and you think about our business, we have such a broad set of partners that you really just can't have a one size fits all strategy. So as you know, Ryan, we sit down with each one of our partners, we sit down and say, okay, what are you trying to achieve? How can we help you drive sales, how can we help you communicate life cycle market to your customers? And that means that they will want to offer a variety of products. In some cases, a revolving product is going to make more sense. In some cases, an installment product is a better fit. If you think about bigger ticket products, that steers more towards longer-term installment, that can be on a revolving product or closed end. And then smaller ticket, the trend that we've seen recently is, that tends to steer more shorter-term and more shorter-term installment. And so again, it comes back to really what the partner wants at the end of the day. Now you make a really good point. Obviously, merchant discount pricing plays into this. The shorter you go and if you're not charging interest on the account, then obviously, you charge a higher merchant discount. And so again, it comes down to what the partner wants and what the consumer wants at the end of the day. Look, I feel great about the product set that we have. The one thing that I would not underestimate, though, is the product is really just one piece of the equation. What we've been working on and what's really important is, how do you embed the product in the shopping journey. And so that -- the way that we integrate is more important than ever. So it really comes down to features and capabilities, even more than the products. At the end of the day, these products are not that complex. It's really about how do we integrate, how do we embed the financing offer throughout the shopping journey. Operator : We have our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : My congratulations as well to all. I guess it's a little weird because the credit quality being so strong is affecting you guys a little bit more because you're sharing some of the upside there with the retailers. I'm just curious, as we have the stimulus benefit, like how much of the stimulus benefit is helping credit quality? And do you expect it to wear off at some point? Did you start to see it wear off a little bit in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to figure out sort of how stimulus -- how long you think credit sort of remains this favorable at this point in time, understanding your forecast that things might revert to the mean? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. So stimulus clearly has benefited. We've seen that throughout 2020, most certainly, we saw an influx of payments, right, when the most recent stimulus package hit. So payment rates actually elevated back higher in the early part of January. So clearly, stimulus is in effect, and you do see it wear off. Now what's interesting, more interesting about this latest stimulus is it's not surgical as much. It's going to a broad-based population. So the effectiveness as we continue to move on even with further stimulus, our portfolio shifted. We used to be 27% subprime, now we're 23% subprime. So the effects of that will not hold. So we do assume that when the stimulus burns off here, most certainly from the one in December, but if there's another stimulus that does get enacted in the first quarter, that will burn off, and you'll see payment rates elevate back, and then you'll see delinquencies come back into the portfolio. Well, certainly, we're expecting, given the high level of unemployment that delinquencies will build pretty quickly here as we move out. But again, we haven't seen that to date in the credit metrics that you have seen. So there is a chance, though, that with the future stimulus and if you get the pandemic under control, with the vaccine that you may flatten the ultimate loss curve here and have a bridge, which is what we would hope for. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. And maybe 1 for Brian Doubles, just on -- and Margaret, the Verizon and Venmo Card. I'm just curious, sort of -- I know they're an important part of the growth story at least over the intermediate period as we're waiting for offline to recover. I'm just curious if you're seeing progress and how they're doing relative to your expectations? Margaret Keane : Yes. I'd say both are doing really well. Verizon, we launched back in the summer, and again, it was our first launch during the pandemic. I think as we started out more online and as the stores have opened up, we're definitely seeing real positive momentum there. People are liking the value prop. So we feel really positive about our Verizon relationship and where that could be. On Venmo, we did the soft launch in the fall, that's gone also very well, and consumers are really liking how the product operates within the Venmo app. I think there's a lot of technology that both parties built out to make that really an integrated experience for consumers, and we are getting a lot of positive momentum there. As we roll out to the broader population soon, we expect that to continue to be a big part of our growth story as we go forward with the company. So 2 really exciting programs, 2 programs where technology and our investments have really paid off, and we look forward to continue to advance our investments in technology as we continue to integrate even further. Brian Doubles : Yes. The only thing I would add to that is I wouldn't gloss over Walgreens. We're really excited about that relationship, and I put that in the same category as Venmo and Verizon in terms of the opportunity for us. Sanjay, 90 million Walgreen loyalty customers, we're really excited about what that relationship can do for us as well. Operator : And we have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And congratulations, both Mar Margaret and Brian. And maybe just a follow-up on that exact question. And clearly, each of these is kind of independently large customer bases and large opportunities. But maybe is there a way to kind of discuss how the combination of the type of customer that has the loyalty to that particular brand and the value proposition kind of translate into a credit offering. And in some way, kind of thinking about the 3 of them and perhaps even ranking them in terms of how you see them kind of contributing to growth at Synchrony? Margaret Keane : Yes. I don't know if we could rank them yet because it's still early. But I'd say that our experience has always been that customers can compartmentalize them. So if you think about Venmo, I think that's going to become more of an everyday use card, particularly with folks that use that app all day long. And we think as it's integrated into that payment mechanism, and the ability to really split payments and actually experience that back and forth between how people spend. But I think the big opportunity on Venmo really is the fact that you can use that card now in broader merchants. So I think as the QR code becomes more of a go-to type of technology, it's still not where it needs to be but we think that's really the other big opportunity with Venmo. So you have the in-app experience where people are working together to purchase things. But then in-store or the QR code opportunity presents a whole different -- I think, different set of experiences and maybe broaden stack customer base for us. So we're excited about that. On the other 2, it really is the value prop that I think makes another big difference where for Walgreens, what we do know, and we know this through CareCredit that people do compartmentalize their healthcare spend. And as consumers are being asked to really bear a bigger burden on healthcare spends -- spend, we view this card to be a great way for us to enter into the broader space of healthcare. You know that's been part of our strategy. I should also say that it's building on the relationship we already had with Walgreens because we already had the card -- the CareCredit card accepted in Walgreens. Now this is really tying our card with their value prop, connecting the 2 together and really allowing customers who have healthcare needs and wellness needs to really leverage that and then get the rewards. And then again, we're going to work towards making all this digital. So it's a really seamless, frictionless experience for the consumer. And then Verizon is really -- I think the value prop on Verizon in terms of how you use Verizon, I think all -- I joke all the time for those who -- I'm old, so I have kids who are old, they're still on my plan. You never really get the kids off the plan, by the way, leveraging that value prop and using that towards your bill, I think, is another really positive momentum that we're seeing. So we think all 3 of these programs have real growth potential. I think it really demonstrates for us our ability to really be agile in a very difficult environment to roll out during the pandemic and to really meet the needs of what I would say are really strong value props, leveraging technology. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And I certainly know what you mean about the phone plan. As a follow-up question there. Given -- Brian Wenzel, given what you talked about in terms of the capital positioning, how strong it is. And I mean, simply, I mean, you guys earned over $1 billion this past year and the balance sheet shrunk. And so how do you relate the $1.6 billion of buyback authorization to that? I mean, it feels like that could get stronger over time and maybe just kind of talk about how that was developed? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So it's important to note that the announcement that we made and the Board authorized is slightly different than we\u2019ve historically done. This is for a calendar year. Obviously, the Fed has put some restrictions in for the first quarter, but we're going to go through our process. We've been going through a quarterly process from a governance perspective, looking at loss stresses, looking at the way our balance sheet will perform. And I think if you go back a quarter, we weren't sure we'd be in this position to start the year. We were thinking more back half of the year. But I think as we talked with the Board, we recognized the strength in the capital and liquidity of the company, we recognized the stability of the company as we progressed through the back half of 2020. As we look into 2021, we -- again, it's uncertain. There's going to be volatility, but we're optimistic that the pandemic comes under control in the first half and that the macroeconomic piece picks up. So we thought it was prudent to start. We'll go through a process and submit our formal capital plan to the Fed at the end of March, beginning of April. And then we'll circle back with what that amount is. We think that's a prudent amount, right, given this is a transitional year, right, relative to the visibility and uncertainty. So obviously, we haven't changed our long-term view with regards to capital and where we want to get to. It's just really the pace. And so we're comfortable that this is a good place to start, and we can always revisit as we move through the year. Operator : We have our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : And also, let me add my congratulations to both Margaret and Brian. Maybe we can -- I wanted to start with -- maybe just going back to your comments on Walgreens, I guess my first question just really to clarify, is it going to sit in CareCredit or is it going to be in your Retail Card sector? Because it looked like from your release, it was in CareCredit. And then my follow-up on that would just be, are there -- is there any implication of that? Because I think historically, your CareCredit has had no RSA or a lot lower RSA. And just in terms of the program, is there something we should be thinking about specific to Walgreens, which makes it different than a typical co-brand or Retail Card program? Margaret Keane : Well, I'll start and then Brian can talk about the RSA. But look, I think one of the things that we have said for a while now is that we believe that we have a unique insight into the whole healthcare wellness space given our CareCredit platform. We've expanded that platform all through last year as we've expanded into hospital network through just our acquisition of Allegra Credit. We believe that consumers -- and by the way, it does sit in CareCredit. So I should clarify that. Does sit in CareCredit. We believe that the everyday spend around wellness is an area where consumers are looking for rewards. We believe Walgreens is a great partner because we were already in there accepting the Walgreen -- the CareCredit card. So we believe this space is a real ripe opportunity because of our unique knowledge and experience in this space for over 30 years, and we really see Walgreens as a way for us to really continue to expand and differentiate ourselves in the healthcare business. I don't know, Brian, if you'd mentioned the RSA. Brian Doubles : Yes. So the one thing I'd add on to Margaret's comments is when you think about the capabilities, we already have a CareCredit dual card that operates there. And we'll certainly -- while we're a big business, the ability for us to really take the tools, technology, talent that exists in that, manages the co-band relationships inside the Retail Card will most certainly partner with those folks combining the healthcare and knowledge of that. We have in other platforms, so in the payment solutions platform, we do have some limited RSA. So you would see some RSA here, but again, that's a $10 billion platform for us. So I wouldn't consider it to be material most certainly in the early part here. So -- but you will see some develop over time there. Mihir Bhatia : Understood. And then if I -- just my other question was just going to be on capital and going back to some of your comments on deploying capital and getting your capital ratios closer to your peers, I feel like you had excess liquidity the entire time you've been public. So I guess, is there an opportunity or interest in deploying some of that capital via portfolio acquisitions or through other inorganic growth, whether it's M&A or something else that we should be thinking about? Or do you just feel like you have enough on your hands between Walgreens, Venmo, Verizon, the economy reopening, that near term, that's probably more what we should be focused on? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Great question. When we think about the capital priorities of the company, the first priority for us is the organic growth that we have. So when you think about some of the longer standing existing programs, whether it's an Amazon or PayPal or TJX, Sam's, Lowe's, there's lots of opportunity to continue our penetration march there. These newer programs, Verizon, Venmo, Walgreens will most certainly -- we'd like to deploy capital into that. So that's our first priority to grow that piece. But we will have capital beyond that ability to grow the book. If you think about the capital generation of the business, you think about the resiliency and the return, you think about the resiliency of the RSA, we will have excess capital, which then our next priority is to maintain our dividend and provide that back to shareholders. And then beyond that, we believe there will be excess that will be deployed first in share repurchase to the extent that we find an acquisition that makes sense, whether it be a portfolio or businesses, we'll look to do that. Margaret Keane : I think that was demonstrated this quarter by the acquisition of Allegro. So if the right opportunity comes along, that fits with our long-term strategy and is at the right return for us, we certainly are looking at those opportunities should they come forward. Brian Wenzel : And that's the key point. Still in this part of the cycle, I'm not sure valuations have checked up enough where we would do something large. But to the extent that they do and an opportunity exists, we would gladly deploy that capital for the long-term value creation. Operator : We have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Brian, we're getting more questions around regulation, and I just wanted to sort of get your perspective on how you're thinking about that risk? And is there any parts of your business that could become more of a focus from mostly the CFPB et cetera? Margaret Keane : Yes, Don, I'll take that. It's -- we are -- I'm assuming this is in relation to the new administration. I would say we've been around for a really long time. We've had all administrations. We feel confident that even in the new administration, we'd be able to manage through any changes that they may make. I think we feel like we're well positioned. And look, I think the regulation and the focus is really always on this whole idea of being fair and transparent to consumers and I think that's our job. So we have the infrastructure in place, we have the people in place. We're trying to ensure we're doing all the right things from a consumer perspective and also working with our partners in this as well. So we're not overly concerned. I mean, look, there'll probably be more things coming out, but we'll adjust as we have to. Operator : We have our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Margaret, it's been such a pleasure working with you. And I know you're still going to have like fantastic influence over at Synchrony in your new role. But thanks very much for all the time that you've given us over the years. And Brian, looking forward to even working with you closer. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Betsy. Margaret Keane : Thank you very much. Betsy Graseck : Okay. A couple of questions on SetPay. Just wanted to see if you could give us some color on the take-up rate at your partners and things like what percentage have been rolled out to? How much do you think you can push that in 2021, which is a period where I think you're going to see some of the pure-play guys really push hard to get into merchants? So want to get an understanding of that from you? And whether or not the partners that you have today with another being PL platform can add SetPay on top of that? Or do you have to wait for their programs to come up for RFP in a few years? Just some color there would be helpful. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Betsy. It really does come down to the individual partner and what they're trying to achieve. And I think obviously, this is a hot topic. That's why we put a slide in the deck today just to kind of lay out in more detail how much of this business we actually do today. I don't think it's well-known that we have $15 billion of balances that are on equal pay products, both short and long-term. And I think it really does come down to partner choice. So as I said, we sit down with each one of our partners, in some cases, they love the idea of an equal pay product because that's what the consumer wants. That's what their customer wants, but they want to put it on a revolving product. And part of the reason for that is it gives them an ongoing relationship with the customer, right? It allows them to drive the repeat usage. It allows them to do the life cycle marketing. All of those things that are really important to our partners and that, frankly, they've been trying to drive for the last 5 or 6 years. We always talk to you about how much reuse we get on the card. And that's a big priority for our partners is creating that lasting relationship with their customer. And then we also have some customers that, depending on their customer base and the types of products they sell, that they're actually interested in more of a short-term closed end installment product. And so we're able to provide that as well through SetPay, and we can do that very short-term, we can do it longer term. But it really is customized for the individual partner in terms of what they're trying to achieve. The one thing I can tell you is we are seeing slightly higher growth rates on those installment products than we're seeing on the other products in the portfolio, which I think is good news. I mean, we absolutely have to stay ahead of that curve. It's rapidly evolving. But the product is just one piece of the equation. I touched on this earlier, what our partners really want to make sure we can do. And this is very different depending on the types of partners is how do we integrate into their digital point of sale. And if I look across the investments that we're making in the company, that's one of the biggest ones. So it's not enough just to have the product, actually having the product is the easier part in a lot of cases. But how do you integrate seamlessly inside of all of our partners' digital assets. So how do you do that online? How do you do it in their mobile app? And you can imagine, given the breadth of our partner base, we have to have solutions that customize for each of those individual partners. And so it really is more about the experience than the actual product at the end of the day. Did I answer your question? Betsy Graseck : Yes, I guess the -- my underlying question here is do you anticipate -- I understand that you have a significant amount of balances on this equal pay product today. SetPay is a slightly different tone to that, a slightly different offering. And I'm wondering if this is, in your opinion, 2021 is a year where that take up by your partners is going to be explosive or is this normal course for you? And there -- we really shouldn't expect to see that much difference in how your partners interact with you on the equal pay product? Brian Doubles : I think you're definitely going to see higher growth rates in SetPay than you see kind of broadly across other products. With that said, I wouldn't consider it explosive growth because it really comes down to what the partner is trying to achieve at the end of the day. And we do have some partners that are very focused on a strategy where they like the equal pay product, but they'd like to see us sit on a revolving account where they can continue to drive the repeat usage and continue to have that ongoing relationship. Margaret Keane : And I think the other piece is customer choice, right? What does the customer really want? Brian Doubles : Yes. And for some\u2026 Margaret Keane : Our job is to really offer the products and position them in the right way to the consumer so that they can have consumer choice. And I think one of the things we're very focused on is making sure that's integrated in our digital assets. So it's a choice for a customer. Brian Doubles : Yes. At the end of the day, it comes down to what our partners want and what the consumers want. And again, given the breadth of our partners, we have to be able to provide a very full product suite revolving short-term, long-term installment, and we'll be able to do that. But it does come down to the partner and what the customer wants. Operator : We have our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : I also add my congrats to you both, Margaret and Brian. You have a lot of great new programs that you're investing in as you look to the resumption of growth in new and active accounts coming out of this. But can you give a bit more color on how you're gauging what the right level of investment is, your guidance for operating expenses calls for higher investments, but maybe you can give a little bit more context, maybe in terms of an efficiency ratio? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Bill. So we've continued -- even during a pandemic, different than a lot of our peers, we did not slow down any of the investments, whether it was in technology or in resources we've allocated towards these growth initiatives, we reprioritized certain things inside of that, that were greater short-term opportunities. So we've maintained that so for us, we're going to continue to invest. I mean, 2020 was a big year for us when you think about the investment to stand up a Venmo and Verizon. And again, we're looking forward to a full Venmo launch here in 2021. So we've invested quite a bit. Walgreens comes right behind this. We continue to drive core productivity in which we're continuing the investment. And again, the way we're positioning the company for the longer term, Bill, is to look at -- if I'm thinking out 2025, what is an above-average ROA, and we're going to drive that efficiency ratio back down into a range where it has been more historically but really delivers that ROA given the revenue mix and loss content that we see in that portfolio mix. That being said, we are going to find ways in order to either increase the margin of the portfolios or to drive incremental costs out to maintain and perhaps expand that investment technology. That is something that we want to do and we feel we need to do for the medium and long-term. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful. Separately, on capital, can you give a little bit of more color on how you guys are thinking about the CECL and CARES Act phase-ins on your ability to return excess capital? And I guess, just is there a possibility that we could see you guys increase that $1.6 billion authorization under a favorable macro scenario where you guys end up releasing a sizable amount of reserves as we progress through 2021? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So let me unpack that. The first piece in all our modeling as we move through '20 and really '21, we've always modeled in the transition adjustment relative to CECL and, most certainly, that would come out of -- we view the capital generation in those years as we move out. This is roughly around, I think, 60 basis points assuming that the rules stay intact. We are continuing, to be honest with you, engage with dialogues with our stakeholders about a form of permanent capital relief because we obviously believe that when you look at our Tier 1 plus reserves at 27% that is very high, where we are and that we believe that there should be credit, whether it sits in Tier 2 or in Tier 1 relative to CECL. So that's always been a factor as part of our plans and shouldn't really impact it.  With regard to your second part of your question, that the improvement in the macroeconomic scenario, most certainly, we're not tied to the $1.6 billion. That's where we view it today. We're going to go through our capital planning process here in the first quarter and get our capital plan approved by the Board in March, submit it in April. And then hopefully, we'll come back to you in the second quarter with a fuller perspective. But there is a scenario where clearly we can return potentially more capital. I think right now, $1.6 billion is we're sitting January 29 and transition in a year that is a little bit uncertain is not a bad place to start the year at. So we're going to continue to monitor the same way of quarter out. We thought we weren't going to do anything until the back half of this year. So we'll continue to evaluate it, Bill. Kathryn Miller : Vanessa, we have 5 more people in the queue, but time for only 1 more question. Operator : We have our last question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Congratulations, Margaret and Brian, and welcome, Kathryn. A question -- another question on the RSA. I'm just wondering, I mean, because we can look back at historical average levels and understand it may be elevated because of the charge-off cycle. Number 1 is, is there anything different, like where that maybe our average RSA should sit over time? I don't look where it was, it sounds like there might be some modest change because of the Walmart transition. But is there anything else that would change the long-term kind of average RSA levels? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, John. So the simple answer is no. I mean, Walmart, clearly, if you strip that out, we'll push the RSA higher because it operated at a lower RSA level than the company average. Absent that, there's nothing fundamental. I think what's challenging people, and I can appreciate it from an outside-in perspective is CECL has dramatically impacted the profitability of the company. And it's very difficult. We've lagged CECL, but when you don't see delinquency formation at a retail partner, it's difficult to go to them and say, okay, even though I haven't seen delinquencies, they're going to come at some point, here's $100 million, $200 million. So that is unfortunately pushing the RSA higher here. And then when you look at credit really outperforming the loss in NIM, we have a highest RSA. I think when you look at it over time, if you look at '20 and '21 combined together, it's going to get back down the average. And most certainly, as we exit the pandemic, there's nothing structurally that they should operate at different level ex the Walmart impact. John Hecht : And my last question is -- and you've talked about some of the new products, and I fully appreciate the customer-centric focus of the new products. At what point do though the kind of mix of the new products start to impact, call it, the economics of your business? I mean, for instance, the closed end product might have a bigger merchant discount that would flow through a different -- I imagine a different line item in your P&L. So at what point should we envision changes in that mix? And what might that -- like what form might that take? Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, John. I'll just start on that. I mean, look, as you know, we are pretty disciplined around pricing. And I think we try and maintain pricing that gives us an overall and attractive return either for the program or the product that we're underwriting. And so that will remain consistent. I think there are certainly trade-offs. And I think how you earn on these products is a little bit different. Obviously, shorter-dated promotions, you're maybe getting more merchant discount, you're getting less off of the APR or the consumer. But I wouldn't see having a material impact on our overall profitability return, longer term, you might just see the components change, which, as you know, both of those run through net interest income. So I don't think you wouldn't see it have a significant impact there. I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything. Brian Wenzel : Yes. The only -- I mean, John, we have $81 billion in assets. So I think to try to move metrics materially, this would have to be incredibly large. I mean, obviously, you see growth rates in much smaller competitors. But at $81 billion, it shouldn't have a material effect relative to most certainly short and medium-term with the way our P&L is constructive. Brian Doubles : I think the best way to think about it is these are going to be really attractive avenues for growth for us longer term. This whole product strategy, we do a lot more of this business than I think people realize. I think we -- obviously, we're well-known for revolving credit, but we do a lot of installment. It's something we're very comfortable underwriting. We're very comfortable with pricing. And like I said, we're seeing a little bit better growth there than the other products that we have. So I think that's exciting at the end of the day. Again, it comes down to partner and customer choice, and we're in a position to be able to provide whatever that solution is for our partners that they want. Operator : And thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Brian Doubles : Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. It is truly an honor and a privilege to talk to you today for the first time as the CEO of Synchrony. Building on our strong foundation, I believe Synchrony is exceptionally well-positioned for this next chapter of our growth journey. There is strong momentum in the business driven by the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the unwavering hard work and commitment of our people. While this past year has been challenging and unprecedented in many ways, we are starting to see positive signs of recovery. And we are seeing the benefits of the strategic initiatives that we accelerated in the new programs that we launched last year. I\u2019m very optimistic and excited about the opportunities ahead and I\u2019m honored to lead Synchrony into the future. And with that, I\u2019d like to get into some of the highlights of our first quarter results. Earnings were $1 billion or $1.73 per diluted share an increase of 1.28 over the last year. The resilience of our business has been evident as we navigated the pandemic. From the underlying fundamentals of our business, including diverse programs and networks and solid underwriting to our ability to quickly adapt to meet the moment with easily integrated seamless digital solutions. We have demonstrated that our business is structured to execute even in the most challenging operating environments. And as we begin to emerge from this challenging period, we have seen many of our growth drivers outperform pre-pandemic levels experienced during the first quarter of last year. Importantly, purchase volume increased a strong 8% over last year with a substantial increase in purchase volume per account of 18%. While we\u2019re seeing strong trends on purchase volume, loan receivables were down 7% to $76.9 billion given elevated payment rates with the infusion of additional stimulus this quarter. The average balances per account have rebounded increasing 1% over the first quarter of last year as have new accounts, which were up 3%. Net interest margin was down 117 basis points to 13.98% as further stimulus continued to elevate payment rates, which lowered our receivable mix and yield. The efficiency ratio was 36.1% for the quarter. We are on track with our strategic plans to reduce our expense base and moving $210 million of expenses by the end of the year. Credit continued to perform exceedingly well. The net charge-offs of 3.62% this quarter, compared to 5.36% last year. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet deposits were down $1.9 billion or 3% versus last year. Given our excess liquidity, we have been slowing our overall deposit growth. Total deposits comprised 81% of our funding as our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attracted to the positives and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. During the quarter, we returned $328 million in capital through share repurchases of $200 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. We continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities across our platforms, but we are getting very disciplined around risk and returns, it is critical to ensure that our partnerships are structured with strong alignment that benefits both parties. Having said that, as we previously announced, we will not renew our partnership with the GAAP as we were not able to reach terms that made sense for our company. We expect that exiting this partnership and redeploying the capital will be EPS neutral relative to current program economics and accretive to propose renewal terms. We have been on a journey to grow with partners who leverage our digital capabilities to help them drive sales and meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers. Our ability to win programs with transformational digital innovation has been demonstrated with a number of recent wins. These capabilities are also integral to the success of all of our programs as consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our vast digital assets as well as our strong data analytics capabilities to make the entire consumer experience more personalized and meaningful. We have continued to expand our digital penetration across the customer journey from apply, to buy, to servicing. Approximately 60% of our applications were done digitally during the first quarter and we grew 14% in mobile channel applications. In retail card 50% of our sales occurred online and approximately 65% of payments were made digitally. The investments we are making in digital and data analytics continue to payoff. During the quarter, we renewed 10 programs, including American Eagle, Ashley HomeStores, CITGO, and Phillips 66. We also added 10 new programs including Prime Healthcare, Mercyhealth, and Emory Healthcare, which furthers our penetration of health systems. We\u2019re also expanding the utility of our CareCredit card. Our patient financing app is now available on the Epic App Orchard. This makes CareCredit available to hundreds of health care organizations using Epic\u2019s MyChart and enabling cardholders to use CareCredit to take co-pays deductibles and medical expenses not covered by insurance. Not only does this technology integration provide a way to increase the usage and acceptance of CareCredit, but also helps health services and hospital providers on efficient, financially healthy organizations by helping to improve revenue cycle management and reduce debt risk. We are excited by the prospects to support patients beyond elective care as we expand to offer payment options for non-elective medical expenses in routine care. I\u2019ll spend a few minutes today outlining our CareCredit strategy and providing a framework to think about the opportunities that lie ahead. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve been transforming CareCredit to become a more comprehensive solution for consumer financing and payments in health care, pet care and wellness by expanding our relationships with providers, retailers, payers and pharmacies. We have unparalleled scale and depth in this space. With $9.3 billion of receivables and acceptance of approximately 250,000 enrolled provider, health and wellness retail locations. The card is used by more than 8 million cardholders. We are in more than 80% of dental offices nationwide and over 40 health care specialties, 13 of which we entered into since 2018. We see big opportunity in health systems and hospitals and have rapidly expanded our reach by launching eight new programs in 2020, bringing our total to 13. With the growth in our pet vertical, we are now in over 85% of that practices and have grown pets in force by 174% since our acquisition of the Pets Best Insurance business two years ago. A big part of our success is the engagement we have with our cardholders. Our cardholders give us high marks as we have increased our customer satisfaction score to 92% from 78% back in 2009. Our Net Promoter Score is nearly double the credit card industry average. And as proof of the value our cardholders place on the card, we\u2019ve been able to increase our repeat sales to nearly 60%. That is a testament to the hard work that we put into creating a strong value proposition for the card and for increasing utility as we build our network, one office and provider at a time. And our growth numbers reflect these efforts and the position we hold in this space. Our receivables have increased 44% in seven years. We have also increased the breadth of our business with an increase in provider locations of 41% in that time frame, and active accounts currently stand at $5.7 million, another double-digit increase in seven years. We have built an incredible platform for growth we are in an enviable position as we chart the course forward, continuing to evolve to capture further opportunity. There is still tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock growth in dental, veterinary and specialty industries. We are making investments to simplify the customer and provider experience and leveraging technology to support more consumer-driven, self service capabilities. We have ample room for growth with increased penetration among our existing partners and through innovation to make it increasingly easy to engage with our network. Just recently, we acquired Allegro Credit, which has both deepened our penetration in audiology and other industries while also enabling new products and capabilities. With a steady increase in out-of-pocket health care costs and the popularity of high deductible health care plans, consumers are assuming more of the financial responsibility for their health care. This translates to a significant opportunity of more than $405 billion in out-of-pocket health expenditures in the U.S. but flexible and extended financing is only a small component of overall health care payments, so there is significant runway for growth. .: Further, we have expanded our utility, creating more ways to access health care services by partnering with pharmacies. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 17,000 pharmacies nationwide, and we recently announced that we will become the issuer of the Walgreens co-branded credit card program in the U.S. The first such credit program in the retail health sector and expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021. We are also transforming our pet business to be a more comprehensive financial solution provider and to meet the needs of pet parents throughout their pet care journey. Now more than ever, Americans are invested in their pets. With both pet ownership and cost increasing significantly over the past several years, and that trend grew even more during the pandemic. Americans spend more than $100 billion on pet expenditures. There is a large market outside of that practices with significant opportunity to provide new products, financing alternatives and services. CareCredit supports a lifetime of care for pets and with the acquisition of Pets Best Insurance, we currently offer a complementary solution with veterinary care to support pet owners with simple, flexible financial options. We continue to integrate the Pets Best Insurance offering to capitalize on the payment and customer experience synergies. We\u2019re also looking for ways to expand into other pet adjacencies through products and services and retail. By focusing on the needs of our partners and customers and bringing substantial scale and expertise, we believe we will drive loyalty to the CareCredit network and as a result, should see outsized growth in the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This is an important period of time for our company and the world as we continue to emerge from the pandemic. Our business and the actions we have taken over the past year leave us well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities, which lie ahead of us. I share Brian\u2019s sentiment of appreciation on the unwavering commitment of our people, I want to thank all those involved in development, delivery and administration of vaccines to help us emerge from this incredibly difficult period of time. I\u2019ll now provide an update on our first quarter results. The pandemic and resultant government stimulus actions have impacted several key areas of our business over the past year. However, our business mix has helped us to mitigate some impact from the pandemic as certain areas have performed very well, including digital, home related products and services, veterinary services, electronics and appliances. Performance in these areas have provided support against the overall effects of the economic downturn as we exit the first quarter, we are starting to see greater signs of economic recovery more broadly. Purchase volume increased 8% versus last year and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. From a macroeconomic perspective, we have seen consumer confidence reach a one-year high in March, unemployment continued to improve and easing of some of the remaining local restrictions. This is evident in the increase in purchase volume per account, which is up 18% over last year. Average active accounts were down 8%, which marks a slowing in the rate of decline, it remains impacted by the macroeconomic effects of pandemic in 2020 and uneven recovery in the first quarter. We did originate over 5 million new accounts, an increase of 3% versus first quarter 2020, which is a positive sign and reflective of improved consumer sentiment. Loan receivables declined 7%, which was worse than our expectations. The driver was higher-than-expected elevation and payment rates, which resulted primarily from the recently enacted stimulus. Interest and fees on loans were down 14% from last year, driven by the elevated payment rate in addition to lower delinquencies. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 38% of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased 6% in the prior year. On loan receivable basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year. Overall, we saw positive momentum in several of our growth metrics this quarter, where higher payment rates is impacting loan receivable growth. While we\u2019re still cautious about the state of the pandemic with the recent rise of in confirmed cases, we are encouraged by the progress made with the national rollout of the vaccine and lifting some of the remaining restrictions. We remain optimistic of the positive momentum and continued improvement as we progress through 2021. RSAs increased $63 million or 7% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.1% for the quarter. This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs. We reduced our loan loss reserves this quarter due to an improved macroeconomic outlook in line with the decline in loan receivables. This coupled with lower net charge-offs resulted in a significant decrease in the provision for credit losses of $1.3 billion or 80% from last year. Other income increased $34 million, mainly due to investment income. Other expense decreased $70 million or 7% from last year due to lower operational losses and lower marketing costs, partially offset by an increase in employee costs. Moving to our platform results on Slide 9. Our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to the pandemic restrictions and elevated payment rates. Their trajectories have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hardline goods. We have seen broad-based momentum in purchase volume as consumers become increasingly confident as we begin to exit the pandemic. In Retail Card, loan receivables declined 9%, but showed momentum with purchase volume increasing 11% versus last year. Average active accounts were down 7% and interest and fees were down 16% due to the impact from the pandemic. We\u2019re excited with our renewal of the American Eagle program and continue to see significant opportunity with our recently launched programs with Verizon and Venmo as those programs begin to build. The strength of our Power Sports and Home Specialty and Payment Solutions continue to help offset some of the impact from pandemic shutdowns and higher payment rates. During the quarter, loan receivables declined 1% and average active accounts were down 9%. Interest and fees were down 11%, which was driven primarily by lower late fees, finance charges, and merchant discount, all the resulted reduction in loan receivables. We did see positive momentum in purchase volume, which was up 3% over last year. Our focus on growing this platform resulted in several new programs being signed and renewed key partnerships, including Ashley Home furniture during the quarter. We continue to drive organic growth through our partnerships and networks and added 3,900 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 34% purchase volume excluding oil and gas. Although, CareCredit sustained the largest overall impact from the pandemic restrictions, improvement in this platform has continued into 2021 as providers have increased, elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter of last year. This improvement is evident in our purchase volume being flat to last year. Loan receivables were down 8% this quarter and drove a decrease in interest and fees on loans of 7% as we recorded lower late fees and merchant discounts. During the quarter, we continue to grow our CareCredit network, enhance the utility of our card. The expansion of our network and acceptance strategy has helped us drive the reuse rate to 59% of purchase volume in the first quarter. This is a powerful growth platform for our business and remain excited about the opportunities to drive future growth as the impact of the pandemic subsides. I\u2019ll move to Slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, recently enacted stimulus contributed to an elevation of payment rates, which were up about 2 percentage points on average compared to the average payment rates we experienced pre-pandemic. The difference was as high as 3.5 percentage points in March, when the most recent stimulus plan was enacted. This has resulted in a reduction in loan receivables, which has had an impact on net interest income and net interest margin in the first quarter. Net interest income decreased 12% from last year, driven by lower finance charges and late fees. The net interest margin was 13.98% compared to last year\u2019s margin of 15.15%, largely driven by the impact of the pandemic on loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the loan receivables yield of 19.32% was down 135 basis points versus last year and was the primary driver of 117 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined over 3 percentage points from 81.7% to 78.6%, driven by the higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 61 basis points of the net interest margin decline. The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 23 basis points reduction in our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by 93 basis point decrease in the total interest-bearing liabilities costs to 1.57%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 78 basis point increase in our net interest margin. We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, excess liquidity will begin to be deployed into asset growth and slowing paying rates should result in higher interest and fee yields leading to increasing net interest margin. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I start with the delinquency trends. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.83% compared to 4.24% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.52% compared to 2.10% last year. Higher payment rates continue to drive delinquency improvements. Focusing on net charge-off trends, our net charge-off rate was 3.62% compared to 5.36% last year. Our reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the improving delinquency trends as customer payment behavior improved over the last several quarters. Our loss for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.88%. Moving to Slide 12, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were down $70 million or 7% from last year to $932 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce cost. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses and lower marketing and business development costs, partially offset by higher employee costs. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 36.1% compared to 32.7% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses. Moving to Slide 13. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. But we believe it\u2019s prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined by $1.9 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.1 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 79% last year. The securitized funding comprising 9% and unsecured funding comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $28 billion, which equated to 29.2% of our total assets, up from 25.3% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two primary benefits. First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years. And second, it allows for a portion of current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 310 basis points above last year\u2019s level of 14.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.3% under the CECL transition rules compared to 15.2% last year. The total capital ratio increased 320 basis points to 19.7%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased in basis increased to 28.7% compared to 24.1% last year, reflecting the increase in the reserves as a result of implementing CECL. During the quarter, we returned $328 million to shareholders, which included $200 million of share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. Given the continued uncertainty in the operating environment, I thought it\u2019d be helpful to provide color on our current view on the key earnings drivers for 2021, which we\u2019ve laid out on Slide 14. Our views assume that the pressure from the pandemic and a slower economic recovery continues into the second quarter with the second half seeing the pandemic largely under control and the acceleration of the economic recovery. First quarter purchase volume was stronger than anticipated as we entered the year, as local restrictions are lifted with consumer confidence improving so to consumers\u2019 willingness to spend. We currently believe these trends will hold and purchase volume will continue to recover across our platforms. In the second quarter, we will be comparing against a period of widespread shutdowns. In the second half, we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates. Regarding loan receivable growth, we expect that stimulus will continue to have an impact on payment rates, and therefore, loan receivables into the next quarter. In the second half of 2021, we assume payment rates will moderate as the effects of the stimulus abates and we return to more normalized consumer payment behavior patterns. Combining this with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment, this should contribute to loan receivable growth. For net interest margin, we expect the higher payment rates will continue to pressure loan receivables and generate excess liquidity, impacting interest and fee yield and asset mix. We continue to believe that excess liquidity will be reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates in the second half of the year, which will drive improving interest and fee yields and asset mix leading to increase in net interest margin. With respect to credit, delinquencies are expect to increase from the current levels. So, we now believe the peak will occur later than we anticipated, likely in early 2022. While current delinquencies will result in lower net charge-offs in the second quarter, we expect net charge-offs to rise resulting from the increases in delinquencies as we move through 2021. Given the magnitude of the stimulus that was deployed during pandemic, we believe the overall loss curve will be flatter than we initially thought that remains volatile and difficult to forecast due to the effects of the stimulus and industry forbearance has abated. We expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth, impact from any rate changes in credit and in our macroeconomic assumptions and certain combinations of these factors could result in further reserve releases this year. We expect RSAs to remain elevated into the second quarter, primarily reflecting strong program performance, including an improvement in net charge-offs, partially offset by lower revenue. In the second half of the year, we continue to expect lower RSAs generally, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher revenue. As we outlined previously, we\u2019ve implemented cost reductions across the organization and I\u2019m pleased to report that we are on a pace to achieve our expense savings target of $210 million for the full year. Partially offsetting these cost reductions will be the expense increases related to growth in addition to anticipated increase in delinquent accounts. We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and to impacting the macroeconomic environment. At the foundation is our belief that we position ourselves well for the opportunities that will develop as the economic recovery takes from hold. Further, we\u2019ve made the investments to support our partners as they have been required to rapidly transform their businesses to meet the new digital realities. And we\u2019ll continue to make investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure the safety of our employees, while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and cardholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll provide a quick overview of key themes for the quarter and then turn it over, so we can begin Q&A. Clearly, the pandemic has had significant impacts and has, in many ways, changed the way we did business. This quarter made it evidence that we are beginning to emerge on other side of this period. Consumer sentiment has improved. The unemployment rate has dropped and U.S. retail posted the largest gain in 10 months. Our business is showing its resilience as growth has accelerated with purchase volume of 8% and 5 million new accounts opened this quarter. And although, the solid growth metrics were tamped down by higher payment rates, which impacted loan receivables and NIM, these are headwinds that we anticipate will soon abate. Credit performance has continued to outperform and we continue to expand our CareCredit network, delivering new products, financing alternatives and experiences with a focus on overall wellness impact. The bottom line is that we demonstrated that we were able to rapidly adapt to operate in a new environment, while continuing to keep our eye on the long-term positioning ourselves well for the future. And in my opinion, we had never been in a stronger position. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Jennifer to open the Q&A. Jennifer Church : That concludes our comments for the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Brian, I was hoping that you could talk just a little bit about the \u2013 about this return to normalcy with respect to things like late fees and how that\u2019s impacted the net interest margin and the timing, as well as perhaps the prepay speeds, like what are the actual, besides the injections of stimulus, the ongoing effects, like, how should we think about the timeframe for both of those to get back to something approximating normal? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Moshe, and good morning. So, yes, clearly, we\u2019ve seen the headwind relative to stimulus. We saw the cash flow really start back in mid-March around the [indiscernible] stimulus are started to hit. So from there, we continue to see elevated payments, they\u2019re starting to trend down a little bit now, as we get into latter part of April, obviously, we have a converging factor with tax returns. So stimulus, clearly, is the number one factor. When you think about the late fees, if you went back and looked at our number of delinquent accounts, they\u2019re down over 30% from the 2019 period, so pre-pandemic. So again, as you think about a rising net charge-off or even just the return to normalcy, when you think about the charge-off environment that late fee yield will come back into the book and come in advance of when the charge-offs actually hit. So we would expect to see that yield begin to increase in the back half of the year. What I\u2019d say, Moshe, is lot of people focus on the margins of business. We\u2019re at 14% today. We\u2019ve kind of guided people to, call it, the 16% range in a normalized environment. If you break down the components of that for a second, the first piece is really the excess liquidity, which I started with the stimulus factors, right. So if you went back and looked at excess liquidity pre-pandemic, applied that to the book today, you\u2019ll probably pick up about 90 basis points of net interest margin from there. We previously talked about there\u2019s probably 25 or so basis points, 30 basis points in the benchmark rates, which we\u2019ll see how prime comes. And the residual amount, right, which is the mainly late fee yield and interest yield. We\u2019ll come back into the book and that will rise. So I think you can see a trajectory where this begins to accelerate in the back half of the year and begins to approach normalcy for us as we move into 2022. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And as a follow-up, you mentioned the 5 million new accounts, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s still with kind of sluggish retail openings. Can that number get better in any update that you can give us on the Verizon and Venmo programs specifically? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Moshe, this is Brian Doubles. I think we would certainly expect that number to continue to grow. We\u2019re not in a fully open economy right now, as you know, I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons to be bullish, when you look at a consumer, you look at the trends on jobs, unemployment back to 6% and then consumer balance sheets are strong and they\u2019re starting to spend again. I think the fact that we saw 8% purchase volume growth and 11% of retail card is a really positive indicator. But that\u2019s not where it should be in a fully functioning open economy. And so I think there\u2019s still room across all the growth metrics to go further from here. We\u2019re still in the early innings in terms of a recovery, but most of the trends that we\u2019re seeing are pretty positive. The fact that we grew purchase volume per account up 18% is a really good indicator that consumers are spending again. And I do think that will turn into more revolving behavior over time. I mean, the effects of the stimulus as Brian said are going to \u2013 they\u2019re going to wane over time. I think you\u2019re going to start to see that pretty soon as the confidence gets better, you tend to see consumers take on more debt and revolve a little bit more, which will help on balances and margins as well. Brian Wenzel : The other thing I\u2019d add Brian, as you think about the new account originations, we haven\u2019t touched the credit box. I do think as we begin to continue to move through the year, we are making credit refinements to expand credit, but we haven\u2019t done that acquisition. So that will also provide a tailwind as we will throughout the year, Moshe. Brian Doubles : And then, Moshe, just on Venmo and Verizon, a lot to be excited about on both of those programs. Venmo is still early, but we\u2019re ahead of our expectation in terms of new accounts and spend, the feedback from customers on a card has just been phenomenal. They love the val prop and the fact that it automatically optimizes the rewards for the spending categories, where you\u2019re spending the most. They love the card design, the QR code. So the feedback has just been terrific. And then Verizon, which is a little bit further along, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re seeing really good purchase volume. It\u2019s definitely behaving like a top of wallet card, which is what we wanted. So, so far so good on both and I continue to believe that both can be top 10 programs for us in the future. Moshe Orenbuch : Thank you very much. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Moshe. Have a good day. Operator : We have our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the comments on loan growth, I guess, when I think about your framework and outlook for the year. Do you feel like you\u2019re more constructive on loan growth as we look out for the rest of the year? And then just specifically to that offline recovery, are you guys anticipating in offline recovery, because it would seem like it would impact that loan growth more significantly than others. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Good morning, Sanjay. Yes. As we think about loan growth here, we entered the quarter optimistic and the positioning. As we exited the quarter, we\u2019re probably a bit more optimistic than that. So we\u2019ve seen broad-based recovery, when you look at retail card up 11%, that is both the expansion of digital, as well as some of the, as you call them, offline retailers kind of coming into play. I think from receivable sampling, we are seeing strong volume, some of that is obviously buoyed by the stimulus dollars that came in in March. But we saw strength across each of the months and the quarter. So it outperformed what our expectations are. And as I think about loan growth, I think you probably will see an inflection point here in the second quarter and acceleration into the back part of the year. So I do think you\u2019ll see positivity come through the portfolio. And again, we have the tailwinds that are still existed in the CareCredit platform, right, as you have dental implant services opening up and you still have the supply chain issues in the Payment Solutions platform. So there\u2019s a lot of tailwinds that are in place besides what we\u2019ve already seen. So again, we\u2019re optimistic about where we are and how the second quarter will play out and what we\u2019ve seen to date in the quarter. And then how the back half of the year looks. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great. And just to follow-up, Brian Doubles, maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the GAAP relationship loss and sort of how you see it affecting the industry as a whole with newer players coming in and possibly doing some aggressive pricing type stuff. I mean, how do you think that affects the future pipeline. And are you seeing deals in your pipeline that look interesting? Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Look, I think this was a bit of a unique situation. I\u2019d say, we had a really good partnership for a number of years. We had great feedback actually from the client on our partnership model, our products, our capabilities. And I think at the end of the day, this one just came down to terms and price. And our competition was just a lot more aggressive on both. There were some \u2013 I would call them really out of market terms, where they were looking for guaranteed revenue that increased annually regardless of how the program performed. And for context, just given the turnaround that they\u2019ve been working through, the program had been shrinking. And so there\u2019s really only so far, you could go to guarantee those types of payments on a program like that. So, look, we tried to reach an agreement. At the end of the day, there just wasn\u2019t a way for us to get our interests aligned. But I do think this is a pretty unique situation. I look at the pipeline today across all three platforms. We\u2019ve got really attractive opportunities with very strong partners at attractive returns, where our interests are aligned. And I think that is so important. We talked about this for a number of years. We want programs where our interests are aligned in growing the program. We\u2019re doing that in a way that benefits both parties. So I still feel really good about the pipeline as I look across all three platforms. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Great. Thanks, Sanjay. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Brian Doubles : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So, Brian, you\u2019re running at 17.4% CET1, if I look at this quarter, you\u2019re earned over $1 billion. Reserves are likely coming down. And even with the return of growth, you\u2019re likely to accrete quarter \u2013 capital in the coming quarters, even using the existing $1.6 billion buyback. So I was wondering maybe could you just talk about the strategy for getting CET1 back towards peer levels? And is there the potential for you to revisit your capital return as for the coming quarters? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So, obviously, in the first quarter, we were purchased $200 million of shares in the quarter, that was part of the $1.6 billion we announced in the early part of January. And just to put that frame of reference, obviously, when we went to the board and discuss with the board, that authorization that was in the December timeframe off the models. As we move through the quarter, clearly, we have more information, we\u2019ve updated our scenarios, we submitted our capital plan to the Fed in March and look forward to their feedback later this quarter. So, obviously, we\u2019ll see what the results of that come back, but we\u2019re optimistic with regard to their support for our capital plan. It\u2019s not lost on us, so we have the excess capital Ryan, in the second quarter will again be subject to the limitations by the Fed, which will cap us out around $390 million for the current quarter with regard to the amount of repurchases that we can do. I would make the presumption will be depending upon market conditions at that maximum. And then we\u2019ll be back to you and talk about the capital plan that we submitted back to the Fed. That being said, to the extent that the income profile of the business changes, we have not in that capital plan, dealt anything with GAAP and if that portfolio conveys that we would potentially revisit that and go back to the Fed, if it\u2019s warranted. So we\u2019ll continue those discussions and dialogues with the board and most certainly with our regulators. So there is an opportunity. With regard to your cadence question, clearly, we want to get back to our long-term goal being in line with peers, and we\u2019ll do that as prudently as possible. But obviously, we want to do it with support of all our constituents. They\u2019re not barriers to doing it. We just want to do it in a prudent fashion. And most certainly, we\u2019re not totally done with the pandemic here, but we\u2019ll move as prudently as possible to execute that. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe just as a Saturday check to follow-up to Moshe\u2019s question. How should we think about the pacing of the NII improvement relative to the pacing of loan growth, given all the dynamics on margin and the normalization of credit over time? As we see these factors abating, should we see NII materially outpacing loan growth as we normalize? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. I would probably think the more moving in sequence, as of \u2013 in the early part of this quarter. As you get to the back part of the year, when you start seeing the late fee yield come in, you may see the NII accelerate a little bit faster, but it really depend upon that delinquency formation, right. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Ryan. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Ryan. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Wenzel : Good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions. Just on the capital targets, could you just give us a sense as to where you think optimized is for you over the next cycle here. And part of the reason for the question is, I\u2019m trying to understand how you\u2019re going to be thinking about your capital to fund loan growth. Or on the flip side, do you feel like your loan growth can be fully funded by the liquidity mixed shift. So just give some color there would be helpful. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Let start with the latter part of your question. Clearly, the excess liquidity we have, we believe sustains us with the loan growth that we see coming to the portfolio, which again, gets back to a more normalized level back half of the year, we\u2019ve talked about a potentially acceleration into 2022 as there\u2019s pent up demand. And we believe the excess liquidity is ample enough to support that. And most certainly, with the earnings power of the business that we expect this year from a capital standpoint, we should be able to support it. With regard to the first part of your question, with regard to those targets, I mean, we talk about peer targets, so you think about the cap ones discovers down and that 11 to 12, maybe 10.5 range. We\u2019ll see how the portfolio develops, where we\u2019re optimistic we can get there in a reasonable period of time. I think if you go back, we exited GE with 18%. We made it down to 14% before the pandemic hit. And we think we can get back in a fairly reasonable period of time. And if you remember right before the pandemic hit, we were on a path to execute a $3.6 billion capital plan, where $3.3 billion into it. So we think we can employ it fairly rapidly once we feel comfortable. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks, Brian. And then, Brian, you\u2019re talking at the beginning of the call about CareCredit. And maybe you could help us understand the impact of the Walgreens portfolio over time. I think you mentioned that you could see Verizon and Venmo getting a top 10 program, maybe you can give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about Walgreens. And then also how should we think about CareCredit impact on RSAs? Is it similar to the way that the retail program is run? Or is there any differences that we should be aware of? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Betsy. I think, look, CareCredit, I think is probably the most exciting growth opportunity that we\u2019ve got in the company today. And we tried to lay that out for you in a couple of slides. I think first, just going after a market of this size, that\u2019s growing as fast as it is. Obviously, healthcare costs are rising, high deductible plans are increasing in popularity. So less and less as being covered by insurance and that\u2019s really where CareCredit comes in. We\u2019re a big player in the space today, but financing options in this space is still a very small fraction of the potential spend that\u2019s out there. So there is just a ton of room for growth. And I think about the growth and really three components. One is growing the core. We\u2019re in CareCredit accepting about 250,000 locations today. We\u2019re in 40 different specialties. We just entered into 10 new specialties just over the last two years. And we\u2019re in 80% at dental offices, 85% of that. So we\u2019ve got a lot of scale. But with that said, there\u2019s still a lot of room to grow penetration inside of those providers because third-party financing options is still a relatively small percentage. So a lot of room for growth there. And then we talked a little bit about both health systems. We\u2019re in 13 large health systems today. That\u2019s a growing part of our business. We\u2019re paired up with big players like Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic, and then we talked about pets as really that third leg of the strategy. We\u2019re seeing just unbelievable growth in our pet insurance business that we bought a couple of years ago, up 174% since we bought it. So just a lot to be excited about. And then you touched on Walgreens. We had \u2013 our CareCredit cards were accepted at Walgreens. We expanded that relationship to launch a new program and I think similar to Venmo and Verizon, this can be a top 10 program for us. And we\u2019re tapping into 90 million my Walgreens customers. So the opportunity is just huge. And we\u2019re actively working to get that launched in the second half of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And the RSA \u2013 sorry\u2026 Brian Doubles : So, Betsy, the RSA will operate similar to how you see things operate in the retail card platform. So it would be a similar type of alignment for Walgreens. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And would you ever go after the opportunity with individual doctor practices for their personal needs? Or is this going to stay at the business level just wondering. Brian Doubles : Yes. No. In terms of financing the actual practice, Betsy? Betsy Graseck : Yes, exactly. Brian Doubles : Yes. Yes, that\u2019s an adjacency we\u2019ve looked at. In the past, it\u2019s on the screen, we don\u2019t have any immediate plans to go there, but definitely something to consider in the future. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Betsy. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And how are you. I guess, just going a little bit more \u2013 it\u2019s clear you did emphasize CareCredit in the prepared remarks. I\u2019m wondering, and you talked about the scale. Maybe can you give us an update I think from a competitive positioning perspective, you\u2019re dramatically larger than the next largest. I mean, maybe you talk about the competitive framework. And just given the growth momentum there, how much bigger as a percentage of, call it, loans or receivables might CareCredit be over the next few years? Brian Doubles : Yes, John. We\u2019re certainly probably the biggest player in this space that does what we do. But we have seen competition come and go into the space over time. I love the fact that we have the scale that we have. It\u2019s taken us decades to build this kind of scale and get embedded in 250,000 locations. So I would expect going forward to see outsized growth in CareCredit relative to the rest of the business. So I definitely think this becomes a bigger part of the business going forward. We\u2019re also increasing the level of investment that we\u2019re making in CareCredit. We\u2019ve invested quite a bit, obviously, over the last 10 years. But I\u2019d say just recently with acquisitions and pet insurance. We just recently acquired Allegro Credit. We\u2019re definitely seeing a lot of opportunities to invest both organically and inorganically, which I think will just accelerate the growth rate here relative to the rest of the business. John Hecht : Okay. And then you guys \u2013 you cited some good trends with respect to account adds recently. But clearly, there\u2019s been some churn as there always is in the portfolio. Is there any change in characteristics of where you\u2019re seeing some of the churn come from? Brian Wenzel : Yes, John, I don\u2019t think we see anything different. Clearly, the opening up of more traditional retail we see an influx there and a little bit through the door population, but there\u2019s no real fundamental shifts. John Hecht : Okay. Thank you guys very much. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Brian Doubles : Thank you, John. Have a good day. Operator : And we have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. Brian, obviously there has been a big proliferation of fintech companies. And I was just curious as you look at your three businesses, is there one or how would you rank them in terms of where you\u2019re watching closer? And I\u2019d be curious on CareCredit, it seems like that could be susceptible to fintech players maybe more so than other areas, but I could be wrong on that. Just wanted to get your thoughts. Brian Doubles : Yes. No, look, I think you can\u2019t limited to just one of the platforms. Obviously, it\u2019s a very competitive space right now. The fintech landscape is changing every minute and we have to stay all over it across all three of our businesses and I think the team is doing a really good job of doing that. So I don\u2019t think that we see of it more acutely in one area than another. I think what we tend to feel from fintech is they tend to do one thing really well and that\u2019s a luxury that they have and we are given our scale. We have to do a lot of things really well to compete with them. But I feel like we\u2019re doing that across all three of our platforms. So the competition is good. At the end of the day, it makes us better. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re losing share in any of our three platforms. We still got a lot of opportunity for growth. But it\u2019s something we got to stay all over. Our teams watch this. They\u2019re talking to our partners. And when they see people coming to the space, we\u2019re doing our best to keep amount and solidify our relationship. So I feel really good about our position competitively, but you can never let your guard down, you got to stay all over this. Don Fandetti : Yes. And then in terms of not really touching credit underwriting standards, it seems like some of the peers have started to loosen up are you just being cautious or do you still need to see something to get comfortable? Brian Doubles : No. So down the way, the way I think about it is, we have started to make refinements in our credit underwriting. If you remember when we started back in the pandemic, we did attaining more on proactive type of credit extension, so we shifted the cut-off down on our private label and dual card product mix. We were reduced a number of proactive credit line increases. We reduced the number of invitation to apply and pre-screen type offers on new accounts. As we move through into 2021, when we started to do in places where we actually have known customers, we begun to unwind a lot of those credit refinements. So we are shifting the cut-offs to more people to get a dual card, which would be a slightly higher line, but it most certainly stimulate some spend in the world. We have begun a number of credit line increase type programs, which are customers that we\u2019ve known and seen credit behavior and payment behavior patterns. And then we\u2019ve also begun to upgrade accounts from private label to dual card that would have qualified for dual card a year ago. So we\u2019re doing a number of things proactively. We just have not touched at the point of acquisition, changed any cut offs, things like that. But again, we didn\u2019t do a lot of that last year. So I don\u2019t really expect us to do a lot of it changes now, but we have begun proactive increases. And the good news is, given our portfolio, we\u2019re able to do that with customers we know and we\u2019re not taking incremental risk in our eyes. Don Fandetti : Got it. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Don. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Rick Shane : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Look, when we think about the nature of private label, there is more by category concentrated behavior than you would expect to see with, for example, general purpose. When you look forward to where there are opportunities for further recovery, how do you think the portfolio and the opportunity indexes against that? Brian Doubles : Yes, Rick. I think probably the best way to think about it is, you have to look at \u2013 I know there\u2019s obviously, T&E has a big pullback. We\u2019re a little bit less concentrated there, but certainly our dual cards will benefit from that and our general purpose card will benefit from that. I think the fact that brick and mortar stores are opening again. I think we\u2019re certainly well-positioned to benefit from that. And then I think frankly, the digital trends that we saw over the last year, while we\u2019re going to have some tough comps there coming up over the next few quarters. I feel like some of that shift was certainly permanent and will stay, and we\u2019ll benefit there as well. So look, if you look across the portfolio, the one thing that I think about quite a bit and we hear this from all of our partners, including all the providers in CareCredit is there is a real pent-up demand, right, for pretty much everything, this pent-up desire to spend and get back to normal. We\u2019re talking to our providers in CareCredit. And they can\u2019t keep up with the appointments, because so many people over the last year, they postpone things that weren\u2019t critical. They didn\u2019t want to go into the practices. And now you\u2019re seeing all of that start to flush through. So I think regardless of the category, there is a ton of pent-up desire to spend. And I think if travel and entertainment dining those things come back, I think that also spurs other types of spend that we will see both on our dual cards, but also in some of our adjacencies. Brian Wenzel : I think it\u2019s also, Brian, as you kind of pointed out, we\u2019re so broad based. When you think about inside retail card, which is up 11% in the first quarter, I mean think about the breadth of lifestyle/specialty groups are there. Think about the not only the American Eagle\u2019s, but the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods when you got to a value-oriented retailers, such as Sam\u2019s Club, et cetera, TJX, that are in there. We have such a wide breadth of coverage with regard to where spend happens. It actually is a fairly nice tailwind as we come out of this period. Rick Shane : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And Brian, you bring up a really interesting point in terms of CareCredit, and it leads to my follow-up question, which is, do you think that there are certain categories of spend that translate naturally into a higher percentage of borrow? Brian Doubles : The higher percentage of borrow, is that you said, Rick. Rick Shane : Yes. So for example, people may be more inclined not to borrow on a gas card, but certainly if it\u2019s a larger transaction like you might see through CareCredit there would be more revolve. Brian Doubles : Yes. Yes, I know, certainly, we would expect to see that in CareCredit with some of the bigger ticket purchases. We tend to see really good revolve rates there. And I do think it does depend a little bit on the size of the ticket. I mean if somebody is getting braces for their kids that\u2019s a big ticket item. They typically don\u2019t want to tie up their general purpose card utility with that purchase and that\u2019s where CareCredit comes in. And that can be done on a equal pay installment loan, it can be done on a promotional financing product, and we tend to see really good revolve rates there as well. Rick Shane : Great. Thank you guys very much. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Rick. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Rick. Have a good day. Operator : And we have our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to start, I was hoping you could share some color on how you\u2019re currently thinking about just buy now pay later. And I\u2019m thinking more in terms of the PAM4 type program versus some of the larger ticket things like payment solutions, where you basically have a buy now pay later solution. I\u2019m thinking more just the smaller ticket PAM for just how are you thinking about it, is that something you\u2019re considering, should we be expecting you to be in the market with something like that, any timeframes that you can share there? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I can tell you it\u2019s definitely be a product that we offer. We\u2019re going to have something to market with a couple of partners later this year. Just to take a step back more broadly, our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products. We have such a diverse array of partners that we really can have one size fits all strategy. We\u2019ve got to be able to offer revolving products, short-dated installment, longer-term installment, equal pay products, buy now pay later products, and we want to do that in a way that we can bring that full suite of products to our partners, and basically allow them to choose, which products are best for their customers based on, not only their customer, but what types of products are they selling. So not surprisingly bigger ticket items tend to steer more toward the longer-term installment, that can be on a revolving product or closed-end. And then smaller ticket, it tends to be shorter-term either through a product like SetPay or PAM4 type product. So that\u2019s really the strategy to provide that comprehensive suite of products and then take that to our partners and really allow them to select from that menu in terms of what meets their customer needs based on the products that they\u2019re selling in their strategy. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. And any timelines or anything, I guess on the ones that, I just wanted to clarify in terms of just your comments on loan balances, I just wanted to make sure I understood that right. Do you think loan balances have crossed are pretty close to trouping at this point? I guess what I\u2019m asking is, do you see more pressure from payment rates in 2Q or do you think that those balances start increasing from here? And if you\u2019ve seen anything in April that you be willing to share that will be great too. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Mihir. So I think, as you think about to be in prior to April, but we continue to see elevated payment rates from historical average that has tended to drill down a little bit. We expect that to burn off during this quarter. So with regard to a loan receivable trough, my expectation would be that we are going to trough here. Most certainly, we have seen very strong sales in the first 20 or so days of April. So our hope would be that we trough here in the second quarter and begin that acceleration up. Mihir Bhatia : Understood. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Have a good day. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Hi, yes, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Brian, I just had one follow-up on CareCredit. Most questions have been addressed. Can you just provide a little more, maybe granularity or specificity around just how the payment product is marketed, awareness is created for the transitional \u2013 transition to more kind of non-elective procedures. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019ve seen CareCredit displays at vets the countertops of vets and other elective outlets, but I\u2019m trying to understand how as a member myself of a large healthcare system, how I would even become aware of this is a payment option? How it\u2019s going to be marketed to me? Brian Doubles : Yes. A lot of it is, again, we\u2019ve built this business over decades and a lot of it is awareness at the point of sale. So when you\u2019re sitting in the waiting room for \u2013 of that appointment or dental appointment, you see the promotional financing offers, you see CareCredit. We actually talk about it in the providers and talk about the benefits of it. And so that\u2019s the primary channel and at least has been historically. We also have a provider locator. And what we\u2019re trying to do is move up funnel a bit, so that at the time that you\u2019re booking your appointment, so a lot of that is now happening online, you\u2019re actually getting \u2013 you\u2019re seeing the promotional financing offer. So that that becomes counter part of how you\u2019re thinking about your treatment. So it\u2019s not \u2013 once you actually get your appointment, they become aware of it, you can actually go through the whole process well in advance of your appointment and think about how you\u2019re going to pay for whether it\u2019s braces or whatever your treatment is going to be. And we found that to be really successful. So we\u2019ve been building that brand awareness over time. It originated largely inside of a provider\u2019s office, but has certainly expanded to be more digital in nature if through direct marketing and other channels. David Scharf : Yes. I see, and I believe you may have mentioned MyChart at one point, I mean, once again, just reflecting on particularly over the pandemic the \u2013 what expenses over the last few years, yes. Brian Doubles : Yes. Getting integrated into the practice management software system is huge for us. That is a really important aspect of the growth strategy here. And for health systems, our integration with Epic inside of the dentists and the vats their practice management software, regardless of what they use we want to be completely integrated there so that it becomes part of the process for the office manager that\u2019s working there. And you can imagine we \u2013 with 250,000 providers, we have a wide range of big providers, small providers, and keeping CareCredit top of mind as a payment option is really critical to the future growth of that business. David Scharf : Got it. And just one last follow-up more program-specific on Venmo I know you had mentioned it. It\u2019s still very early stages and I think you had commented it\u2019s I\u2019m honesty kind of exceeding kind of expectations at this time. Can you give us a little color though on perhaps what percentage of the Venmo user base has initially been targeted? Just trying to get, it\u2019s obviously a very younger-skewing demographic. I got to believe a lot of Venmo users have very thin credit files, just trying to get a sense for how we should think about the opportunity there in terms of the mix of current users. Brian Doubles : Yes. I mean, nothing I can provide specifically, but I mean this is a huge opportunity to tap into 70 million Venmo customers. I mean obviously, they have to meet our underwriting criteria and our screen, but that\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. Again, no doubt, this is going to be a top 10 program and the early returns in terms of what we\u2019re seeing on spend and accounts is ahead of what we thought it would be. And we had \u2013 we\u2019re pretty aspirational in terms of our expectations. So very positive even though it\u2019s only done in full launch mode for a couple of months. Brian Wenzel : The only other thing I\u2019d add here, this is another point of the strength that we have, Brian, right, which is the ability to get data from our providers. So when you think about where Venmo may know a customer for a period of time, watched the payment velocity, CLO may be affiliated. They can passes that information. So it actually helps us even though they may have a same credit bureau, the richness of the data they have with PayPal and Venmo maybe a help for us as we underwrite. David Scharf : Got it. Thank you very much. Brian Doubles : Have a good day. Jennifer Church : Thanks, David. Vanessa, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. If you think about \u2013 I just want to go back to the total business and I really appreciate all the color on CareCredit. But if we think about the CET1 and where that can go versus the general purpose players. I think historically, there has been a buffer between private label and general purpose CET1s. And so do you expect that spread to close? And is \u2013 have you had conversations with the regulators of them feeling comfortable with that closure? And then I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Dominic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a conversation with regard to the product private label versus general purpose. I think they look at the loss scenarios that we\u2019ve run, right, the stress scenarios that we\u2019ve run. We all have a very unique feature in the RSAs, which provide a buffer against some of the outlays. So I think when you look at the output of those, we don\u2019t really view it differently than some of our competitors. When you think about a capital one for even take with regard to how their stress capital buffer comes out. So we are in line with those. It\u2019s not really product-oriented. And most certainly for us as we have those conversations really demonstrating to them the resiliency of this business and this customer because of the point of origination. We actually get stronger yields and risk adjusted returns of. And again when you combine that with the RSA buffer, it provides particular strength when it comes to having a lower capital ratio and those are the conversations we\u2019re having with them. Dominick Gabriele : Makes a lot of sense. I would argue, you should be below the general purpose players to some extent because of all those factors on a risk adjusted basis. And then if you think about the efficiency of the business as we move forward, there\u2019s obviously going to be some pressure from multiple factors on the loan book. And obviously, you could see some good cycle growth given the some of the tailwinds of the overall economy. But when we think of GAAP, when we think about all the various factors of just the size of your loan book, how do you think about the long-term efficiency of the business moving forward over the next few years? Is there some pressure on efficiency and so you get back to maybe your more traditional average loan book size? And is there is some dynamics between the credit \u2013 CareCredit and the retail card there? Thanks so much. I really appreciate being on the call. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Dominic. So I think the way to think about efficiency is when we went through last year, we underwent a strategic outlook. That said, if I look out to 2025 think about the mix of business I\u2019m going to have, think about trying to be a top ROA profile company and I look at the revenue characteristics, the loss content characteristics, the RSA characteristics, what is my expense and efficiency ratio have to be in order to be a top tier ROA ahead of all of our peers to really generate the investment thesis. We then roll that back into the plans that we put in place in the latter part of 2020. So I think we\u2019ve engaged upon that. Part of that\u2019s delivering over $210 million of benefit this year from a cost out perspective. I think the greater pressure on the efficiency ratio in the short-term to be honest with you is the revenue headwind that we have with the net interest margin and NII been a little bit impact, that are being impacted by stimulus and it really terrific credit and late fee impact that comes from that. That\u2019s a little bit ahead, but I do think you\u2019re going to see this. This business model, right, we\u2019re built off the foundation of running expenses at a very manageable level given the loan balance side. I think as you see CareCredit\u2019s other business grow, you should be able to get operating leverage, because they run at higher average balances. If you think about the bigger ticket size associated with those accounts. And then what can be loss is the fact that we don\u2019t have to spend as much on marketing as our peers relative to generate those new accounts. So we are an industry probably best or very attractive cost to acquire customers, which really puts us at a competitive advantage versus our peers. So we will tightly manage the efficiency. And while we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the future. The digital assets that we put in play over the last several years, we\u2019re going to continue to invest for our long-term future. So it\u2019s a combination of investing and really having a business model and set of partners where we can leverage it and generate that operating efficiencies. We probably grow above average with peers and have a higher return than average versus our peers that\u2019s how I would think about it, Dominic. Dominick Gabriele : All right, great. Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. Brian Doubles : Great. Have a good day, Dominic. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. Our call is now concluded.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is been recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you and good morning, everyone.

Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Wenzel Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks Kathryn and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered strong results during the second quarter reflecting the power of our technology enabled model, the durability of our partner-centered value proposition and the early indications of a consumer resurgence. With now more than a year of the COVID 19 pandemic moving into the rearview mirror I am proud of how our team has continued to execute on our strategic priorities. Our multiproduct, multi capability strategy has enabled us to nimbly adapt and deliver best-in-class products and services to address our partner\u2019s evolving needs while also generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns for all our stakeholders. Let's get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter, net earnings reached a record $1.2 billion or $2.12 per diluted share. This reflected an increase of $2.06 over last year, as we mark the anniversary of the pandemic's initial impact on our business and really the world. We are deeply grateful for all of the frontline workers, scientists and leaders have done to support our community and make progress toward eventual return to normalcy. Purchase volume grew 35% over last year reflecting a 33% increase in purchase volume per account. This increase spend was broad-based across our five business platforms. This strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a slight increase in the loan receivables which were $78.4 billion for the second quarter. Average balances per account were down about 4% for the period while new accounts were up 58%, net interest margin of 13.78% was 25 basis points higher than last year. Elevated payment rates in excess liquidity levels continued to have an impact on receivables and yield. The efficiency ratio was 39.6% for the quarter, primarily reflecting lower net interest income expenses were down about 4% compared to last year and down 5% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned. We remain on track to remove about $210 million from our expense base by year end even as we continue to invest in our business. Credit continued to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 3.57% for the second quarter down almost 178 basis points from last year. Turning to our balance sheet deposits were down $4 billion or 7% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity position. Deposits represented 81% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of some of our debt during the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter we returned $521 million in capital, through share repurchases of $393 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. We also continue to reinvest in our business, one of our greatest competitive differentiators remains our digital capabilities. We continue to invest in innovative products and services that enable our partners to meet their customers wherever and however they want to be met. That where and how of course can change fairly quickly. As can the objectives that our partners seek to achieve so we need to stay nimble and ahead of the curve. We have continued to win and renew key partnerships. Including our recent renewal with TJX Company. This has been a very valuable partnership for over 10 years now and we're excited to continue to provide innovative financing products to TJX customers. We also renewed 10 other programs during the quarter including Shop HQ, Daniels and Sutherlands and added four new programs including JCB and Ochsner Health. Our go-to-market strategy utilizes innovative and scalable ways to reach and serve customers effectively across a broad spectrum of industries and financing needs in over the course of their lifecycle. We have built a technology platform that harnesses our proprietary data analytics, cutting-edge digital capabilities to offer a customized suite of products specifically designed with our partners and their customers in mind, although delivering appropriately aligned economic outcomes. Our recent a business reorganization which included the creation of a growth organization and the redistribution of our partners from three sales platforms into five, will allow us to better leverage these company resources and deliver swifter, more optimized products and capabilities for our partners and sustainable profitable growth for our business. In fact the growth we expect to achieve within each platform will be driven by utilizing our suite of products to expand lifetime value, deploying more of our digital capabilities to expand customer reach by adapting our value propositions to harness organic trends as the landscape evolves. In the case of our home and auto platform a combination of all three. In particular our home partnerships have been a focus of Synchrony's going back to our business inception when we started providing financing for appliance purchases. Over the years we\u2019ve significantly broadened the scope of this platform and expanded our customer reach. Today Synchrony has penetrated across all distribution points in each sector of the home market. From big retailers to independent merchants and contractors and OEMs and dealers our home platform provides financing solutions to about 60,000 merchants and locations across the broad spectrum of industries. Including furniture and accessories, mattresses and bedding, appliances, windows, roofing HVAC and flooring. Our partnerships are deeply rooted in industry expertise, data-driven strategic objectives and mutually beneficial economic outcomes. The average length of our top 20 partners is over 30 years because we are able to deliver a breadth of financing products, innovative digital capabilities and seamless customer experiences that are customized to each partner\u2019s needs as they evolve over time. Our data insights and analytics expertise when combined with the partners own data empowers each merchant as they seek to optimize their marketing, customer acquisition and sales strategies.  And the value that our suite of products provides to their customers is clear. About 58% of our sales are repeat purchases. With our customers are looking to upgrade their living room couch or suddenly find themselves in need of a new washing machine. We enable our partners to consistently support those needs through a variety of financing options that are best suited to the customer and the particular purchase they're considering. So whether we\u2019ve been entrusted to enhance customer loyalty, drive transaction volume or assure our retailers adoption of digital assets. Our strategy has enabled steady growth across the home market. For the four years prior to the pandemic Synchrony\u2019s home receivables grew at a 7% CAGR as consumer spent within home improvement, furniture and decor and electronic and appliances sectors each grew by between 4% and 8% annually. Certainly the pandemic has brought with it both challenges and opportunities. As consumers quarantined in their homes the desire to renovate their homes or upgrade their furniture and d\u00e9cor intensified. As people start to leave crowded metropolitan communities for suburban neighborhoods, home improvement spent increased. In 2020 alone the home industry represented an approximate $600 billion market opportunity. Synchrony serves a fraction of that today. Even as we normalize toward a pre-pandemic cadence, the consumers desire to invest in their living spaces Is as strong as ever perhaps reflecting a secular shift in favor of more remote work. We have positioned our home platform very well to capitalize on these trends. We have opportunities to deepen the scope and reach of existing partnerships while also implementing a number of strategic initiatives to better leverage our core competencies and deepen our market penetration, for example, we have begun using more data and advance analytics to enhance our acquisition marketing and drive higher repeat sales. We've also launched our direct to device capability which puts the simplicity of our financing application and the power of our underwriting in the hands of the contractors and customers as they seek to install a new HVAC system, replace their windows or repair an oven. This direct-to-device technology is also being deployed in retailer locations which helps shorten checkout lines and delivers a completely digital solution to apply and buy when in-store. In short, we are excited about the opportunities for growth that we see in our home platform there is certainly some natural tailwinds in the industry that should feel home spend even if life normalizes in the post pandemic world. We are actually more excited about the ways in which we're leveraging our technological innovations to extend our customer reach, enhance the value of the products and services we offer and deepen our competitive differentiation. As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy, we are driving even greater customer lifetime value for our partners, better experiences for their customers and strong returns for our stakeholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Brian and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier the strong results we achieved during the second quarter reflected a number of factors. First healthy consumer with significant savings and pent-up demand for spending leading to broad-based purchase volume growth. Second continued strengthening credit quality across our portfolio. We continue to closely monitor our portfolio as industrywide forbearance begins to expire across the broader consumer finance landscape and for some customers as rental forbearance also expires. Finally the strong positioning of our business, combined with consistent execution by our team while we maintain focus on efficient delivery of customized financing solutions and digitally enable customer experiences across our diverse portfolio partners, merchants and providers. Focusing on the healthy consumer who has robust savings and desire to spend in an environment with improving economic trends. During the second quarter consumer savings rates remained strong unemployment continued to improve and consumer competence reached a 16-month high.  As a result discretionary spend seems to be making gradual return to pre-pandemic levels, in fact a conference board survey from June indicated that there is also healthy interest amongst consumers to spend on long-lasting manufacturing goods over the next six months. Including homes, cars and major household appliances which we expect to be a positive tailwind for our home and auto platform in particular. Across our diverse set of platforms strong consumer spend trends contributed to 35% higher purchase volume compared to last year, primarily reflecting 33% stronger purchase volume per account.  When comparing these trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter 2019 and excluding the impact of Walmart, purchase volume was 18% higher in second quarter 2021 and purchase volume per account was 22% higher. This demonstrates strong consumer demand translating the higher spend relative to pre-pandemic levels. Dual and co branded cards accounted for 39% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and increased 56% from last year. On a loan receivables basis they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and were flat to the prior year. Average active accounts rep about 2% compared to last year and new accounts were 58% higher totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the second quarter. And over 11 million new accounts year-to-date. Loan receivables reached $78.4 billion in the second quarter a slight increase year-over-year as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by persistently elevated payment rate.  This marks the first quarter of the year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. Payment rate was almost 300 basis points higher when compared to last year which primarily led to a 6% reduction in interest and fees on loans. ROCs increased $233 million or 30% from last year and were 5.25% of average receivables. The increase relative to last year's second quarter was primarily reflected in significant improvement in net charge-offs. As a reminder our retailers share raise are designed to share in programs performance portfolios are performing better on a risk-adjusted basis our partner share in this performance. So the RSAs performing as it is designed and the elevated levels we've seen over last three quarters are reflection of Synchrony\u2019s particular financial strength through the pandemic. We continue to expect RSAs to decline as net charge-offs begin to rise. With an improved credit performance and a more optimistic macroeconomic environment we reduced our loan loss reserves by $878 million this quarter. Other income decreased $6 million generally reflecting higher loyalty program cost from higher purchase volume during the quarter. Other expenses decreased $38 million due to lower operational losses partially offset by an increase in employee, marketing and business development and information processing cost. Moving to slide 8 and our platform results. We saw a broad based purchase volume growth across all five platforms as consumers have become increasingly confident and remaining local restrictions are being lifted. Both our health and wellness and diversified value platforms experienced more than 50% growth in purchase volume. In health and wellness, this primarily reflected lifting of local restriction on in person interactions and consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing elective procedures. The lifting of state restrictions was also a primary driver of the significant purchase volume growth in our diversified value platform as consumers increased their discretionary [ph] spend in categories like clothing and assorted household goods. Meanwhile purchase volume grew by 30% in our digital platform, 25% in home and auto and 9% in lifestyle. Loans receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected stabilization or modest growth versus the prior year as the higher purchase volume was partially offset by the elevated payment rates, the one exception being our diversified value platform which was also impacted by store closures in 2020. Average active accounts trends were mixed on a platform basis up by as a much as 5% in digital and down by as much as 6% in health and wellness. The active account growth in digital generally reflected the combination of a shift in the timing of an annual promotional events and the ramp up of some of our recent partner launches. The active account decline in health and wellness was primarily associated with the continued strength in consumer back balance sheets. Interest and fees were generally down across the platforms with the exception of lifestyle due to lower yield as a result of elevated payment trends we've been discussing. I'll move to slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, the continued combined impacts of the mark stimulus and high savings balance built during the pandemic led to higher than the average payment rate across our portfolio. As slides 9 nine shows, payment rate ran approximately 280 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average and about 300 basis points higher relative to last year\u2019s second quarter. It\u2019s worth noting the gradual moderation in payment rate from April to June at which point the payment rate was 18.5% and 90 basis points decrease for the March monthly peak of 19.4%. We expect continued gradual moderation in payment rate as consumers continue to spend the excess savings they accumulated resulting from the combined impact of stimulus and slower discretionary spend during the lockdown. Interest and fees were down about 6% in the second quarter reflecting lower financed charge [ph] yield from elevated payment rate trends and continued lower delinquent accounts resulting from our strong credit performance. Net interest income decreased 2% from last year. The net interest margin was 13.78% compared to last year's margin of 13.53%, a 25 basis points year over year improvement driven by favorable interest-bearing liabilities cost and mix of interest earning assets partially offset by the pandemic's impact on the loan receivable yield. More specifically, the interest bearing liabilities cost were 1.42% a year over year improvement of 73 basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided 62-basis-point increase in our net interest margin. The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 170 basis points from 78% to 79.7% driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter. this accounted for a 32 basis point increase in the margin. The loan receivables yield was 18.62% during the second quarter, the 84 basis points year over year reduction reflected the impact of highest payment rate and lower interest and fees which we discussed earlier and impacted our net interest margin by 65 basis points. We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, liquidity will continue to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payment rates should result in a higher interest and fee yields leading to increasing net interest margin. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 10. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with delinquency trends. Our 30 plus delinquency rate was 2.11% compared to 3.13% last year. Our 90 plus delinquency rate was 1% compared to 1.77% last year. Higher payment trends continue to drive delinquency improvements. Focusing on the net charge off rate trends, our net charge off rates was 3.57% compared to 5.35% last year. Our reduction in net charge off rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trends as customer behavior pattern improved over the last several quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loan receivables was 11.51%. As far as our credit outlook is concerned, we're monitoring trends in our portfolio closely as the accounts enrolls a multiple forbearance programs roll off but have not seen any indication in the portfolio to date. Our best expectation at this time is that delinquencies should begin to rise sometime in the back half of 2021 being the peak delinquencies in mid-2022. This would translate a net charge off peak in late 2022. Moving to slide 11, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were down $38 million or 4% from last year to $948 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce cost and remain disciplined in managing our expense pace. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses, partially offset by the increased employee, marketing and business development and information processing costs. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 39.6% compared to 36.3% last year. The main drivers of the increase of the efficiency ratio was a negative impact from lower revenue that resulted from a combination of lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield. This is partially offset by a reduction in expenses. Moving to slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021 and the strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our mix of funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined $4.3 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.6 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized funding comprising 10% and unsecured funding comprising 9% of our funding sources at the quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities was $21.2 billion which equated to 23% of our total assets down from 29% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which had two primary benefits. First it delays the effect of CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortize with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 250 basis points above the last year's level of 15.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.7% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.3% last year. The total capital ratio increased 250 basis points to 20.1% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased in basis was 28% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting the impact of the retained net income. During the quarter, we returned $521 million to shareholders which included $393 million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. During the quarter, we also announced the approval of a $2.9 billion share repurchase programs through June 2022 as well as our plan to maintain a regularly quarterly dividend. Our business generates a considerable amount of capital, thanks to the scalability of our digital capabilities, utility of our diversified product suite, and the prioritization of growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. We will continue to take an opportunistic approach to returning capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions. As we exit the pandemic and the environment normalizes, we're confident in our capabilities and positioning of our business. We are emerging from this period as a stronger and more dynamic company and we are excited about the opportunities we see to drive strong financial results and shareholder value. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks Brian. While the pandemic has presented our company in the world with never been before seen challenges. Synchrony has continued to arise to the occasion facilitating the evolution of many of our partners as the new operating environment has been ushered in. We have a truly unique understanding of the partners we serve and the customer needs they seek to address. We have an almost 90 year history in consumer financing. We have continued to invest in our comprehensive product suite, amass our propriety data, and leverage our advanced analytics to achieve targeted outcomes for each of the merchants we work with. We have been consistently investing in digital innovation for years and have demonstrated how effectively we can adapt to deliver the value of our partners have come to expect while also driving strong financial results and attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary and one follow up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW, please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. So Brian Doubles, you mentioned an early indication of consumer resurgence, I'm just curious which macro data points and micro ones give you the most encouragement and then I guess, the question I'm getting quite a bit is what the setup is for loan growth with us moving away from stimulus and there being other benefits coming from the government like the tax credits and obviously infrastructure, maybe you could just help us think through all of that. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah hey Sanjay. So look, I think no matter where you look, we feel pretty bullish around what we're seeing in the economy. Consumer confidence continues to build the trends on retail sales and spending, all of that is translating into really good spend on our cards, so as we look across our five platforms, it really is broad based. 35% purchase volume growth year over year, really strong across all five platforms. The fact we're up 18% versus 2019, I think is a really good indications. So it\u2019s not just that we\u2019re complaining against the weak 2020, it really is broad based growth across the company. And then as you look at kind of per account purchase volume, per account was up 33%, so that\u2019s another positive indicator. And then, this is a little more anecdotal but as we talked to our partners, no matter what segment we\u2019re in, they\u2019re seeing a lot of pent up demand to spend. The providers in CareCredit, they\u2019re booking appointments now, 3, 4 months out, they\u2019re opening the practices on Saturdays and Sundays to keep up with the volume. So, I know that's a little more anecdotal but as our teams are out every day talking to the partners, they\u2019re in the stores, there's just seeing and feeling a lot of pent up demand to spend. And I don't know Brain, if you want to add to that a little bit on. Brian Wenzel : Yeah, the only thing I would add Sanjay to that is as we look at savings rates, you clearly see the consumer who increased their savings in the beginning part of the pandemic when stimulus happened. That came back down in line with historical averages towards the end of 2020, Egan saw that lift here in the end of the first quarter, into second quarter with the stimulus actions. We begin, we see now across between our largest banks that began to crowd down a little bit. So, some of those will come back in line clearly with the spending, behavior pattern as well as the increase in the financial obligations as mortgage forbearance, auto forbearances and the enhance on employment benefits began to fade here in the back half of the year. Brian Doubles : Yeah, I think Sanjay, you touched on receivables growth, that will absolutely come, we had four out of our five platforms had receivables growth. The payment rate is a little bit tough to predict, but we don't see anything that is permanent inside of the portfolio. So I do think we will see a reversion to the mean around payment rate. And based on the spend that we're seeing on our cards, receivables growth will absolutely come and we're starting to see some positive signs there in, like I said 4 out of our 5 platforms this quarter. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. That's a perfect, and just a follow up, there's a couple of portfolios that have been out there, mentioned to be far I\u2019m just curious how you are seeing your pipeline develop in terms of deal, your portfolio acquisition except from maybe you just touched on that and just one want clarification Brian Wenzel, the framework for key drivers from last quarter I mean it sounds like most of them stand but I just wanted to clarify that they still stand? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah, so let me start on the pipeline question Sanjay. So I would say across all five platforms we've got a good pipeline of new opportunities. One of the benefits of the reorganization is our teams are getting even deeper and aligned by industry. And we've got some fresh set of eyes on certain things and we're looking at opportunities for new programs and start ups that are a little bit unconventional, a little bit creative and I think that's a great sign and kind of part of what we are trying to achieve with the reorg. I would tell you most of the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in the pipeline are startups or new programs with a couple exceptions of things that are out there that we\u2019re looking at that they have existing portfolios but again strong pipeline across all five platforms. Brian Wenzel : Yes Sanjay to your framework question so the lack of the page I wouldn't confuse with the fact that we\u2019re changing that framework again. I think when you look at what we've put out in the first quarter. We highlighted the continued high payment rates that will impact loan growth in the first half of the year, that's going to continue. We do think it begins to abate in the back half of the year. So I think when the purchase volume and receivable growth standpoint it's the same clearly the elevated payment rate and persistency of that will provide a little bit of headwind and manages margin as we move into the back half of the year. From a credit perspective you know the higher payment rate really is given us what I\u2019ll say almost pristine type credit so I think you\u2019ll see in the back half of the year. Really for the full year for the company we\u2019re going to be some 4% on a lost rate perspective which is remarkable for this business given high margins. And then the RSA following those trends will be a little bit more elevated in the back half of the year. Which again is working as it's designed to share the upside performance of the company, so that's how I think about it\u2019s largely consistent with what we\u2019ve said back in the first quarter so. Operator : Thank you our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Good new customer activity, maybe can you tell us how much of that was say from the New York channels like Venmo and Verizon. Maybe just give us kind of an update on call it the maturation of those two new programs? Brian Doubles : Yeah John so we obviously can\u2019t break out any specific performance on the programs, but I can just talk generally about both Venmo is going really well. We're in full launch mode, the I would say performance is better than our expectations so far. We are getting really great feedback from the customers around just the profit and the fact that we maximize rewards in those spend categories. They love the card design, they love the QR code, the ability to split payments and share and so that program\u2019s off to a great start it's still early but all of the key indicators that we look at are performing really well and similarly on Verizon this is another program for us that will be a 10 program in the future. Performing ahead of our expectations and a great feedback on the [indiscernible] prop it's definitely behaving like a top of our card which is what we intended. That was the goal and so we\u2019re seeing really good spend on Verizon products and even - and outside as well. So off to a great start on both and like I said I think these can both be top 10 programs for us in the future. John Hecht : Okay, very good thanks and then Brian, maybe you could give us a high-level kind of quick discussion at - the state of the market and really what I'm kind of interested in is you've got some new kind of emerging market purchase spends in the buy now pay later product and so forth. And so I'm kind of wondering what your senses for kind of underwriting quality across the spectrum and kind of competitive factors across the spectrum given the changing elements of the market? Brian Doubles : Yeah John, it's a great question I think. Obviously there are always new entrants in the buy now pay later space, I think it\u2019s pretty clear at this point that every financial service provider out there will offer a buy now pay later product equal pay financing is a big part of our business already, we highlighted we do over $15 billion of balances currently on equal pay products we offer those products over 70,000 locations. So our goal at the end of the day is to have a multi product multi-capability solution. I think ultimately that's what's going to win. And that's what we're offering to our providers in terms of the competitive dynamics, it's hard to tell how others are underwriting. What I can tell you is we\u2019ve been in this business a long time, it is really important to stay disciplined which means you don't go a lot deeper in really good times and you try not to contract too much in bad times. Because we know that our partners really value that stability, the consistency of our underwriting.  And they get used to a certain approval rate. And we try to protect that in both the good times and bad times. And as we all know if you\u2019ve been in this business a long time if you do take on substantially more risk and you\u2019re winning business by lowering your underwriting standards that\u2019s a losing strategy over the long-term. And so, that's not how we operate we\u2019ve got a very experienced, disciplined credit team. And look we want to win business based on our products and capabilities, based on our technology, our partnership model we never want to win business based on just going deeper and taking on more risk. Operator : And we have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Yes, Brian can you talk a little bit about the child tax credit digging a little bit more for example, do you think that will lead to higher payment rates in July versus June. And how do you think about the raw overall materiality of it versus prior stimulus? Brian Doubles : Yeah thanks Don. Obviously an influx of $15 billion of cash on top of what is really out there is clearly not going to be beneficial. That being said been targeted to folks unless $150,000 that's a pull forward really from 2022. I'm not necessarily sure it will have a material impact necessarily on our payment rates as we look in the beginning a part of July. We have not seen a real elevation of payment rates are more consistent with what we saw as we exited out of June. So I don't really see any data yet that says that that\u2019s going to be a potential problem more certainly we\u2019ll watch and see whether or not that becomes a permanent credit and a permanent pull forward as legislature gets inactive later on this year so we\u2019ll continue to watch it, Don. Don Fandetti : Okay, thank you I\u2019m all set. Brian Doubles : Thanks Don, have a good day. Operator : And we have our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi couple of questions just the first one you talked through the NIM and the loan growth how it\u2019s being impacted by the payment rates et cetera but could you speak to how much the loan growth and potentially NIM is impacted by some of these new entrants that we\u2019ve been seeing and discussing here be it either BMPL or other kinds of payment schemes that enable people to really shift some of their spending away from what might have been their primary payment device. I'm just wondering if that's had any impact? Brian Doubles : Yeah Betsy I\u2019ll let Brian chime in here but what we're seeing is really attributed to the higher payment rate just because consumers balance sheets are stronger than they have ever been and I think that is the primary driver I don\u2019t think this is competitive - competitive pressure in any way but I\u2019ll let Brian add some color to that. A - : Yes, I\u2019ll just point back to a couple of things Betsy. First when you look at our new account origination just 6.3 million new accounts, up 1% versus 2019, so we\u2019re not seeing and even when we look down at the providers that may have alternative type of products at least buy now pay later products. We're not seeing a real impact relative to new accounts. We also don't really see it in the payment rate where we\u2019re kind of coming through it really is as Brian pointed out the accumulated savings rates that you see in a stimulus that has flowed through the consumer that's really driving the pressure against purchase volume and headwind which is producing tremendous credit which we sometimes put in the back mirror but the credit is really terrific right now. So we will continue to monitor it but we don't see an impact from the alternate players. Betsy Graseck : Great ok now I get it and clearly credit is a part of the mass here so it\u2019s a little bit surprising when people only look at like a [indiscernible] instead of including the credit I agree I guess the other question I have on this is, with regard to deposit products that you might be planning or thinking of offering because when you think about the BNPL the pay-in for the pure pay in for. I know there is different BNPL but the pure pay in for should be finance stirred or funded with a checking account right. I mean you shouldn\u2019t be paying for your pay in for with a card balance, but I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that when you're developing your own products. And whether or not we should be anticipating more in the way of deposit products coming out from you? thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah, no, I mean Betsy's it\u2019s a great question. And we agree you shouldn\u2019t pay up one credit product with another credit product so, we agree with that. I think we're looking at some alternative kind of savings products as part of our broader product strategy. Buy now pay later is obviously top of mind right now across all issuers. Like I said I think everybody will have a version of it. We have 15 billion balances today as I said and we\u2019re rolling out some new capabilities and features in the second half of the year. So nothing I can get too specific at this at this point but I would want to comment definitely part of our multiproduct strategy I touched on earlier. Operator Thank you our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey everybody, thanks for taking my question this morning. Brian you did a great job highlighting the impact of home and auto on the portfolio, I'm curious with the changes in the composition over the last several years. How important do you think back-to-school is particularly in light of the challenges for back-to-school spending last year? Brian Doubles : Yeah, back-to-school hasn\u2019t been a big driver for us for a number of years Rick which is kind of surprising you know we just we don't see a ton of volume there and I think it's not as much of an event as it was probably when you and I were growing up, it was more then I know even for my girls they don\u2019t there isn't a back-to-school event where they all go get new clothes and stuff for school. So we tend to see that spend space out over a longer period of time and it\u2019s less of a spike for us so. I think that trend will continue even in the new paradigm. Rick Shane : Got it, I appreciate that and Kathryn because you know me well enough that my clothing budget is not that great either even when I was a kid. Operator : And we have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Brian I'm hoping that you could talk a little bit about the kinds of conversations that you have with your large retail partners about BNPL in other words I have to believe that they are quite invested in the success of your programs given they earn a significant amount of money whereas on BNPL they\u2019re kind of paying a significant amount of money and so kind of maybe could you just obviously not asking about any specific partner but what are those conversations like? Brian Doubles : Yeah so it's a great question Moshe. I think a lot of our partners are still in kind of the evaluation phase where they look at the buy now pay later products and they obviously see a customer desire for that product right, and a customer demand for it but one of the big questions is as you pointed out it\u2019s around economics. And it's still early there and I think some retailers are willing to pay what is a pretty steep merchant discount rate, if they believe that they are attracting new customers and they're getting sales that they wouldn't otherwise get, but when they look at that comparison they look at compared to some of our - some of our products where not only do we not charge interchange. We are also paying them quite a bit through the RSA and they look at that and they say, okay. Clearly, economically they would prefer that the purchase goes on the private label card or a co-brand card because it's much better for them financially. And so to the extent that they stop believing that they\u2019re actually getting incremental purchases or new customers than the economic trial is very clear and so, I do think down the road there\u2019s an economic reckoning that will happen as this plays out and it's still early in terms of these products and how they\u2019re offered. The other thing I would mention is that the other advantage and the things that we hear from our partners is they like the lifetime relationship that a card provides, they can do lifecycle marketing, they can do promotions and offers over number of years. And one of the things that we talk a lot about with our partners is I think we measure across all of our partners is repeat purchases and we talked to you guys a lot about that as well because that has been a big focus for us over the last five years and one of the things that frankly our partners look to us for is that ongoing customer loyalty. We measure that, we look at by customer, when was the last time they made a purchase, okay, let\u2019s send them a customized offer or promotion. So, they like that ability to do that lifecycle marketing. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of economics and that\u2019s still kind of TVD [ph] and how this is going to shake out. But the other thing that we hear across the board is they want to have a long term relationship with the customer. They really value the loyalty that a lot of our products provide. Moshe Orenbuch : Thank you. And my follow up question is for Brian Wenzel, you kind of highlighted the impact of I believe these along with the payment rate, could you just talk a little bit about how that comes back like what is the timeframe, is it kind of the early stage delinquencies? How should we think that\u2026 normalization of that factor? Brian Doubles : Yeah, great question Moshe, I think the way we\u2019ve kind of think about credit outlook now, delinquencies built towards latter part of this year, adding into 2022. So late fees will begin to come back as you see the entry rate delinquency begin to rise. So, that will come first before you get into the charge off. So if you believe that, the latter part of this year, you'll begin to see the yield impact benefit coming from higher late fees in the portfolio. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Devries with Barclays. Mark Devries : Yeah, thanks. I had the question about the NIM, can you help us think about the lift that you made yet from both the normalization of the payment rate to kind of the long-term historic average and also over the normalization of liquidity as a percentage of assets? Brian Doubles : Yeah, so the way I was thinking about let's take liquidity first, and the portfolio, so clearly we've been able to burn off sum of that liquidity here in the second quarter both through the $2 billion in asset growth that we've had as well as acceleration of some of the maturities in the funding profile. So, were running over $2 billion continued excess liquidity as we enter into the back half of the year. If you take out all the excess liquidity from here, that\u2019s probably another 40 basis points out to the net interest margin that you'd you see a lift from. Again, we\u2019ve highlighted before if I have 20 basis points to 30 basis points from benchmark rates, so put that off to the side, the residual comes in probably two dashes one is late fees which you probably 80 basis points to 90 basis points a lift going back to a normalized late fee relative to not even an about higher than 5.5 but their normal load and you have the residual which will be the revolve when payment rates come back in line. So, the one thing I\u2019d say is we do not see anything in the portfolio today that gives us any indication that the measures margin in that 16% realm is not going to be the mean that we go back to and we\u2019ll be continue to watch it but there\u2019s nothing fundamentally or structurally that we think is different, it\u2019s just really the time when we get there, given the excess liquidities that the consumer has and that they're going to deploy here in the short term. Mark Devries : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a follow up question on Brian on your comments about your partners really wanting to kind of stimulate the longer lifecycle with customers, do they find that using the revolving products what they've got, incentives on spend is the best way to do that as opposed to offering some type of maybe a lower rate kind of fixed loan product on balances? Brian Doubles : Yeah Mark, I mean, it really does vary by partner, but I would say the majority, particularly the larger partners, they see the value of the value prop. Right, the rewards, the loyalty that that drives when they go into one of our large partners and a lot of time they\u2019re savings 5%, that is really meaningful. We do that at Amazon, we do at Lowe's, and we do at number of places now. And that is, that\u2019s a great way to incent that repeat purchases. I think the other thing that we've been doing for a number of years now and most of partners we store, the card is the default payment type. And so you don't even have to think about it. It just goes right on the card you gave your 5% and that\u2019s something that our partners have been very focused on as well to drive that. Again the lifetime relationship with the cardholder and the loyalty that comes with it. Mark Devries : Okay and I assume that they will get the fastest checkout using their revolving products, correct? Brian Doubles : Yeah, it\u2019s just instant all right, the stores I know for Amazon for me the store is my default, I get my 5%, I don\u2019t even think about it, it is just a lot, it goes on automatically on the card. So, it\u2019s certainly the easiest and fastest way to check out for most of our partners. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is [indiscernible] on for Mihir Bhatia, thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about how urban costs are trending but I made on emerging [indiscernible] portfolios, while we have noticed or how many awards [indiscernible] industries that\u2019s additive or if you\u2019re going to [indiscernible] portfolio and try to get your customers. Brian Doubles : Yeah, your quality wasn't that clear you're asking about the loyalty cost trends. Unidentified Analyst : Right, is that increasing for the newer portfolio that has been done well like more promotions [indiscernible] I wondering if it\u2019s additive or representative portfolio for new customer acquisitions? Brian Doubles : Yeah, the way I would think about the loyalty cost you know first of high time was up significantly year of year over year versus 2019 so you\u2019re going to see a general trend in loyalty cost because higher more certainly than new growth programs at Verizon and Venmo, we\u2019ll have those cost and then set have to higher percent of the assets because the assets are just beginning to build, but it's not significantly different than our overall portfolio, not necessarily the drivers would really the increase purchase volume across the entire portfolio that's driving our value for the loyalty costs. Operator : And we have our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. Can you -- we obviously have the new segments that you\u2019ve broken up the new platforms. Can you talk about the differences in each of the platforms that have made you decide to break them up this way and as far as you know the marketing teams to go to market strategy and if they are actually running a software that's different among them? Thanks so much guys. Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure so the reason to reorganize you know in align more by industry was couple of all. First in terms of your point the products and capabilities that we offer tend to align better by industry and even more important than that how we integrate in the products and capabilities and how we integrate into the digital environment or the store footprint, tends to align as well by the industry. So, one example, for our purely digital of players pent up Venmo, Amazon we\u2019re integrating through our API technology or through SyPI technology right inside of their house and that's different than what we would do in home and auto where for some of our larger partners were integrating both in their digital environment, mobile online and but we also have to tools and technologies to apply and buy in-store. And so, because of the product -- the products that we tend to be cared more towards the industry because of the types of products that they\u2019re selling as well as whether or not they are purely digital or have a store footprint, it just made more sense to aligned by industry. And the second piece of this when we saw this in CareCredit over the last 30 years, it really is an advantage to get really deep domain expertise in an industry. And one of the things that I think has been a secret to our success in CareCredit is that domain expertise, our teams get -- they build lifetime relationships, they get really deep in the different domains that we support et cetera. And we're trying to replicate that in these other platforms, so those were the two primary reasons. I can tell you it's been great just a couple of months in having these teams in place, looking at these segments different way of seeing, kind of natural synergies and ideas for new products and capabilities, as they're out talking to partners and thinking about it, more with the industry than to itself. So, far the progress has been really great. Dominick Gabriele : Great, great, thank you for that detail and then you know this might be a longshot but can you talk about the tender share by each of those and if not specific numbers because I know that's unlikely may be just perhaps which one of the segments is you know at the average tender share below and above average of the whole company. And then we think about the RSA in the second quarter, is that the high what the market you think about? NCL rates stayed roughly -- fairly in line with where they are for the rest of this year with high watermark on a percentage basis for the RSA? Thank you very much, I really appreciate you guys. Brian Doubles : Yeah, let me start on the penetration question. I would say across each of those platforms we've got significant room to grow penetration -- inside of each of those platforms we\u2019ve start up programs where were relatively small percentage of the payments inside of those programs and we have very mature programs where we can be 30%, 40% spend what I can tell you is we measure our teams on increasing that penetration rate regardless at where they are at. So, even for the more mature programs our teams that are embedded inside of our partners they get measured based on growth and driving that incremental tender share. So even in our mature programs we are very focused on that penetration rate. Now Brian if you want to take the second piece of that? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, so RSA yield if you just think about the RSA the back half, there are two factors really to focus on is, one the purchase volume rates as RSAs is not only sharing there is buying oriented purchases so the strength in purchases you have seen in the back half of the year h and then how the next charge off and provisional line continues to develop you know I mentioned earlier on the call we expect the NCL rate for the full year to be below 4%, but if you\u2018re already incremental -- ACL releases that could impact it. So, we\u2019ll remain elevated in the back half of the year from where we are -- directly but it should be dramatically larger than what we saw in the second quarter. Kathryn Miller : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And thank you, our last question is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Good morning as you look to further out, do see the normalization of the payment rates providing a tailwind to the normalization of your revolve rates, such as we can see a loan growth starts to outpace your spending growth, if you could speak to that dynamic? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, you know clearly we've reached that we said that we believe payment rate will move back to domain that will accelerate loan growth and more certainly if you had a slowing purchase buying in market that could push the loan growth ahead of the purchase volume growth began again with the way we\u2019ve thought about the back half of the year and it hasn't really changed -- back half heading into 2020 that you are going to continue to see elevated purchase volumes -- one from the pent up demand that we see and as we talk to our partners, merchants and providers that you can see the consumers has well evolved with the savings to continue to spend. So, I think over the next 18 months you\u2019re going to continue to see elevated purchase volumes Bill and then you\u2019re going to combine that with a moderation payment rates in the [indiscernible] over time. So, just the two will work in [indiscernible]. Bill Carcache : Got it and then separately on capital there has been some step decisions on your ability to get down to your levels of capital. Can you speak to what is your confidence, you can get there and I might have missed this but any commentary on the potential for your increasing the authorization about your current plan? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, you know Bill I'm going through the first point to back to little bit of history right as we separated from GE we had an 18% capital levels, we\u2019ve worked that down to 14% over a couple of years three, four years. So, we've demonstrated the ability -- we've demonstrated the ability just before the pandemic to take that capital I think to $3.3 billion in the nine months period before the pandemic happened. So, I think we have the ability and demonstrate capability to do that. So, I think we\u2019re confident in our ability to get down there now. With regards to the current authorization right -- we talked about this a little bit in the first quarter that is a backwards looking authorization rates so the data which we used through our stress scenarios under our processes and governments mechanisms were based off December and early January assumptions, right. So that's where we had the capital plans put together and approved by our board. If things continue to change, we\u2019ll evaluate whether or not there is a desire for the broad shifting to increase that authorization level and we'll revisit that but right now we have to $2.5 billion remaining, we've executed $593 million so far this year which were slightly regulated by the restrictions put on, as I said. And we will be aggressive with regards to our execution against the $2.5 million and again if the environment warrants, we will revisit that. Kathryn Miller : And thank all for joining us this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you have. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentleman this concludes our earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com.  This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.  During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the Company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for, and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn. Good morning, everyone. The power of Synchrony's model continue to show through in our third quarter financial results. We continue to reach and serve more partners and customers. New accounts grew 17% to 6.2 million, an average active accounts increased 5% to 67.2 million during the period. This is in large part attributable to the powerful combination of our data-driven insights, our seamless customer experiences, and our industry-leading product suite, which resonates deeply with customers. Synchrony 's omnichannel capability enable our partners and customers to connect wherever and whenever they want to be met and the variety of financing options and value propositions we offer empowers them with choice. As we continue to anticipate and deliver on the needs of our partners and customers, we drive more value and greater utilization. This translated to an 11% increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and 16% growth in total purchase volume compared to last year. Of course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industry-wide forbearance actions, leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale. Net interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, primarily reflecting the reduction in excess liquidity. Operating expenses were down 10% compared to last year and down 7% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned.  We remain on track to reduce about 210 million from our expense base by year-end, even as we continue to invest in our business. The efficiency ratio was 38.7% for the quarter, largely flat with last year. Credit continue to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 2.18% for the third quarter, down 224 basis points from last year. Net earnings were 1.1 billion or $2 per diluted share and included $0.33 benefit from the reserve release related to the reclassification of the GAAP portfolio to held-for-sale.  Turning to our balance sheet, deposits were down 3 billion or 5% versus last year reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity. Deposits represented 82% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt. During the quarter, we returned 1.4 billion in capital through share repurchases of 1.3 billion and 124 million in common stock dividends.  We also continue to reinvest in our business. As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our ability to remain nimble and adapt to the ever changing consumer finance landscape has been driven by our continued investment in our product suite and our innovative digital capabilities. In fact, if you think about the last decade alone, the introduction of digital wallets, point-of-sale financing, and a greater variety of installment offerings, just to name a few, has demonstrated the importance of diversity, accessibility, and utility in both products and experience. And so Synchrony has continuously evolved, adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform, and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all. In addition to launching new products and partner programs, we are remaining focused on innovative ways to get scaled distribution of our product suite.  Last week, we announced our expanded strategic partnership with FiServ through which small businesses will now be able to access Synchrony products and services and accept private-label credit card payments via the Clover point of sale and business management platform from FiServ. This will enable accelerated growth for small businesses, empowering merchants to attract more customers, and generate more revenue by offering our customers greater flexibility and choice in how they make purchases.  We will also explore additional opportunities to cross-sell Synchrony products to existing Clover merchants. Importantly, this strategic partnership also deepens Synchrony's ecosystem and reinforces our growth strategy to expand and accelerate innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels. It builds on our momentum to bring our products to merchants faster and leverages Synchrony's leadership and financing, analytics, and services. We're excited to utilize the point of sale innovations driven by Clover to continue to transform the way people purchase while helping merchants grow. Furthermore, as we and our partners endeavor to provide more comprehensive customer access to financial products and resources, we are excited to expand our partnership with PayPal. As announced in late September, Synchrony, we'll be launching PayPal savings, a new PayPal branded savings account. This unique opportunity will allow us to expand the distribution of our savings product to a unique set of customers with features and functionality inside the PayPal App delivering an enhanced customer experience, while also further diversifying our deposit base at an attractively low cost to acquire. In addition to our ongoing efforts to expand both our product suite and distribution network, we also seek to enhance partner and customer engagement through customized value propositions and omnichannel capabilities.  We recently launched 2 industry first, retail health and wellness credit cards : the myWalgreens MasterCard and myWalgreens private-label credit card, which reward customers with savings on future health and wellness purchases. myWalgreens credit card holders can earn 10% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible Walgreens branded products and 5% Walgreens cash rewards on other eligible brands and pharmacy purchases. myWalgreens MasterCard holders can also earn 3% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible grocery and health and wellness purchases everywhere else, including healthcare providers and 1% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible purchases anywhere MasterCard credit cards are accepted. In a world where consumers are increasingly responsible for a greater proportion of their health-related costs, we believe the value propositions will drive considerable value while also providing greater financing flexibility for health-related needs and enhancing loyalty over time. Furthermore, Synchrony's digital capabilities allow us to seamlessly engage with customers wherever they are. We have deep digital integration across the Walgreens web, mobile, and native app channels with the ability for customers to apply an instantly by, through all of these channels.  We've launched frictionless customer experiences, leveraging technology capabilities like QR codes, quick screen, which is a real-time pre -screen in one, customer initiated pre -qualification, a directed device in-store application process, card servicing integrated seamlessly into the Walgreens app, an API integration with the myWalgreens loyalty program. And while it's still early, the initial data we're seeing indicates that both the value prop and dynamic customer experience we have achieved with Walgreens are resonating very well with card holders and driving spend both inside and outside of Walgreens in categories such as grocery, health, and wellness. By empowering our partners and customers with best-in-class wallet optionality, and compelling outcomes, Synchrony is increasingly well-positioned as the partner of choice. With more than 65 million active accounts, Synchrony has market-leading reach and deep diverse lending insights that enable us to better anticipate the needs of customers, And therefore, which financing options will optimize utilization and drive lifetime value.  So whether it comes in the form of our dual, co-branded, and private-label credit cards, our various SEP pay installment products or our Synchrony MasterCard. We deeply understand when, why, and how customers see financing solutions for their day-to-day purchases. We're particularly excited about the opportunity we see for our Synchrony MasterCard, which allows us to tap into the 500 billion general purpose credit card market. We're taking a measured approach to growth. However, by leveraging our scale and underwriting expertise, we've been able to identify better performing customer segments, acquire more customers at lower CPAs, and fine-tuned our channel strategy over the last two years.  Today Synchrony MasterCard offers a variety of value propositions which we used in combination with our pricing strategy to expand our customer reach and optimize conversion. And we have great digital utility through dApply and integration in Apple wallet, as well as our mobile app. This allows customers to access their various bank products, their money market, and high-yield savings accounts, as well as our credit card balances and transaction data. This value proposition in seamless digital experience resonates very well with our customer leading to purchase volume growth of 36% versus the same period in 2019. We're also seeing higher levels of engagement around the product and brand as spend per active account is up 40% versus 2019. So we're very excited about our Synchrony MasterCard. It's an important offering within our product suite strategy that we believe will enable us to capture a larger portion of customers top-of-wallet spend in which to drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long term. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflect a broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies, and continued cost discipline. The combination of these results led to $1.1 billion in net earnings or $2 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4.9%, and a return on tangible common equity of 40.1%.  These results are a true testament to the power of Synchrony's unique business model, which builds on our deep domain expertise in consumer lending and leverages dynamic digital capabilities delivered through our comprehensive multi-products suite to reach and serve deep and diverse universe of partners and customers. Looking at our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019, excluding Walmart demonstrates clear, broad-based strength in consumer demand. This is also reflected in our purchase volume per account, which increased 11% compared to last year. Dual card and co-branded cards account for 40% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased 29% from the prior year.  On a loan receivable basis, excluding the impact of the reclassification to GAAP portfolio to held-for-sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of the portfolio and increased 4% from the prior year. Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 17%, totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the third quarter, and over 17.5 million new accounts year-to-date. In late August, we reached an agreement for the sale of the GAAP portfolio, which led to the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables to held-for-sale and therefore reduced our ending loan receivables balance. Excluding the impact of the reclassification, loan receivables would have increased by 2% versus the prior year as the period's strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate. Payment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher when compared to the last year. Interest and fees on loans increased 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables.  Net interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates. RSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, and 6.38% of average receivables. The $367 million a year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of the lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance, including growth and improvement in net interest income.  To put this in context, remember that our RSAs are designed to align interest between ourselves and each of our partners. This means driving growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns, enhancing program profitability. This allows each partner to share the progress performance. So if profitability expands, our partners participate in that upside. Now when you think about the combined $1.4 billion a year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses, and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA. Focusing our credit performance provision for losses was $25 million. Included in this quarter's provision was reserve release of $407 million, which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance and we're optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our GAAP portfolio loan receivables to held-for-sale.  This resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million. Other income decreased $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter. Other expense decreased $106 million compared to the prior year. As you recall, last year we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses.  Moving to Slide 8, our platform results. We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all 5 platforms, reflecting strong consumer demand. Our HOME and auto, diversified and value, digital, and health and wellness platforms each experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume. The 10% year-over-year increase in home and auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals while purchase volume and diversified value increased 25%, reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences.  In digital, the 21% increase was due to broad-based growth across our partners. Coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo. In health and wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures. Meanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in Lifestyle, reflecting broad-based growth across the platform. But having a tough comparable to last year's strong growth in power sports.  Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected modest growth rates versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates. The one exception being in our diversified and value platform, which was impacted by store closures in 2020. Average active accounts trends range on a platform basis, up by as much as 10% diversified value and 7% in digital, while home and auto and health and wellness average active accounts were generally flat. The active account growth in diversified value largely reflected the return to in-store retail experiences. Digital active accounts were up versus prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base, as well as the impact of recent program launches. Interest in fee trends were generally improved across the platform with the exception of diversified value, which is down due to lower receivables. I'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends.  The cumulative savings by consumers resulting from stimulus, forbearance, and lower discretionary spending, continued to impact the payment rates during the third quarter. Paying rates were approximately 260 basis points higher than our five-year store [Indiscernible] average. That said, we've begun to see some signs of moderation in certain cohorts as payment rate was about 200 basis points higher year-over-year compared to almost 300 basis points higher year-over-year comparison in the second quarter.  We expect the pay rate to gradually normalize as consumer spending remains robust, excess savings have peaked, and widespread forbearance dissipates. Interest and fees were up approximately 2% in the third quarter reflecting average loan receivable growth. Net interest income increased 6% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees, as well as lower interest expense for the period. The net interest margin was 15.45% compared to last year's margin of 13.8%, 165 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by the mix of interest earning assets and favorable interest-bearing liabilities cost. More specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 550 basis points from 78.3% to 83.8% driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter.  This accounted for 106 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.31%, a year-over-year improvement of 59 basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates and funding mix. This provided a 51 basis point increase in our net interest margin. The loan receivables yield was 19.59% a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points. This resulted in eight basis point improvement in our net interest margin.  Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. First, let's discuss our delinquency trends or higher payment trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvements. Our 30+ delinquency rate was 2.42% compared to 2.67% last year. Our 90+ delinquency rate was 1.05% compared to 1.24% last year. It should be noted that removing the impact of the GAAP program from the third quarters of this year and last year, the 30+ delinquency metric would have been down about 40 basis points versus 25 basis points.  And the 90+ metric would be down about 25 basis points instead of 19 basis points. And in terms of our portfolio's loss performance, our net charge-off rate was 2.18% compared to 4.42% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong delinquency trend we've experienced. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.28%. Let's move to slide 11 and discuss expenses.  Overall, expenses were down $106 million or 10% from last year to $961 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the prior year's restructuring charge of $89 million and lower operational losses. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.7% compared to 39.7% last year. This metric remains elevated relative to our historical average due to lower revenue resulting from the impact of higher payment rate and lower average receivables. We continue to maintain our disciplined focus on cost containment, while we make strategic investments in our business to deepen our competitive advantage and drive long-term value for shareholders. Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021 coupled with the strength of our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile.  As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our [Indiscernible] mix during the third quarter. Our deposits declined by $3.2 billion from last year, and our securitize and unsecured funding sources declined by $3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 82% of our funding compared to 80% last year, was securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter-end.  Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was 18.4 billion, which equated to 20% of our total assets, down from 28% last year. Before I provide detail on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two primary benefits. First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years. And second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment.  With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.1% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 130 basis points above last year's level of 15.8%. The tier 1 capital ratio was 18% on the CECL transition rules compared to 16.7% last year. The total capital ratio increased 120 basis points to 19.3%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 26.6% compared to 27.3% last year. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, which included $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $124 million in common stock dividends. Our business generate strong returns and considerable capital resulting from our commitment to drive growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns, scalability of our technology platform, and our ongoing cost discipline. We will continue to take the opportunistic approach to returning our excess capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions.  Finally, let me focus on our outlook for the fourth quarter, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation. While there are a number of external variables that are difficult to predict with precision, we generally expect the third quarter's key operating trends to be stable in the fourth quarter. Underpinning our forecast is a stable and improving macroeconomic environment and the pandemic continue to be largely in control.  We expect strong consumer demand through the holiday season to support continue strength in purchase volume. This strength, partially offset by continued elevation of payment rates, should lead to a modest growth in receivables. Our net interest marginal likely be consistent with 3Q '21. Our provision for credit losses will continue to reflect the impact of asset growth, credit performance, and macroeconomic factors, as well as continued reserve reductions related to the GAAP portfolio. As credit losses begin to normalize, we expect the RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to begin to moderate.  Lastly, turning to operating expense, we expect the acceleration in purchase volume to contribute to a slight sequential increase in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter. That said, we continue to expect the full-year operating expenses to be down, compared to 2020. As we close out the year and look forward to the future, we're excited about the opportunities we see to continue to drive strong financial results and shareholder value. We are well-positioned to execute on the strategy we laid out during our Investor Day and drive sustainable growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns simply by continuing to leverage our inherent core strengths. The breadth and depth of our business model, the scalability of our innovative digital capabilities, and customer lifetime value expansion we drive through our diversified product suite and powerful value propositions. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. I'm really proud of the results that we, as a team, continue to deliver for Synchrony's partners, customers, and stakeholders. We have a truly unique understanding of the wide range of needs that our partners and customers seek to address at any given time. And our differentiated approach to addressing those needs enables us to deliver solutions and experiences that deeply resonate.  Whether it's through the optionality embedded within our diverse product suite and customized value propositions, or the many ways in which we power the connection between our partners and customers, Synchrony continues to reach, engage, and serve more customers and drive greater, more sustainable outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to 1 primary and 1 follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Brian Doubles : Good morning, Betsy. Brian Wenzel : Morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I just had a couple of questions. I wanted to understand what you're thinking about with regard to the purchase volume and the spend volume that you've been generating so far. I know it's been accelerating. It feels like it's a little bit light at some of the general purpose card activity that we've seen out there, and would want to get your thoughts on that. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Well, let me start and Brian can jump in if he has other other comments, Betsy. What I would say is in comparison to general-purpose cards, they had a larger dip and larger exposures to some T&E and some other purchases that we did not drop as much as them last year. I think when we look at the purchase volume, first of all, it's broad-based across all our platforms, we have seen really solid performance.  The exception being Lifestyle, which again had a very difficult comp last year with regard to power sports and outdoor power equipment. But when we looked at it through the quarter, it was actually incredibly consistent from the first week of the quarter and each week as we move throughout the quarter, and that's really extended in here through the first couple of weeks of October.  So we are very pleased about the activity level on the card. It's very broad-based. Even a little exposure that we had to with travel and entertainment, we saw that pop up with our travel being up 75% on our either co-branded card or the Synchrony MasterCard. Restaurants were up 44%. So we're seeing that growth. But our business is very consistent, and we think that's really a strength as we move through here into the fourth quarter. Brian Doubles : I think the only thing I would add [Indiscernible] is where we're also seeing really good growth on new accounts. And so that's really seating what we think is going to be strong purchase growth as we move into '22. So new accounts were up 17% when you adjust for Walmart up 37%. So it's a really good growth on new accounts, which is really a good indicator I think for quarters to come. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. No, I got that. That was definitely impressive. And then when I'm thinking about the outlook here, I know there's a lot of verbiage around moderately up and down, things like that. I just wanted to hone in on the RSI and understand how we should be thinking about that. Realized that the profitability of the programs is up this quarter, given the strength in NIM and given the strength in credit, I guess I'm wondering if I think forward, how to think about that RSA trajectory. Because the rate of change in those two categories obviously starts to come down and credit starts to build. But then at the same time, there's marketing and other types of expenses that come into that RSA. And I'm wondering how I should think through the degree to which [Indiscernible] What's the new normal we should be angling to. Brian Doubles : Betsy, I just want to go back and continue to ground home the fact that the RSAs are working as their design, right where the profitability of the Company, as it expands, we're going to share more on the RSA. So that is by design. It's the buffer we all want when in the downside is, but we prefer the upside. So right now, we're just going to -- we're going to pay more. I think you should think about Brian Wenzel : the trajectory as you move forward, it's going to move more in line with the NIM in the business and the net charge-offs. So we would expect charge-offs here probably at a trough and would barely go up. So as the charge-offs begin to increase, that's going to go directly through and there's not really a lag effect when it comes to charge-offs through the RSA. And I think -- if you just think about the margin of the business and the revenue side of the business as delinquencies begin to rise, your revenue goes up, so that will flow through.  And then when you just start to get the write-offs come through, the NIM will come down a little bit. So I think it's going to move hopefully in parallel. The only lag effect is on the change in reserves but it should move with the business. And again, we think we're probably at the trough on delinquencies now but we'll see how it develops. But we're pleased with the performance, we're pleased with how the RSA actually moved, because it moved in line with the business results. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thank you, Betsy. Operator : And thank you. We have our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. New accounts up 17%, I'm wondering, can you give us an idea of how much -- how many of that's coming from the new channels like Verizon and Venmo versus just deeper penetration in some of the more seasoned partnerships? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. John, the way I would frame it is if the new programs were they are performing with our expectation with regard to account performance? That's not really going to be large enough to be a driver on our business given the scale. So we really see it in some of the traditional retailers that have opened up and returned to that in-store retail experience, as well as the continued expansion inside the digital programs and platforms that we have.  So it's really fairly broad-based. We have not seen any areas we're lagging behind. I think as people have really started to engage post-pandemic, if I call it that, in shopping experiences. And I think it goes back to the multi-products that we have. It goes back to the compelling value propositions we have and it's broad-based. So we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and into the holiday season. Brian Doubles : Yeah, John, I would say and it's obviously a combination of you got Venmo, you got Verizon, you got Walgreens, very attractive, new value profit Sam's Club. But I also attribute a large portion to the digital investments that we've been making. So we have made it so much easier to apply whether your in-store on your phone, online. You can really do it in a matter of seconds now. You just put in a couple of fields.  You do it right on your phone, even if you're in-store by scanning a QR code. So just making it easier to apply. I think all the macro tailwinds are certainly there in terms of what we're experiencing the business. But this is where the digital investments that we've been making over the past five-years are really starting to pay off. John Hecht : Okay. That's helpful, thanks. And then 2nd question is, can you just give us what's the remaining reserve release for the GAAP? Brian Wenzel : Yes. John, I would say the overall provision was around 400 million, got about 150 million more over the next couple of quarters to come through. The exact timing of that and cadence will really depend upon the performance of the portfolio as we move through it. But obviously the first piece is always the biggest in the held-for-sale accounting. John Hecht : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks, John. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Singh with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks, everybody and good morning. I'd like to talk a little bit about the online sales metric that you posted, which is 40%. And I'm curious where you think that is versus the peer average on general purpose and how it compares to your general purpose because as we think about the resumption of spend as the economy reopens, I'm wondering if there's leverage there because you do more in person than some of your peers. Brian Wenzel : Look, I think that's a metric that obviously we believe we over-indexed in terms of online and mobile sales. Just look at our partners at with Amazon, and PayPal, and Verizon, and others. I think that there's certainly leverage there. If you look at the portfolio mix, and we broke this out a little bit at Investor Day in terms of where we see a lot of the growth coming longer term inside the Company. It's clearly going to be over-indexed in terms of online sales.  That's speaking particularly to our digital partners as they become a larger share of the overall business. But I will say that for some of the more traditional partners that we have, we have been, I believe, instrumental and helping them transform their footprints to be more digital. So that has been a big part of what we've tried to do, particularly over the last couple of years in response to the pandemic.  Many of our partners had to close stores, they moved a lot of their sales online. And we're a big part of how they were able to meet that need and transform their businesses. So certainly leverage going forward right, for sure. Rick Shane : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Brian, just wonder if you could talk a little bit of -- I mean, it seems like 30-day plus day delinquencies of trough here and as you look forward, we're going to normalize. When do you think they'll start turning positive year-over-year? Is that mid next year type event, or can you talk about that normalization process? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Don, good morning. I think if I were to lay out for you two cases on delinquency, the first being a little bit more conservative, which says you have a more sharper rise in delinquency that would begin starting here in the fourth quarter would peak third quarter next year and result in that charge-off peak in the first quarter of '23. So that's a more conservative case. And the basis for that case becomes one where as you have individuals coming off of -- consumers coming off of forbearance, government assistance, renter forbearance that they have not been able to sustain enough savings in order to avoid that, so that's a sharper case, a more conservative case.  A more optimistic case would say you would see a slower rise in delinquencies as you move through '22 into '23 and then really your loss rate comes back in line end of '23 into '24. And I say in line being back to the mean and call it 5.5%. So it's a much more gradual rise. And that premises on the fact that the consumers were able to build up enough savings so that when the financial obligations come back online for them, they are able to continue to pay their bills and meet it. Those are the the bookends that I would think about. Don Fandetti : That's really helpful. Thank you, Brian. Anything on the acquisition side, whether it's bolt-on fintechs or portfolios, anything that you're looking at that could be good candidates there? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. I would say, look, we have a very active M&A pipeline. The teams are out there screening for opportunities every day. I will tell you that the one thing we're hoping to see in the pandemic was valuations coming back down to earth a bit. In fact, we saw the opposite. So things are still really expensive out there, both in terms of capabilities as well as businesses. So we're certainly looking at a number of things, I'd say existing businesses where we can leverage our scale to grow those businesses.  I think Allegro Credits is a great example of that. That's best and great example of that where we're able to leverage our scaling in Care Credit and health and wellness and buy those businesses and really grow them well, which we shared a little bit at Investor Day around how we did that. But we're going to be disciplined. We're looking for acquisitions that are not only strategic, but accretive. And so we stayed pretty disciplined on that, but the team is very active on that product. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Okay. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I just have 1 question for Brian Wenzel and 1 for Brian Doubles. Brian Wenzel, on the guidance, if we look at the net interest margin expectation, I guess, you guys are assuming there's going to be an acceleration on loan growth, and we should have higher delinquency,. Shouldn't that help the NIM? So shouldn't the NIM actually be better as we move into next quarter, or are there other factors that are weighing against it? Brian Wenzel : Well, first of all, good morning, Sanjay. A couple of factors you're gonna see the loan growth, which obviously goes into denominator. It actually pushes the NIM down. And then when you think about it, you are getting -- you will get a little bit offset as you see some of the charge-offs and delinquency rise, you will see a little bit of the write-off reversal that goes back through.  So it's not necessarily out of line with I think, past years, if you look back a couple of years ago. So it should be aligned with that. But again, we're very pleased with the NIM being up in the 15+% range that I know a lot of people focused on when we were 165 basis points lower than where we are today. So we're obviously pleased with this performance. Sanjay Sakhrani : Absolutely. No, It was a good sequential move, clearly. And then Brian Doubles, obviously you guys have done a number of or maybe a number of moves just in this last quarter : the Pay in 4 product announcement, this embedded finance relationship with PayPal and the Clover partnership and you talked in the press release about positioning for diverse universe of partners.  I was just curious how we should think about other, like the product pipeline going forward. Are there other deals like that where you going to be an embedded partner from a financial standpoint for other technology players? And then just how does it play into the business model, like the revenues and expenses on a go-forward basis? Does the complexion of those revenues change or how should we think about it? Thanks. Brian Doubles : I wouldn't Sanjay. I'd take a step back and think about our strategy really in two big pieces. One, is very focused on products. And we spent a lot of time on this in Investor Day. We believe we have the most comprehensive product suite out there, whether it's private label, dual co-brand cards, buy now, pay later, short and long-term installment. And so, we feel like that is, obviously, really important, given the diversity of our partner's stand and what they want from us.  The other really important part of the strategy is really around distribution of those financial products. So this is -- think about integration into the merchants and providers, making it easier to apply for those products and really getting that scale. So it's one thing to have the products, but you got to have the distribution channels as well. And so if you go back over time, we do a lot in terms of direct partner integrations. So that's leveraging our APIs Synchrony plug-in, etc. But in some cases, we're looking to expand distribution through practice management systems like Aptec. Anytime we can build a solution once and reach thousands of merchants, we absolutely want to do that, and that's really what Clover does for us. With the development of a single app, we can reach thousands of merchants. We can tap into their, roughly, 180 billion of GPV. So we think this is a big opportunity and allows us to do something once and get immediate scale.  And so, if there -- We're looking -- we're actively looking at other opportunities to do that for our products. But this is really, think about it as really two-pronged approach. You got to have the product set, but then you got to have a distribution channel or a setting distribution channels that allow you to scale quickly and get those products made available to our merchants and their customers. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks Sanjay. Operator : We have our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow up on credit. As we look ahead to NCO rates normalizing higher off these low levels, there has been some concern that this could lead to reserve building headwinds. But since your reserve rate is still well above your day 1 level of just under 10%, is it reasonable to expect that reserve rate is going to continue to drift lower from here, even as NCO rates normalize higher, such that that credit normalization process does not necessarily lead to reserve building headwinds? Just some high level commentary around that. Those dynamics would be super helpful. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks and good morning, Bill. The way I think about charge-offs and the reserve build, our reserve build will still really be driven by asset builds and the macroeconomic assumptions. You are correct, we're operating now 11 -- just under 11.3%. Our CSO day 1 was 10% and we expect that migration to happen over time. Now, again, CSO day one was 10%. We never actually had a normal quarter under CSO. But if you use that as a guidepost, that's where we would expect to move back towards. So you're right, there will be some rate, but again, asset builds will dominate. So the reserve provisioning, there may be reserve builds that come that are partially offset by more normal rate reductions as you move closer, depending upon how again, how credit performs and how the macroeconomic looks. But it won't avoid reserve builds if you're in an asset-increasing environment. Bill Carcache : Understood. That's really helpful. If I could squeeze in, one last on buy now, pay later, have your Pay in 4 and other long-term installment product options been rolled out across your entire merchant base? I know it's still early, but are you seeing any evidence of cannibalization from existing Synchrony customers with traditional Synchrony revolving credit product that have signed up or paying for that Pay in 4 option or is the customer just signing up for Pay in 4 typically somebody who might not even have qualified for credit and they're just using Pay in 4 to turn their debit card into a credit card? Would appreciate your thoughts there. Brian Wenzel : Why don't why don't we just take a step back, though, I think -- And I'll break buy now, pay later into a couple of categories because I think right now everything is getting lumped into buy now, pay later. And as we've indicated in the past we do about 15 billion of installment, both short and long term.  We offer those products in about 70 thousand locations today. And I really think about it in two buckets. First, you've got what we call closed-end installment or buy-now-pay-later. That's growing really well for us. So that is just a closed-end loan, very simple, a number of different durations. And if you look over the past 3 years from 2017 to 2020, Brian Doubles : the purchase volume on those closed-end products has grown at about 46% a year, so we're definitely seeing really good traction there. We have buy now, pay later in market today with partners like Tula (ph), American Signature, Electronics Express. That's branded as [Indiscernible]. And then we talked at Investor Day that starting in October, we will have our paying-for-product available for partners. So we're in discussions with them right now and talking about integration plans and getting that in-market.  I will tell you to your point, they are focused on exactly what you said, which is, how does this product compete with the products that they currently offer? And at Investor Day, we talked a lot about the economic equation for our partners. And I can tell you that is something that, I think 6 to 9 months ago they weren't all that focused on, but right now they are very Brian Wenzel : focused on it. So they're looking at the trade-offs between a traditional product where they might earn in RSA, and how does that compare to a short or long-term installment product to Pay in 4 where they're paying a merchant discount. And so, I think the way this is going to play out is, there's going to be a lot of testing and learning and seeing how these products work together, what the customer uptake is, and then, at the end of the day, what the economic equation is back to the partner.  So that's one big bucket of what we call installment, closed in, buy now, pay later. The other thing that we talked about is the buy-now-pay-later option or installment option that we offer on our cards. So on a revolving account. And this is where we continue to see a lot of really strong interest from our partners. And in part of what they like about that is you can actually do multiple installment loans or buy-now-pay-later loans without an additional credit check or application process.  It also gives the customer the ability to, when they want to, just make a regular purchase not on an installment basis and take advantage of the value prop, so save 5%, for instance, at Amazon. And what we've seen is customers really like to have that optionality. So for some purchases they want to put it on a six month or a 12 month equal pay, buy-now-pay-later product, in some cases they want to take advantage of the value prop. And what's nice about that product is it allows you to do both and really gives the customer that choice at the end of the day. The partners, on their side, they really like that because it allows them to do more lifecycle marketing, right? So they can push out offers and promotions around holiday and things like that. So they like that lifecycle relationship that they're able to maintain with the customer. So like at the end of the day, I think every one of our partners is looking at this a little bit differently. They're looking at the interplay between these products, they are looking at the economic equation. I think the good news is if you take a step back and you see how we're positioned, we have a very comprehensive suite of products. We can sit down with a partner and they can basically choose from a menu in terms of what they want to offer.  And we can lay out for them economic equation, what we think it's going to do to their sales, etc. So I feel like we're very well-positioned. We've got the product suite. We've got the ability to integrate quickly with our partners. And we think, over time, the multi-product strategy is winning one. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Bill. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good morning. I want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on your payment rate expectations. I know you expect labor rates to gradually normalize. If you could maybe help size that up. Is it similar to the third quarter decline and also are you seeing any incremental evidence of accounts that typically revolve starting to carry balances again, if maybe you can give us a little bit of granularity there. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Sure. Thanks. And good morning, John. Obviously, in the deck we showed you the elevated level that we saw in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter, again, that rate is going to continue to be elevated. I'd point you to a couple of things as we think about payment rate and the trends. We've done a lot of analysis to try to make sure that we, as we look at it, that we believe it's going to revert back to the mean, everything we have seen still leads us to that conclusion that there is a reversion back to the mean. There are a couple, I'll call underlying data points that I would try to point you to. Number 1, as we look at the savings rates for consumers, they are drifting down to more normalized level on pre -pandemic. And we look at that both the big money center banks as well as the digital oriented banks than what we see with regard to movement in our savings accounts. So one savings is coming down -- savings rate is coming down, which again, part of that is going to be the high purchase volume.  The second, we start to look at cohorts inside of our portfolio. We do see very slight movements down. So for instance, if you looked at a product level, our dual card pride sequentially, second quarter to third quarter had a slight decline in the payment rate on a product level, that's a higher FICO customer that is beginning to migrate back down.  When you look at it with regard to accounts that either pay full-pay, between full-pay, or statement balance, and min-pay, and then statement balance or less than statement balances, across all those categories, we've seen slight reduction in that paying rate. So if you think about the people who paid stated balances, that is slightly lower third quarter versus second.  The people are playing between statement balance and min-balance that is lower in the third quarter than the second quarter, and then the min-pay is up slightly third quarter versus second, and then the people paying less than the min pay is up slightly, so I think as we start seeing a very slight movement, those are movements that would tell us that the payment rate is going to move back towards the mean that we experienced pre -pandemic or we're starting to see a little bit of signs there. John Pancari : Got it now now. Thank you, Brian. It's helpful. And then secondly, on the NIM, I appreciate the color you gave earlier in terms of some of the moving parts for the linked-quarter expectation. It's there a incremental opportunity around funding that you can continue to optimize the funding stack here to support the NIM further out that we can possibly dial-in? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : In our funding stack today, we have 82% that is funded with retail deposits. We have not been an active issuer in the market either in '19, I'm sorry -- in 20 or 21. I would expect this to access the market. First, I think it's good for the liquidity of the Company. So we would expect to see a little bit of activity because we have not replaced some of that expiring debt, but I would imagine that our deposit funding rate will remain elevated versus the 70%, 75% that we historically have guided to. I think also there's an opportunity with our PayPal savings product to continue to broaden the reach to customers in retail. So we're excited about that when it comes out in the coming months. So we're going to continue to focus on trying to optimize the costs, but we also want to maintain access to the deep markets where that secured, unsecured.  As we begin to give the capital stack and order, we would probably access additional funds to build out the capital stack of the Company and get down to our target level. So we intend to be an active issuer over time and do it in a way that optimizes the cost. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, Brian. I appreciate you taking my questions. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, Operator. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark Devries : Yes. Thanks. Made a lot of progress in the quarter against your repurchase authorization. Could you just discuss the cadence of buybacks going forward and whether we should expect anything incremental as you sell the GAAP portfolio? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. The GAAP -- The way the GAAP capital releases, obviously we've had a portion of the reserve release that's a smaller portion that flow backs through capital this quarter, the bulk of the reserve release will happen in the second quarter next year when we intend to convey that portfolio. So that will probably be included in our next capital plan. We have $1.2 billion remaining under the existing authorization that we have as we enter the quarter. So we're pleased with how we repurchased shares during the third quarter. As we said before, we will be aggressive, but prudent as we move forward here.  And as always, we'll continue to run our internal stress test model, evaluate the performance of the business and the income profile and to the extent that we believe it's prudent, we'll engage discussions with our board about potentially increasing the authorization. But right now, we have $1.2 billion ahead of us. And again, we want to be aggressive, but prudent as we continue to reduce the capital level of Company towards closer to our long-term target. Mark Devries : Got it. That's helpful. And separate question, could you just discuss expectations for go-forward OpEx as you weigh the different crosscurrents of your ongoing cost containment initiatives and the runoff of the GAAP partnership against the need to continue to invest in the platform? Brian Wenzel : Our first priority from Brian and Margaret and the board is to continue to maintain the long-term investments that we have in the business in the strategic initiatives. So we do almost everything to protect that, because that's in the best interest of our shareholders, that long-term value. Around that, we've maintained a cost discipline. We've reduced a lot of costs. We had -- we're on target for our $210 million this year.  But we made some moves to invest back in certain aspects of our business. That includes going at $20 an hour for our non-exempt workforce and investing back into the business. I think as you look at the fourth quarter, there's going to be a slight increase as you think about some marketing and some things that are going to happen in the quarter. But again, we would expect as you move forward, that as revenue comes back in line, our progression back towards an efficiency level back in the low 30s and disciplined if you think about on a dollar basis as we sequentially move through '22. Mark Devries : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our earnings call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller. And Kathryn, you may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks Kathryn and good morning, everyone. We are really proud of our Synchrony team and the strong level of execution that enabled us to close the year out with such strong results, including several company records. Our core strategy to drive sustainable growth at attractive risk adjusted returns is founded on three primary objectives. First grow our existing partner programs and win new partners. Second diversify our programs, products and markets. And third, deliver best-in-class customer experiences. During 2021, we added 36 partners and renewed another 38. We're excited about the prospects in both our existing portfolio and new partner pipeline to power, innovative financing experiences and serve the ever changing needs of our customers. As you know, we are constantly seeking opportunities to extend our leadership position and much of that will continue to be driven by the ongoing diversification and expansion of our distribution channels. To that end, we acquired Allegro Credit at the beginning of the year, a leading provider of point of sale consumer audiology products. This acquisition allowed us to deepen our foothold in the health and wellness space, reaching more providers and customers and empowering them with an expanded suite of financing products and services. We also announced our strategic partnership with Clover, which will enable us to deliver our innovative products and experiences to more merchants and customers. As a reminder, our integration with Clover will enable small businesses to access Synchrony financing products and services, and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform. In addition, Synchrony continued to expand our two main consumer-facing marketplaces, mysynchrony.com and carecredit.com during the year. These marketplaces are broad and deep networks that provide consumers with a one-stop shop to find and shop with merchant partners and providers as well as submit applications and service their accounts. And through the broad reach, easy accessibility and strong utility of these networks, Synchrony is driving strong repeat sales. Combined annual visits across these networks surpassed $300 million by year-end, and we drove about 1 million referrals and received almost 19 million provider views through carecredit.com. Repeat sales across our networks were 52% in the fourth quarter of 2021. An additional metric that we are focused on driving is sales per active account, which are about twice as high in our CareCredit, and home and auto networks compared to the average buy now pay later products that we see in the marketplace. This is a testament to the deep customer relationships that our network products foster. Synchrony's ability to leverage our networks and drive new customers and repeat sales to our partners at higher spend levels has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator, an important growth driver for our business. Another element of our continued diversification and expansion over the last year includes our health system initiative, through which we successfully signed seven new systems, bringing our total to 20. By integrating with health systems through technology platforms like Epic, Synchrony is able to meaningfully extend our customer and provider reach while also enhancing the utility of our CareCredit card. For example, the Epic MyChart user base spans about 150 million patients. And by making our patient financing app available within the Epic App Orchard, we're able to provide those patients with expanded access to financing options wherever the provider or health system is part of the CareCredit network across a broad range of needs from elective care to routine medical expenses and non-elective care needs. In an environment where insurance coverage is increasingly limited, but health and wellness needs arising, we are empowering more patients and providers with greater choice, flexibility and utility as we expand our networks and integrate with more health systems. So overall, 2021 was the year in which we accelerated our business strategy. Through strategic partnerships like Clover, we can expand our reach by tens of thousands of new merchants. Through the expansion of our digital networks, we can reach hundreds of millions of consumers. And collectively, the health systems with which we have launched CareCredit and some capacity have over 40 million patient visits. No matter how you look at it, Synchrony is at the center of a large cross-section of commerce in the U.S., regardless of whether the purchase takes place in person or digitally. We connect almost 70 million average active accounts through seamless omnichannel experiences to nearly 450,000 locations. And we power their everyday purchases, from furniture and home improvement to health care products and services, car care needs and clothing, jewelry and powersports. With customized financing options that optimize value and outcomes for both our customers and partners. The more consumers, merchants, providers and partners that Synchrony reaches the more diverse the demand for products, services and value propositions becomes, so we continue to diversify both our products and programs in 2021 with the launch of our industry-first program with Walgreens and the introduction of our SetPay Pay-in-4 product. In addition, we continue to advance the growth of our Synchrony Mastercard, which represents an important opportunity within our product strategy to drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long term. During the second half of the year, we broadened our Synchrony Mastercard acquisition efforts to include new digital channels, expanding our reach and accelerating our speed to market. With the real-time activity and data capture, along with our sophisticated dApply capabilities, which include advanced pre-fill and credit decisioning insights, we streamlined the application process and optimized the customer experience. As a result, active accounts grew 11% in the second half compared to the first half of the year. And thanks to the compelling value propositions we offer, our sales per active account grew 18% on the same basis. Of course, as we continue to expand our wallet share, Synchrony is able to reach and serve more customers and provide them with more choices and greater value. And as we strive to provide easy and comprehensive access to a broader set of financial products and services, we are excited to launch PayPal Savings in the first quarter. Through this expanded partnership with PayPal, we will broaden the distribution of our savings product to reach a unique set of customers with key features and functionality, including instantaneous fund movement between PayPal balances, no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their financial goals. Existing PayPal customers will be able to quickly and easily open their PayPal Savings account inside the new PayPal Super App. We're proud to partner in this transformative initiative and remain intensely focused on continuing to elevate the customer experiences we power across all our partnerships. It should come as no surprise that Synchrony's consistent investment in digital innovation has enabled each of our product and partner successes along our evolution. We are continuously enhancing the ways in which we deliver simple and seamless customer experiences, because the outcomes are far stronger for all of our stakeholders. For example, during the past year, we upgraded close to 11 million accounts across 14 partners to our new alerts platform, which delivers customizable e-mail, text messages and push alerts with real-time and rich transaction data and notifications. We also rolled out some upgrades to SyPI our platform, including several new features like digital wallet provisioning and enhancements to push notifications and e-bill. Collectively, the availability of these features contributed to a 40% increase in unique visitors in 2021 and 56% growth in the number of payments we received in SyPI. With the rollout of enhanced native acquisition capabilities via SyPI and our client mobile apps, we've grown new accounts for that channel by 67% year-over-year. And more specifically, by enabling wallet provisioning for cardholders to add their Synchrony account to their digital wallet, fourth quarter wallet providence grew 32% year-over-year and wallet sales volume increased 63%. So when you put it all together, the unique combination of our deep lending expertise, the industry's most complete product set and our advanced digital capabilities has enabled Synchrony to evolve into a leading financial ecosystem that delivers compelling outcomes for our partners and our customers. There is no other industry provider that offers the full breadth and depth of digitally powered financing products, services and value propositions that Synchrony does today and this ability to connect our partners and customers through best-in-class omnichannel experiences is deeply resonating and driving record results for Synchrony and our stakeholders. In this past year, we achieved almost 25 million new account originations and record purchase volume of $166 billion and a 19% increase in spend per active account. These milestones, combined with strong credit performance and our continued discipline around risk-adjusted returns and expense management, enabled Synchrony to deliver record financial results for the full year, including $4.2 billion of net earnings or $7.34 per diluted share, a 4.5% return on assets and a 39% return on tangible common equity. As a result, we were able to return $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.9 billion of share repurchases and $500 million of regular dividends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the fourth quarter performance, which reflected broad-based momentum across our business. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting our differentiated business model and the strong partner and customer value propositions, which have been made possible as we execute on our strategic priorities. Our net earnings were $813 million or $1.48 per diluted share. We generated a return on average assets of 3.4% and a return on tangible common equity of 28.7%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model, combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our ecosystem. Not only were we able to support the strong seasonal customer-end with our diverse range of products, but we were able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns. We achieved record purchase volume of $47 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 18% compared to both last year and 2019, excluding Walmart. Purchase volume was up double digits across four of our five platforms demonstrating clear broad-based strength through the range of diverse industry verticals we serve. Purchase volume per account also increased during the quarter, up 13% compared to last year and 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding Walmart. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of the purchase volume in the fourth quarter and increased 30% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, including the loans receivable held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 25% of the portfolio and increased 10% from the prior year. Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 20%, totaling more than 7 million new accounts in the fourth quarter and almost 25 million new accounts originated for the year. As you may recall, we reached an agreement for the sale of our GAAP portfolio, which represented $3.9 billion of loan receivables in our held-for-sale portfolio at year-end. Continuing our commitment to achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns, we are discontinuing our partnership with BPAY, which resulted in the reclassification of approximately $500 million of loan receivables to held-for-sale in December. Excluding the impact of our held-for-sale portfolios, loan receivables would have increased by 4% versus the prior year as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate. RSCs were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and 6.15% of average receivables. The $220 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance, including receivables and purchase volume growth as well as the improvement in net interest income. Focusing on our credit performance, provision for credit losses was $561 million. Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve build of $72 million, net of the reserve reductions from our held-for-sale portfolios of $98 million. Excluding the impact of our held-for-sale portfolios, the $170 million reserve build reflected the impact of loan receivable growth within the context of our unchanged set of macroeconomic assumptions and credit normalization outlook, which includes peak loss in the first half of 2023. Other income increased $85 million, driven by a $93 million gain in a venture investment. While I will provide more details later on in our discussion, I want to highlight that the majority of the fourth quarter EPS benefit from this gain was offset by unrelated asset impairments and certain opportunistic marketing investments we executed in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 8 and our platform results, our home and auto, diversified and value, digital and health and wellness platforms each continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong diversified demand. Our lifestyle platform also experienced robust demand as purchase volume increased 6% year-over-year, but faced a tough comparison to last year's strength in powersports volume. Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected the more modest growth versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates. Average active accounts trends range on a platform basis, up by as much as 9% in both diversified and value in digital. Home & Auto, Lifestyle and Health & Wellness average active accounts grew in the low single digits or relatively flat. The average active account growth in diversified value largely reflected the stronger retailer performance. Digital active accounts were up versus the prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base and new programs. Interest of fee trends, while generally improved across the platforms, continue to be impacted by elevated payment rate. I\u2019ll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. The accumulated savings by consumers, combined with seasonally higher holiday transactor behavior, impacted payment rate during the fourth quarter. As we progress through the period, payment rate moderated somewhat from the third quarter levels but increased with the seasonal holiday spend we typically see in December. Payment rate for the period was about 180 basis points higher than last year and 290 basis points higher than our five-year historical average. When tracking the account payment trends from the third to the fourth quarter, we see a slight mix shift away from above and full statement balance payments towards more minimum and below minimum payments. More specifically, the percent of account balance is paying their full saving balance decreased sequentially by approximately 20 basis points and the percent of accounts paying between their minimum payment and their full statement balance decreased sequentially by approximately 70 basis points. The percentage of accounts paying their minimum payment or less than their minimum payment increased sequentially by approximately 90 basis points. We continue to expect payment rate to gradually normalize as customer spend remains robust, the consumer savings read is declining and industry-wide forbearance expires. While it is difficult to predict elevated consumer spending, lower consumer savings, inflationary pressures and return to full financial obligations has begun to impact accumulated savings levels by consumers, which we believe will lead to a moderation in payment rate. Fourth quarter interest and fees were up approximately 2%, reflecting average loan receivable growth. Net interest income increased 5% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period. The net interest margin was 15.77% compared to last year\u2019s margin of 14.64%, a 113 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest-earning assets and favorable interest-bearing liabilities costs. More specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 500 basis points from 79.9% to 84.9%, driven by average receivables growth and lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 96 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.18%, a year-over-year improvement of 51 basis points, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 42 basis point increase in our net interest margin. The loan receivable yield was 19.61%, a year-over-year reduction of 32 basis points. This resulted in a 26 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. Elevated payment rates continue to drive year-over-year improvement in our delinquency metrics. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.62% compared to 3.07% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.17% compared to 1.40% last year. When removing the impact of the held-for-sale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the fourth quarter of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down approximately 60 basis points versus 45 and the 90-plus metric will be down approximately 30 basis points instead of 23. Our portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive strong year-over-year improvement we\u2019ve seen in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.37% compared to 3.16% last year, a 79 basis point improvement. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.76%, down 52 basis points from 11.28% in the third quarter. Let\u2019s move to Slide 11 and focus on expenses. Other expenses of $1.1 billion included the impact of $46 million of asset impairments and $29 million of certain incremental marketing investments. Excluding these impacts, other expenses increased 5% compared to the prior year. Focusing on employee compensation, fourth quarter was impacted by two key factors : one, higher hourly wages as we raised the minimum wage to $20 during the third quarter; and second, higher incentive compensation as 2020 levels were negatively impacted by the pandemic. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 41.1% compared to 37.1% last year. Excluding the impacts of the gain on our venture investment, the asset impairments and the incremental marketing investments, the efficiency ratio would be 39.7%. Even with these adjustments, our efficiency ratio remains elevated compared to our historical average due to lower revenue, which has resulted from the impact of higher paying rate and lower average receivables. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to expense management while also maintaining the pace of strategic investments in the business. This continues to be a clear point of differentiation for Synchrony. As we demonstrated through our Investor Day, Symphony leverages our legacy of operating smaller dollar balances to acquire, originate and service our accounts more efficiently than other general purpose issuers. Our cost to acquire is half that of private label peers and 1/4 of the broader industry\u2019s average. It\u2019s also important to remember that throughout the course of the pandemic, we have maintained a relatively steady level of marketing spend to stay engaged with our customers, much of which is largely contemplated within the RSA. As a result, Synchrony generally does not ramp up our marketing expenses in order to compete for new customers. Similarly, we consistently prioritize investment in our business and technological innovation. The digitally enabled products and services that we offer and the seamless omnichannel experience a power for some of the most sophisticated technology partners in the world would not be possible without our tireless focus and steady investment in innovation year after year. So while the return of our operating efficiency ratio to approximately 32% will primarily be driven by the normalization of payment rate and thus the recovery of revenue, we are confident in our ability to continue to achieve market-leading operating leverage as loan growth continues. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 12 and discuss another core strength of Synchrony\u2019s, our funding, capital and liquidity. Given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021, coupled with the stickiness of our deposit base, we have generally been carrying a higher level of liquidity during the year. While we believe it\u2019s prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during periods of uncertainty, we\u2019ve been actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile. As a result of this strategy, there was a slight shift in our funding mix compared to last year. Our deposits declined by $512 million from last year, and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized funding comprising 10% of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising 9% at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $15.7 billion, which equated to 16.4% of our total assets, down from 24.7% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two primary benefits. First, it delayed the effects of CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter with 15.6% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 30 basis points lower than last year\u2019s level of 15.9%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.5% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.8% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 30 basis points to 17.8% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.4% compared to 27% last year. During the first quarter of 2022, we will recognize the first portion of the CECL transition adjustment, which reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 60 basis points. As a reminder, the impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. This transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics. We continue to execute on our commitment of strong capital return to shareholders by returning $1.1 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through $982 million in share repurchases and $120 million in common stock dividends. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and $500 million in common stock dividends. Given the strong performance of our business during the year, our Board approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization through June 2022 by an incremental $1 billion. As of December 31, we had $1.2 billion remaining in our share for purchase authorization. We have begun our normal capital planning process, and we\u2019ll provide an update to our planned capital actions once approved. Our business generates strong returns and considerable capital, reflecting our commitment to drive consistent growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform and our continued cost discipline. We have considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy either through growth or returns to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to take an aggressive but prudent approach to returning capital to our shareholders, guided by our business performance, market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory considerations. Finally, let me focus on our outlook, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation, assumes a stable to improving macroeconomic environment and a well-controlled pandemic. For the upcoming year, we expect consumer demand to remain robust, supporting broad-based purchase volume growth across the various industries and markets we serve. As consumer savings begins to decline and payment rate moderates, we\u2019d expect purchase volume growth to moderate somewhat. We expect our net interest margin to reflect the trends consistent with those during the second half of 2021 and should follow historical seasonality. With the advance of our held-for-sale portfolios in late Q2, we anticipate some excess liquidity, creating a modest headwind to NIM in both the second and third quarters. And as we\u2019ve done in the past, we will work to reduce this excess liquidity quickly. As payment rates moderate and credit trends normalize through the gradual rise delinquency and loss, we expect higher interest and fee yields to be offset by higher reversals. Our current expectation is that delinquency will peak in the fourth quarter. Given our reserve levels at year-end, we\u2019d expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven and partially offset by the approximate $130 million of final reserve reductions associated with our held-for-sale portfolios. RSA expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth but should begin to moderate as net charge-offs rise. In terms of operating expense, we generally expect quarterly expense to run in line with the fourth quarter 2021 levels, excluding the impact of asset impairments and certain marketing items we discussed earlier. And lastly, with regard to our held-for-sale portfolios, we anticipate conveyance to occur in the second quarter, producing a nonrecurring gain on sale of approximately $130 million. We expect to redeploy this gain through completely offsetting incremental investment in our business, thus the EPS neutral for the full year. So putting it all together, Synchrony\u2019s differentiated model is powering strong growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions, and we\u2019re emerging from the pandemic with considerable momentum. As we continue to leverage our core strengths, our diversified portfolio, which provides resiliency and sustainable growth, our deep industry expertise, advanced data analytics and digitally enabled product suite, the combination of which enables strong risk-adjusted returns and our scalable technology platform, which powers efficient customer acquisition and servicing as well as swift partner integrations. Synchrony will continue to engage more customers, drive greater lifetime value and deliver sustainable growth at peer-leading risk-adjusted returns. So as operating conditions continue to normalize, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the long-term operating metrics we laid out at Investor Day to continue to drive considerable value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his concluding thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. I could not be more proud of the Synchrony team and all that we have achieved this year for our partners, customers and stakeholders. Whether it\u2019s been through investments in our digital innovations, strategic partner integrations, expansion into new distribution channels or the addition of new product offerings, Synchrony has continued to evolve and enhance the ways in which we connect our partners and customers through our financial ecosystem. This has positioned us as a leader in the digital commerce revolution with very exciting opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to win new partners and renew existing ones. And at the same time, we\u2019ll further diversify our programs, products and the markets we operate in. And of course, underpinning it all is our laser-like focus on our integrated product set and providing that best-in-class customer experience that drives value, loyalty and superior outcomes for our partners and customers. Synchrony will continue to outperform over the long term, as we provide our partners and customers with the power of choice. As we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we will continue to drive consistent growth at attractive returns and unlock even greater value for our stakeholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] From KBW, we have Sanjay Sakhrani. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Brian Doubles : Hi, Sanjay. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess have a question for both. Hey, how's it going? A question for both Brian, on loan growth. I know payment rates are sort of weighing against the underlying loan growth expectations. But your long-term targets are sort of high single digits, low double digits. Some of your peers are at their average, if not above their average. Maybe you could talk about what\u2019s driving sort of the weakness relative to your long-term expectations? And \u2013 or do you expect 2022 to get there? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Sanjay, maybe I\u2019ll start and then ask Brian to comment. I would say, look, generally, we feel really good about the operating environment right now. We feel really good about where the consumer is. Last year was a record year in terms of purchase volume on our products. And if you look at that, one of the things that\u2019s really encouraging is if you look at that by demographic, a lot of that is actually driven by Millennials and Gen Z. Sales on our accounts with Millennials and Gen Z were up 42% compared to 2019. And if you look at Baby Boomers, that was up only 6%. So as you think about that mix shift, our products are definitely very attractive to that younger demographic. We also generated 25 million new accounts for the full year. So we actually feel really good about the growth prospects. And as you said, the thing that\u2019s a little bit difficult to call right now is the payment rate. But I think if we see payment rates just normalize a bit, they don\u2019t need to go all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. If they just normalize a little bit here in 2022, we could definitely see loan growth in the high single digits for the full year. I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you\u2019d add anything to that? Brian Doubles : Yes. What I \u2013 the color I\u2019d add, Sanjay, is that when you look across purchase volume across all our segments, we\u2019re seeing strength in all the platforms. So that diversification is pulling through. And I think when there\u2019s a comparison to some of our peers, what gets lost here is the resiliency in our business, right? We do not have as much volume decline as others or asset decline as others last year. So we are being more consistent with that. And listen, I definitely agree. As we entered into 2022, we came off a record purchase volume. I think as we think about the first month of the quarter, we\u2019re seeing a strong mid-teens growth in purchase volume as that continues. And we do see \u2013 and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk later in the call on payment rates, we are seeing some moderation. So I do think you can see that high single digits. And in certain scenarios, we have one scenario that says you can get me in double digits with regard to loan growth. So we feel really good about the model and where we\u2019re entering 2022. Brian Wenzel : The last thing I\u2019ll add, Sanjay, just if you look at that across the platforms, it\u2019s pretty broad-based. Purchase volume digital was up 22%. D&V [ph] up 26%. We got a ton of room to grow in health and wellness, their sales were up 14% in the fourth quarter. So again, pretty broad-based growth, and it\u2019s nice to have turned the corner with all of our platforms having positive receivable growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. That\u2019s wonderful. Maybe another revenue driver you guys sort of talk about the NIM, Brian Wenzel. And I know there\u2019s a lot of liquidity and all this other stuff that affects that metric. But as we think about the yield, I see that last bullet says higher interest and fees offset by higher reversals. Is that one for one? Or do we expect the yield to improve over the course of this year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. The way I would think about it, Sanjay, is as you see the payment rate decline, you\u2019re going to see the yield go up on the book, right? The reversals that come ultimately will be with the charge-offs, which will trail that and it\u2019s not one for one. It never has been. The impact on the NIM this year, it is benefiting from reversals, but not necessarily the key driver behind it. So it trails and it won\u2019t be one for one. Operator : From Credit Suisse, we have Moshe Orenbuch. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Brian Wenzel, I guess, you talked about the normalization of the efficiency ratio. In this environment, investors are paying a lot more attention to expenses and costs. And you said that you\u2019d be driven by the revenue that has been kind of deferred, lost, suppressed. Can you talk about how you think about how large that is an over period of time that comes back? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Great question, Moshe. First of all, I want to start with the expenses. We\u2019re up \u2013 when you strip out the impairment and discrete items that we elected to execute based upon some gains we had in the quarter, our expenses are up 5% year-over-year. And if you think about that, just to start, a lot of it is employee-driven, right. We increased our hourly wage to employees. We also had some onetime adjustments relative to some critical roles in the organization when you think about data scientists, technology, et cetera. So the base in the run rate as we see going forward is pretty stable. And as I said in my prepared remarks, first of all, we don\u2019t have to inject a lot of money into this in order to drive our growth. So the expense base, as we step through each of the quarters, will be relatively consistent. As you think about the efficiency ratio, clearly, the revenue and the yield is lower than we anticipated. So I think over the course of that, call it, the revenue normalization between 2022 and 2023, you will see come back and we see a pathway back to that 32%, 33%. But right now, we\u2019re managing hopefully tightly to the dollar amount as we step through. Again, it\u2019s mainly volume oriented now with more active accounts and higher volume that go through the associations or networks. Moshe Orenbuch : So I guess just to be clear, your cost base is going to be closer to fixed as volume expands and maybe credit normalization causes the RSA to actually benefit revenue over the course of the next several quarters, is that what we should be thinking? Brian Wenzel : I would say on a dollar basis that would generally be true. I think what we\u2019re going to drive is there will be an increase in the variable components of that, but we\u2019ll drive productivity to offset that and keep the expense base relatively flat. So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a shift to be fixed. It\u2019s we\u2019re going to drive productivity and get operating leverage. Moshe Orenbuch : Right. We\u2019re acting like fixed and fixed, yes. I got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Moshe. Have a good day. Operator : From Goldman Sachs, we have Ryan Nash. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Good morning, Kathryn. Brian Wenzel : Hi, Ryan. Brian Doubles : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Brian, maybe as a follow-up to Moshe\u2019s question. If I look at the expense guidance, I adjust for the $75 million. I think it points to about 7% to 8% expense growth. So I just wanted to clarify, for 2022, is the expectation that you\u2019re going to generate positive operating leverage? Can you maybe put some parameters around how to think about expenses relative to the revenue backdrop? And then more specifically, the slides talk about you reinvesting the $130 million from the gain, is that included in the expense outlook? And should we view that as a onetime step up? Or will it remain in the run rate? And I have a follow-up. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So thanks for the question, Ryan. Let me deal with the latter part of your question. The $130 million and any potential offsets we have will not be in the run rate. They will be onetime. So when we actually make those decisions, and that could be a wide ranging effect. That could deal with some of our fixed costs and again, continuing to adjust for the way in which we work. There could be some investments in marketing programs, and we\u2019ll highlight those, but it should not go into the run rate of the business and would be additive to what we have here on the page. I think generally, when you think about the expense base, we are going to generate positive operating leverage, and that\u2019s the way the model was set up. So that as we think about the expenses this year, our view would be that we would have greater growth relative to the assets and the revenue. So we do believe we\u2019re going to get operating leverage. We\u2019re going to manage the positive operating leverage throughout as we step through 2022. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks. And if I can ask a follow-up question. On credit, losses are obviously at very, very low levels. And we\u2019ve seen a little bit of increases in delinquencies and charge-offs. So I was wondering, can you maybe talk about any noticeable trends you\u2019re seeing across the portfolio? Are you seeing any more normalization in the near prime relative to the prime? And then second, Brian, just to clarify, the allowance at 10.76 versus 10% Day 1 CECL, although I recognize that 4Q is seasonally low. You mentioned it being asset driven. So is Day 1 CECL still the eventual destination? And maybe can you just give us some color on how to think about the trajectory of the reserve over time? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So let me \u2013 I\u2019m probably going to give you a longer answer on credit, Ryan, because I do think it\u2019s important to get this background. To specifically answer your question, we have not seen anything discernible in our results, and I\u2019ll explain to you where we come out. But there\u2019s nothing that we see that says this is performing worse than our expectations. I think we understand there\u2019s a lot of concern about what the term credit normalization means and how fast that comes and the ranging damage. I want to give you a framework. First, we talked about, earlier in the call, in my prepared remarks, about the delinquency being 60 basis points better and 30 basis points better than previous periods when you exclude the held for sale. So the delinquency formation of how that will give you lost content for the first half of the year is in great shape. I think, Ryan, when we look at the vintage performances, both on a cumulative basis and a coincident basis and look at it from 2018 forward in these six-month kind of tranche views, each of the vintages from 2018 through 2020 have improved. And we see no deterioration in those vintages as we sit here at the end of 2021. When you look at 2021, both 2020 and 2021 are significantly better than all of the pre-pandemic vintages, significantly better. When we look at 2021 specifically, that\u2019s a little bit worse than 2020 because we took some credit refinements. We don\u2019t believe we have added incremental risk in, but slightly worse performance. But again, significantly better than pre pandemic. I then think you have to think about three other factors, Ryan, as you think about credit. The first is our credit strategy and multiproduct strategy. Our credit strategy is we have a tighter loan grow line strategy. We have tighter account management strategies, which gives us lower severity as you head into this normalization period. So we think we\u2019ll be less volatile, and that\u2019s been demonstrated when you go back and look at the loss curves both in the GFC, recessions and then the pandemic. And then I think when you look at the tools we outlined on Investor Day, the increase in data analytics, the unique sources, the ability to be more surgical, we can control credit as we step through 2022. And then the last thing is the RSA, right? The RSA will ultimately take those charge-offs and our partners will offset that. You combine that with the revenue generation, this would give you a resilient risk-adjusted margin as you kind of step through. So that\u2019s how I think about credit. I think Brian and I and the leadership team are really comfortable with how credit will develop in 2022 into 2023. With regard to your second question on the allowance, we don\u2019t have a differing view that says we\u2019re not going to get back to Day one CECL. It really goes back to what you think your target loss rate is and what your mean loss rate is, and we don\u2019t really have a fundamental view. There will be some portfolio mix that comes into that. But I think we ultimately can migrate back to that assuming that\u2019s the view that we hold, it\u2019s really the timing. And that generally \u2013 if you hold that view, there could be offsets to asset-driven provisioning as we step through 2022. So I apologize for the long answer, but I think a framework for how you think about and talk to your customers. Operator : From Citi, we have Arren Cyganovich. Please go ahead. Arren Cyganovich : Thank you. On the NIM outlook there, I was wondering when you look at the guidance there on the kind of two each levels, which is, I guess, around $15.60, I would have expected that to rise a bit more with the rate increases we\u2019re seeing. How many rate increases do you expect for the year? And what are some of the other aspects that are keeping that somewhat lower? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So with regard to expectations for rate increases, we have three rate increases is our current view. Obviously, the market, I think, depending upon the day, may be different than that. But you got to remember, in our portfolio, less than 50% of our receivables are variable rate. And then when you factor in the transactors, it\u2019s I think less than 30%. So we\u2019re not going to be highly subject to, I\u2019d say, NIM movements. There could be 20, 30 basis points potentially as it relates to NIM. But to be honest with you, it\u2019s not a significant driver. And at the end of the day, we intend to run our book really on a rate neutral scenario. We\u2019re slightly asset sensitive, but not a lot. Arren Cyganovich : Okay. Got it. And then helpful the discussion of our expense base, but a contrary revenue item, the loyalty program cost kind of picked up a decent amount in the fourth quarter, I guess, likely from, I guess, the sales volume you had there. But what\u2019s the outlook on your loyalty program cuts ahead? Brian Doubles : Yes. Great question. Brian and I look at this. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It really means that our customers are engaging with our products and driving volume. So you\u2019re right, it is volume-driven, number one. And you can see that in our dual card volume, our co-branded volume. Our new programs are contributing to some of that rise. And then the final thing is, obviously, value proposition changes where we refresh value props to drive volume factor in there. The other important element that sometimes gets lost is this is a program expense where approximately 80% of this is shared back through the RSA. So we don\u2019t bear the burden. And I think, again, going back to the unique model, we don\u2019t have to inject a lot of marketing to drive growth. We don\u2019t have to inject a lot in the loyalty. And then our partners are sharing both in the marketing expenses and the loyalty. So there\u2019s a natural buffer in the RSA. So again, a lot of it\u2019s offset in RSA, and it\u2019s generally a good thing that rising means our customers are engaging with our products. Operator : From Morgan Stanley, we have Betsy Graseck. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey, thanks so much. A couple of questions here. First on just expenses to tie that up a little bit. I know you\u2019ve got the longer-term guide on expense ratio out there from your Investor Day last year, 32%, 33%. Is that something we should be expecting you would be targeting over the next one year or two? Or is that more like a 2024, 2025 kind of time frame? Brian Doubles : Yes. First of all, good morning, Betsy, I would not consider that a 2022 related metric. We\u2019re in a transitory year relative to the revenue. So I think you begin to look at that when you move into 2023 and how the revenue really develops. Again, we\u2019re going to control the expense dollars. We can control that. The actual output of that has a denominator that\u2019s a little bit less controlled, given the payment rate \u2013 elevation and payment rate. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the other question just on expenses has to do with the investment spend you're making. You've got the $130 million gain and then you're going to be investing that. And from the commentary, it sounds like you're talking about making those investments like during the second, third and fourth quarter next year. Is that a fair read of what you're telling us? Brian Doubles : Yes. So I would look at the investment being primarily in the second and third quarter. That's where we'd like to have it in there to get the leverage effect of it. Obviously, it will depend upon the types of actions. And again, I think there will be a combination of actions that both had tried to reduce the fixed cost of the business as well as incremental investments really to drive the growth side of the business. So Brian and I will review that with the team and set our plans out and hopefully be able to give you an update at our first quarter earnings call in April. Brian Wenzel : It's fair to say we're not going to make any investments that don't have a really good payback or a really good return use of those dollars. Betsy Graseck : Are you talking more about like marketing or investments in the programs as opposed to technology? Is that... Brian Doubles : It's going to be a combination of things. It will be and potentially could be \u2013 we'll look at some of the fixed costs that we have in the business relative to facilities. It could be refreshes of certain programs where we may reissue cards and do things like that, campaigns like that. It could be in technology where we may try to accelerate and continue the acceleration of our digital capability. So it's a combination, but Brian hit on it. We're going to go through a review and the best projects with the best payback and IRs will ultimately win. Brian Wenzel : It's usually two lifts, Betsy that we look at. One is to drive long-term efficiency in the business and the other one is to drive growth, right? Both, let's have great paybacks. We have a really disciplined process around how we evaluate those investments, and we'll obviously run that same play this year. Operator : From Wells Fargo, we have Don Fandetti. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. It seems like the CFPB has been talking a little bit more about cards recently. Can you provide your updated thoughts on the regulatory environment? And secondarily, how is the pipeline for new partners and portfolios? Brian Doubles : Yes. Don, so look, I'd say the regulatory environment has been fairly stable. Obviously, we saw the CFPB's request for information regarding fees. First, I'd just say that we always strive to be very transparent in terms of our disclosures with our consumers. We really don't have a lot of fees other than late fees. As you know, those are already governed and calculated by the CFPB. We're completely compliant with that and their guidance on late fees today. So we'll obviously stay close to that, but nothing more to report really at this point. Brian Wenzel : And then I would say, generally, the pipeline is strong across all five of our platforms, a lot of nice new program opportunities in the pipeline that we're looking at, a lot of opportunities to partner on new distribution channels that we're excited about, so a pretty strong pipeline. I would say there's not a lot of large existing programs out there right now. A lot of them have been locked up, but some really exciting new program opportunities out there. So we're excited about that. Don Fandetti : Thanks Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks. Operator : From Piper Sandler, we have Kevin Barker. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : Thank you and just a follow-up on that question. Your late fees are relatively high compared to the industry just given the amount of accounts you have. So it naturally would be higher. If the CFPB were to do anything or there was any regulatory changes, do you feel like you have the flexibility to adjust your model to continue to generate similar type revenue trends, just given your relationships with other merchants? Brian Wenzel : Well, so just the first thing I would say, I mean, we don't disclose the aggregate amount of late fees, but the late fee dollar amount that we charge on accounts is, again, regulated by the CFPB and very consistent across all of the general purpose card players out there. And look, if something were to change on that front, we could price for it in other ways and protect our revenue and our margin. But look, I think we just got to stay close to this, as I said. And I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything. Brian Doubles : Yes. The way I think about it Kevin, is when we look at it average late fee for incident, and being that we're in the safe harbor with the CFPB, it shouldn't be any real difference between us and I'd say industry participants. I think if you go back historically, under the CARD Act, our revenue when CARD Act changes went into place, essentially remained the same. We went back to partners and we worked that. So I think historically, we've had and run the play where if the environment shifts with regard to how the revenue may or may not be impacted, we'll work with our partners to, again, provide the value to our customers to them and their return an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Operator : From Jefferies, we have John Hecht. John Hecht : Hey, good morning. Thanks very much for talking my questions. Brian Doubles : How are you John? John Hecht : How are you guys? You talked about the RSA, but just thinking \u2013 like RSA, the relationship to rising delinquencies or charge-offs, what's the timing there? And is it kind of basis point for basis point? And then also, how do loyalty program costs kind of influenced the RSA just trying to kind of think about those moving parts within that? Brian Doubles : Sure. So if you think about delinquency John, delinquency should yield higher revolve and higher late fees that flows generally immediately through the RSA. The same things with charge-offs. So when they happen, it goes to media. There's no lag, no delay. Loyalty is the exact same way, it flows through in the period of which have been counted. So to the extent that you see higher interest and fee yield that will flow through, giving upward bias to the RSA charge-offs will give you the downward bias and then either marketing or loyalty depending upon which program expense line comes through, that will also provide immediate downward bias through the RSA. John Hecht : Okay. So in that same time period, we should think about the fluctuation? Brian Doubles : Correct. The only thing that really fundamentally works more on a lag would be reserves, John. John Hecht : Okay. And then follow-up \u2013 second question on a different topic is. You had Clover go into play last year, you developed SetPay, new partners, Venmo, Verizon, maybe can you comment on kind of the contribution this year of those new partners and products? Brian Doubles : Yes. I mean a lot of really exciting growth opportunities in front of us for 2022, John. You hit on a bunch of them. I would say Venmo and Verizon are doing extraordinarily well, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The feedback that I get on the Venmo experience is just off the charts, the feedback that we get on the Verizon value prop and how much you're able to save. And the fact that, that card is definitely acting like a top of wallet card, which is exactly what we intended. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both of those. We also launched Walgreens, as you know, it's still very early there, but I think we've got a customer experience, very integrated, both in-store, online, mobile, et cetera. And then Pay-in-4, obviously, it's still very early, but we've got a really good pipeline of partners that we'll be integrating this year. In addition to individual partner integrations, we're also looking at broader distribution opportunities in health and wellness. We're going to be turning this on in that, in dermatology in the first quarter. We think just given the ticket size there, it's a product that will really resonate. The providers are excited about it. So just a lot to focus on for the team, this is definitely a year of execution. I think we've got the product set that we want. We made a lot of progress on distribution channels and now it's just getting those products out there as much as we can. So they're available to consumers, and we're laser-like focused on the customer experience. I mean at the end of the day, that's what's winning out there, and you just can't invest enough and making sure that you can make it really easy to apply for our products, really easy to service and really easy to buy. So that's where we're focused, but a lot of exciting things for 2022. Operator : From Barclays, we have Mark DeVries. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries : Thank you. A question for you on the credit guidance, there's been a lot of investor focus on just kind of the pace and magnitude of normalization. With that context, I just wanted to clarify, when you say peak expected in Q4 that what you're referring to is just that's kind of your seasonal peak for 2022. It's not your assumption of when you normalize. And if that's the case, how are you kind of thinking about kind of the pace and magnitude of normalization we'll see? Brian Wenzel : First of all good morning, Mark. When you talk about normalization of delinquencies, that really is going to happen kind of post peak of losses, and we've kind of indicated the peak of charge-offs will be in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter of 2023. So it would happen \u2013 normalization happens on delinquencies after that. We expect it to rise. Now I think you have to start out with where we start the year at and how that's going to build, we're at low levels. We haven't seen anything, but it will begin to rise as we step through 2022, which, again, we think is going to be closely aligned with how payment rate will begin to change. If payment rate remains elevated for longer period, delinquencies will be slower to rise. So I think that's \u2013 it's all going to hinge on that payment rate behavior pattern. And I outlined a little bit in our prepared remarks how we see some movement in there. And I think as payment rate has changed, the one thing that we started to notice in some of our cohorts is that on a unit basis, we see migration back for some cohorts of accounts back to 2019 levels. What's happening is that we have another cohort of accounts that have increased spending and increased payments. And so on a dollar basis at the top of the house, it looks like payment rate is not slowing down for certain pieces. For some pieces of our portfolio, it is clearly migrating back to 2018. When that happens more in total for the portfolio, you'll see delinquency trends, I think, move with it. Mark DeVries : Okay. Great. And just on the pace of normalization. If you think about kind of the macro assumptions that you made about a stable to improving macro and it contained pandemic, kind of how are you thinking about \u2013 without economic stress, how quickly delinquencies could normalize? Brian Wenzel : Well, typically, vintages take about 18 months to begin to season from a delinquency perspective. So again, being that we started some credit refinements in the first quarter this year, you would begin to see some of that flowing through in the latter part of this year, so the third or fourth quarter, mainly the fourth. So you'll begin to see that absent any changes in the macroeconomic environment. Just the simple fact that we've unwinding things and begun to induce what we would call smart growth with regard to some of our CLIs and upgrade activities inside our dual cards and private label book. Operator : We have time for one final question from Wolfe Research, we have Bill Carcache. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Hi, good morning. Brian Doubles, I believe you said that even if payment rates normalize just a little bit, you could see high single-digit loan growth. Can you give a little bit more color on mean by a little bit? Could that be 50% of 2019 levels? And Brian Wenzel, you said there's a scenario where loan growth could be double digit. Could you expand a little bit more on what that scenario looks like? Brian Doubles : Yes. So look, Bill, I would say we certainly don't need payment rates to come all the way back to pre-pandemic levels to post high-single-digit loan growth. I mean a modest improvement and just a slight reversion to the mean. And I'm not going to give you basis points here, but would put us in that high-single-digits for the full year, I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that? Brian Wenzel : Yes. What I'd say, Bill, is our planning process this year, we had multiple scenarios that we ran and we ran it on varying degrees of how the payment rate evolves. So there is a scenario where the payment rate slows down quicker. And in that scenario, given the timing lag on purchase line, you will see potentially under that scenario a higher rate of growth when it comes to loan receivables. So it really is going to hinge-off of, I think the important part is what is that payment rate doing and the trend of the payment rate throughout the entire portfolio as we step through 2022, which will give you the range of outcomes. But again, when we're printing a mid-teens type of purchase volume growth, it doesn't take a lot on the payment rate in order to impact the sequential loan growth that we're seeing. Brian Doubles : And Brian hit on this earlier. I mean, we are seeing some positive developments in terms of the payment rate in terms of fewer people paying in full. And so I think there's some indication that there will be some reversion to the mean in 2022. It's hard to call exactly when and how much. But again, if you look at the purchase volume across the platforms, we feel really good, closing out a record year last year and as you look across all platforms we see broad-based growth in purchase volume. And we did have every one of our platforms in the fourth quarter, had positive receivables growth. So it's a pretty good setup as you look to 2022. Bill Carcache : Yes, that's really helpful. I guess expanding on some of your earlier comments and sort of thinking about the interplay between that normalization in payment rates and credit, are you at all concerned over the risk of credit normalizing faster than payment rates and alternatively, based on what you're seeing in credit? Could there actually an opposite scenario where receivables growth leads credit on the normalization side? Brian Doubles : Absolutely to the latter part, we could see loan growth going faster than credit normalization. It may be able to say. They're more likely than not, they're going to move in sync. We do not generally see a scenario where credit normalization happens and you have elevated payment rates, the way we have. That would be highly unusual and probably not something we've ever seen before. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded.  And I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, and you may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.  During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I'll now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2022, including net earnings of $932 million or $1.77 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4% and a return on tangible common equity of 34.9%. This financial performance was driven by the core strengths of our business and the continued execution of our key strategic priorities to drive greater value for our partners, providers and customers. We continue to expand and diversify our portfolio during the first quarter with the addition of renewal of more than 15 partners. We also continue to extend our reach and engage more customers, thanks to the powerful combination of our seamless experiences, attractive value propositions and broad suite of flexible financing options. New accounts grew 10% during the first quarter, reaching $5.5 million, and average active accounts increased 6%. Turning to customer spend. We continue to experience broad-based demand across the many industries we serve. Purchase volume increased 17% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in our diversified value, digital, health and wellness and home and auto platforms. We also continue to see higher engagement across our portfolio as purchase volume per account grew 10% compared to last year.  Customer spend reflected strong cross-generational growth. Millennial and Gen Z spend increased 23% year-over-year, and Gen X and baby boomers spend increased 15%. The combination of strong purchase volume and a slight moderation in payment rate drove loan receivables growth of 8% on a core basis.  Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased 29% from the prior year. On a loan receivables basis, including the loan receivables held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 25% of the portfolio and increased 16% from the prior year.  In short, Synchrony has continued to see strong engagement across our customer base and momentum across our product suite, thanks to our ability to deliver flexible financing options that specifically address whatever our customers' transactions may look like on any given day, whether they're looking to cover a health care need, purchase supplies for a home repair, or they're simply convenience or value shopping. Our customers can access financing solutions that specifically address their needs while optimizing the value they seek. Of course, in an ever-changing consumer landscape, the financing needs and expectations of customers evolve as do the strategic priorities of our partners. To an increasingly greater degree, it's no longer simply about reward points or cash back. It's also about delivering an end-to-end experience or the kind of perks that attract a customer to the product, are designed to anticipate and optimize value. The more dynamic and data-driven those experience and the value propositions are, the deeper the customer relationship and the stronger their lifetime value over time. In order to deliver consistent and compelling outcomes for both our customers and partners, we consistently invest in our digital capabilities, our product suite and our value propositions so that we can continue to meet our customers where, when and however they want to be met. These investments take shape in a number of different ways, whether it's through loyalty, technology or marketing spend, our partners' interests are aligned with ours. So we structured the majority of our economic arrangements such that the investment and upside opportunity are shared.  Synchrony's innovative digital capabilities allow us to deeply integrate with our partners and providers to deliver seamless and engaging omnichannel experiences, while also leveraging our data and insights to optimize customer outcomes. In particular, we are often able to develop highly tailored value propositions to attract customers for whom we can predict transaction behavior and financing needs, which ultimately leads to more engaged and satisfied customers, higher spend and better outcomes for all. We are always looking for ways to enhance our program performance. Value proposition refreshes are particularly attractive and effective way to drive deeper engagement with existing customers and attract new customers, resulting in higher lifetime value of each account. We have far more data and insights to leverage based on our experience with an existing portfolio. And since our partners' interests are aligned with ours, the investment costs are generally shared. Simple program enhancements like deeper integrations, more relevant and universal value propositions and greater product flexibility enable us to deliver greater and more utility and value to our customers and stronger results for our partners. Our customers receive greater financial flexibility to address their broad range of needs and make smarter purchases, while also maximizing the rewards they care about. And our partners attract new customers and drive greater customer loyalty, larger ticket sizes and more frequent transactions. Our partnership with PayPal is a great example of how, together, we continue to evolve and enhance our offerings to drive still greater outcomes for all. Earlier this month, we announced the launch of our new and refreshed co-branded PayPal Cashback credit card. The consumer value proposition is a best-in-class cash-back offering where the consumer will earn unlimited 3% cash back when paying with PayPal at checkout and 2% everywhere else, Mastercard is accepted. The card has no annual fee, no category restrictions and can be added to the digital wallet for easy, fast and secure checkout.  We're excited about this opportunity as it delivers exceptional consumer value while leveraging the innovative digital experiences from previously launched partner programs to deliver a truly seamless and elegant customer experience. In particular, the PayPal card experience will be fully integrated with the PayPal app empowered by native APIs. Customers will be able to apply for the card and service their accounts all within the app as well as receive personalized notifications and alerts to manage their credit account. Thanks to our integration within the PayPal app, customers will be able to redeem their rewards into their PayPal balance to use for future purchases or transfer into their PayPal savings account powered by Synchrony Bank. The rollout of the new product, enhanced experience and value proposition began earlier this month, and we expect it to be fully deployed this quarter. Given the level of integration and functionality we are launching with this card, as well as the best-in-class value proposition we're delivering, we expect to see meaningful growth in new accounts and spend on the card. We're truly excited to continue to raise the bar by consistently investing in and delivering innovative financing experiences for our partners and customers.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the first quarter financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance reflected continued strength across our diversified sales platforms and, in particular, the powerful combination of our digitally powered product suite, seamless customer experiences and compelling value propositions, which resonate deeply with the needs of our customers and partners. We generated over $40 billion of purchase volume in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a 17% increase compared to last year. From a platform perspective, our home and auto, diversified value, digital and health and wellness platforms each continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong demand for both our products and attractive partner and provider networks. At the platform level, home and auto purchase volume was 10% higher due to continued strength in home and improvement in auto as more consumers return to the road. In diversified and value, purchase volume increased 25% and driven by strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement. The 20% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer engagement, including higher active accounts and higher spend per active among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches. The 17% increase in health and wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based strength led by dental given the benefit of increases in patient volume compared to the prior year. Our lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of 4%, reflecting strong retailer sales and growth in music and specialty, partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory shortages in power and particularly strong growth in the prior year period. Loans grew 8% year-over-year to $83 billion, including loan receivables of $78.9 million and held for sale receivables of $4 billion. At the platform level, year-over-year loan growth rates accelerated from the fourth quarter as strong purchase volume and some easing in payment rates contributed to balance growth.  Net interest income increased 10% to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting a 7% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables. On a sequential basis, first quarter payment rate was down approximately 25 basis points to 18.1%, but was still approximately 45 basis points higher than last year and approximately 225 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average. As we progress through the first quarter, payment rate declined to 17.2% in February, but increased in March, reflecting normal seasonality associated with the tax refund season. That said, March was the first month where payment rate was lower versus the prior year since the pandemic began in 2020. Net interest margin was 15.8% in the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 182 basis points. The primary driver of this NIM expansion was a 6.5% increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interest-earning assets due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity. This accounted for 126 basis points of the year-over-year increase in our net interest margin. In addition, the first quarter's 32 basis points improvement in loan yield and a 33 basis points reduction in interest-bearing liabilities cost each contributed 26 basis points of NIM improvement. RSAs were $1.1 million in the first quarter and 5.4% of average receivables. The $150 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs. Provision for credit losses was $521 million, an increase of 56% versus last year due to lower reserve release that was partially offset by lower net charge-offs in the first quarter 2022. Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve release of $37 million, inclusive of the reserve reductions from our held-for-sale portfolios of $29 million.  Excluding the impact of our held-for-sales portfolios, the $8 million reserve release reflected an improvement in our loss forecast and credit normalization trends based on continued strong performance, partially offset by an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Other income decreased $23 million, primarily reflecting higher loyalty costs due to purchase volume growth. The year-over-year comparison was also adversely impacted by lower investment gains from our ventures portfolio. Other expenses increased 11% to $1 million due to the impact of higher employee, marketing and business development and technology costs. Other expense also included the impact of $10 million related to certain employee and legal matters. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 37.2% compared to 36.1% last year. In total, Synchrony generated net earnings of $932 million or $1.77 per diluted share during the first quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 4% and return on tangible common equity of 34.9%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model, combined with the compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem. Not only were we able to support our strong customer demand with a diverse range of products, but we're able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 9. Elevated payment rates continue to drive year-over-year improvement in our delinquency metrics. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.78% compared to 2.83% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.30% compared to 1.52% last year. When removing the impact of the held-for-sale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down about 15 basis points versus 5, and the 90-plus metric would be down about 30 basis points instead of 22.  Our portfolio's strong delinquency trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvement in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.73% compared to 3.62% last year, an 89-basis-point improvement year-over-year, primarily reflecting a very healthy consumer and a 45-basis-point higher payment rate. The 36-basis-point sequential increase from our fourth quarter net charge-off rate of 2.37% primarily reflected the impact of approximately 25-basis-point sequential decline in the payment rate as some consumers continued to revert back towards pre-pandemic payment behaviors. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.96%, up 20 basis points from the 10.76% in the fourth quarter. Let's focus on some key trends that have supported our strong performance, and the confidence we have in our business. First, as we just discussed, the underlying trends within our portfolio are performing better than our expectations heading into the year. Our portfolio payment trends continue to show gradual normalization across the credit spectrum, reflecting the strength of the consumer more broadly.  In addition, the population of customers within our portfolio that are now in post-exploration forbearance programs from other lenders has performed better than our expectations. This suggests to us that with the benefit of excess savings due to stimulus, modified spending behaviors and widespread forbearance, these borrowers manage their personal balance sheet well through the pandemic, and therefore, have a lower probability of default. According to data from [Chernis], 2/3 of consumers have either only spent a portion of the stimulus or have the entire amount of stimulus they receive still saved. The remaining 1/3 of consumers have spent the entirety of the cash stimulus they received during the last 2 years. When tracking consumer balance trends by tiers, zero to $2,500, $2,500 to $5,000 and balances greater than $5,000, the [Chernis] data indicates that while all balanced tiers of stimulus-receiving customers have seen balance declines between $200 to $300 from peak levels observed last fall, the 2 higher tiers continue to show growth in their savings balances since the third stimulus check. The lower tier with balances of $2,500 or less has generally remained flat aside from the stimulus checks over the last 2 years. Meanwhile, labor markets continue to be robust as unemployment levels decline and wage growth continues. Through mid-April, consumer spending continues to be strong, reflecting broad-based spend across our platforms and products. Finally, our portfolio is well positioned to navigate changing market conditions given its inherent diversification across bank categories, financing options and channels and customer demographics. Synchrony's sales platforms encompass a broader range of discretionary and non-discretionary industry through a wide network of distribution channels.  More than a quarter of our purchase volume in 2022 came from each of our diversified value, home and auto and digital platforms. Another 8% of purchase volume came from health and wellness. And almost half of our wealth spend in 2022 was comprised of bill pay, discount store, drugstore, health care, grocery and non-grocery food and auto and gas spend. In addition, our disciplined approach to driving consistent growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns means that our portfolio credit mix remains balanced and favorably positioned compared to the mix in the first quarter of 2020. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, approximately 40% of our balances representing super prime customers, another 35% came from prime and the remaining 25% came from non-prime. And in terms of average credit line by credit segment, our portfolio's super prime, prime and nonprime lines are still lower by an average of 8% compared to 2 years ago. Moving on to another Synchrony strength, our funding, capital and liquidity. Deposits at the end of the first quarter were $63.6 billion, an increase of $814 million compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.8 billion. This resulted in deposits being 83% of our funding compared to 81% last year, with securitized funding comprising 8% of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising 9% at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $17.8 billion, which equated to 18.7% of our total assets, down from 29.2% last year.  As a reminder, before I provide the details of our capital position, it should be noted we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. This transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics. To that end, the first-year phasing of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital resulted in a reduction of our CET1 ratio of approximately 60 basis points in the first quarter. We ended the quarter at 15.0% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 240 basis points below last year's level of 17.4%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.9% under the CECL transition rules compared to 18.3% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 250 basis points to 17.2%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.5% compared to 28.7% last year. We continue our track record of robust capital returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through $967 million of share repurchases and $114 million of common stock dividends.  Even when factoring in the roughly 180 basis points of remaining CECL transition impacts on our capital ratios over the next 3 years, synchrony still has considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy in order to get to our 11% CET1 target ratio. This, coupled with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business, thanks to our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns means that Synchrony is particularly well positioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions, and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions. As part of our capital plan, the Board has approved a 5% increase in our common dividend, bringing it to $0.23 per share beginning in the third quarter 2022. In addition, our Board has approved an incremental share repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion for the period ending June 2023. Inclusive of the remaining $251 million authorization we had at March 31, this brings our total share repurchase authorization to $3.1 million. Finally, let's turn to our updated outlook for the full year, which is summarized on Slide 12 of our presentation. We've assumed that the pandemic remains well controlled that any rising cases will not have a material impact on the economy or our customers. Our macroeconomic scenarios include a minimum of 5 interest rate increases during 2022, qualitative tightening measures starting in the second quarter, a slowing economy resulting from these actions and continued higher inflationary conditions. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain, given the dynamics of the portfolio as we see them today, we do not anticipate a material impact on our full year 2022 outlook for loan receivables and credit performance. We expect consumer demand to remain robust, supporting broad-based purchase volume growth across the various industries and markets we serve.  As consumer savings begin to decline and payment rate moderates, while on a lag, we would expect purchase volume growth to moderate as the year progresses. Given the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth we've achieved, we expect ending loan receivables growth of approximately 10% versus the prior year. To the extent that payment rate moderates further, we would anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan growth to accelerate. We expect our net interest margin to be between 15.25% and 15.50% for the full year. As we move through the year, NIM will be impacted by the fluctuation in the percentage average loan receivables to average earning assets due to the impacts of seasonal growth, portfolio conveyances and the timing of funding. As mentioned earlier, our NIM outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as rising interest and fees, which will be partially offset by higher reversal as credit normalizes. In terms of credit performance, we expect a rise in delinquency and loss from current levels. For the full year 2022, we expect net charge-offs to be less than 3.50%. Based on the performance we've seen across the portfolio, we now expect the portfolio to reach our mean annual loss rate of 5.5% until 2024, unless significant changes in the macroeconomic environment develop. Of course, as credit normalization continues to take shape, we expect interest and fee yields to increase. As charge-offs peak, this growth in interest and fees will be partially offset by peak reversals. We expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven.  RSA expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth, but should begin to moderate as net charge-offs rise. For the full year, we expect the RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables to be between 5.25% and 5.50%. As a reminder, we anticipate the GAAP and BP portfolio conveyances to occur in the second quarter, producing a nonrecurring gain on the of approximately $130 million. We expect to completely offset this gain through increased investments or incurring certain discrete items and thus be EPS neutral for the full year. Included in this quarter was $10 million of certain employee and legal matters, leaving approximately $120 million of the incremental costs remaining for the full year. In terms of other expense, we continue to expect the quarter levels to be approximately $1.05 billion. This outlook excludes the impact of the $130 million gain on sale we are reinvesting or incurring in our business. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage. To the extent that receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year, we will moderate our spending where appropriate, while still prioritizing the best long-term prospects for our business. An example of such an opportunity might be through fewer workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spend. So to conclude, Synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we progress through 2022. We're confident in our business' ability to deliver sustainable, attractive risk-adjusted growth even if the market conditions change. Our innovative customer experiences, compelling value propositions and flexible product offerings are resonating across the diverse industries, partners and customer demographics we serve. Our sophisticated cycle-tested underwriting as well as our deep domain experience of lending and servicing at scale, meaning that the predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities will continue to support the stability of Synchrony's target loss range. Finally, our RSA functions as an economic buffer. As interest and fees rise with credit normalization and receivables growth, the RSA absorbed the impact of both rising net charge-offs and a large proportion of any increases in growth-oriented costs. These factors enable Synchrony to deliver consistent results with peer leading range of risk-adjusted returns over time. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. we deeply understand the needs and expectations of our customers and partners, which enables us to deliver financing solutions and experiences that strongly resonate building long-lasting relationships and greater value over time. Synchrony's differentiated business model consistently positions us as the partner of choice. Whether we're powering financing experiences for local merchants, health care providers, our national brands, we're able to meet our customers where, when and however they want to be met. The scalability of our technology platform, the breadth of our product suite and the depth of our lending insights across many industries enables us to consistently deliver sustainable and attractive outcomes for all of our stakeholders.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And from Credit Suisse, we have Moshe Orenbuch. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. And Brian, I wanted to kind of just follow-up on the net interest margin guidance. Obviously, on a year-over-year basis, there's a big change in the mix of earning assets. And you kind of alluded to the fact that, that might be normalizing. So is there a way to relate the 10-ish percent growth in loans to growth in net interest income in dollars? In other words, how much of that expected decline from current levels and the margin is more about asset mix than it is about other factors? Brian Wenzel : Yes, so I would expect -- and I think the way Brian and I and the leadership team are managing the business is that we would like to see asset growth come through in NII, right? So the biggest wildcard then afterwards would be the interest expense piece. So we would expect that from a dollar basis, it would track at least on the top line revenue. And then again, I highlighted a little bit of the timing relative to some of the funding cost changes that we'll have in place. And you're right, one of the bigger wildcards will be ALR as a percent of average earning assets, which was at a little bit higher mark than we usually run at 85% during the first quarter, usually runs 1 point or 2 lower than that. So -- but again, it should track on a dollar basis, at least on the revenue side, back to asset growth. Operator : Next, we have, Ryan Nash. Ryan Nash : So, Brian, the credit outlook, both near and intermediate term seems more upbeat and I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about what you're seeing in the underlying portfolio that led to the better credit outlook. And the outlook from unemployment to remain pretty strong here, just maybe outside of a recession, can you just talk about what you see as the drivers of normalization? And are you seeing any impact from inflation on your customer spending habits? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you. Thanks, Ryan. So first, when you think about credit, the biggest thing for us as we entered the year was the large portion of our book of customers who had received forbearance and other institutions. And how that -- how those customers would play out of forbearance. Again, we look back to the performance we had for folks that were on forbearance with us -- we obviously understood who do not have forbearance with us and then you look at this population of people. As we looked over the last 4 months, the performance of that was significantly better than our expectation. So we watch that develop. We also watch how our vintage post the refinements we made beginning of last year developed. And we became more confident that we would not see what I would call a faster credit normalization, which reflected in a slower glide back to our mean loss rate out in 2024. So that's really how credits developed. Again, as we sit here in the first couple of weeks in April, we haven't seen anything that would most certainly change that view. I'll go to your last point about inflation and the customer. The customer is really starting at a point of strength. They absolutely have excess liquidity, and we demonstrated that or at least indicated that with higher savings rates. Our credit delinquency and how it sits today, average balances, all are in great shape when they have it, and you have low unemployment. So we look at the customer today. When you look at purchase behavior pattern, we see small evidences of inflation inside of our book, but not really significant. So if you looked at a category like gasoline, our average transaction value on gasoline is up 22% year-over-year. So you clearly see the effect of inflation there. But in some respects, we don't see other parts of inflation. So look at grocery, grocery, for us, average transaction value is flat year-over-year, flat sequentially every month during the quarter, but frequency is up a little bit. So that tells you the consumers being able to manage their spend within that -- inside that category. We see a little bit in apparel, but the rest, we have not seen any dramatic impact from inflation as we move forward. And to address your middle point unemployment, again, we look at unemployment. It's obviously stronger than we had anticipated entering the year. It continues to remain strong. There's more jobs that are outstanding. I think most certainly with continued strength in the unemployment market, we obviously believe that the credit forecast we put out both for this year and for next year will remain intact. Operator : Next, we have Betsy Graseck. Betsy Graseck : Could you unpack a little bit the loan growth acceleration that you got in digital? And help us understand how much of that is coming from the new cards you have out there, PayPal Verizon, et cetera, the new offerings, the refreshed offerings on PayPal and other drivers of that and contrast it with the home and auto, which may be decelerated a bit? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Betsy. I'll start on that. I'd say, look, generally, digital is a platform that we clearly expect to outpace the rest of the business in terms of growth rate. We're definitely seeing that. A big chunk of that is obviously attributed to Venmo and Verizon. Both of those programs continue to perform really well. I still believe those will be top 10 programs for us in the future. We're getting great both qualitative as well as quantitative feedback on both in terms of the experience, the val prop, et cetera. there's really nothing inside the digital numbers this quarter for the PayPal launch. That just happened, but we're really excited about that as well. I think that's going to be a terrific offering. It's really, really 2 parts.  First, the valve prop, we think is best-in-class. It's going to be a top-of-wallet card for folks. And then I would say the other thing that we did is we really launched probably our most sophisticated technology stack in terms of how we're integrating inside of the PayPal app. So the experience is really fantastic. So again, I think digital will continue to outpace the rest of the business. Brian Wenzel : Yes. I think just to add on, Betsy, for the home and auto piece, when you look at that platform, auto is clearly improving. It came off of a low last year. So that's obviously a positive trend. With regard to inside home, there's a little bit of continued softness in the furniture portion of home, which, again, is a little bit more of the inventory backlog clearing out. Again, we bill when furniture is delivered. So we expect that to continue to be a headwind here for the next quarter or 2, hopefully, as the inventory and supply chain is clear out. Brian Doubles : I think this is also the benefit of having a really diversified business. We're seeing really strong growth in digital, really strong growth in health and wellness, and that's a little bit immune in terms of impact from supply chain and other things if you think about health and wellness and the backlog that those providers are working through. So again, I think it speaks to the benefit of having a very diversified portfolio. Operator : We have Sanjay Sakhrani. Sanjay Sakhrani : Obviously, the drumbeat on macro weakness is increasing since we last spoke. And I know Brian Wenzel, you talked about all the statistics that make you comfortable on the state of the consumer. I'm just thinking about the reserve posture. You guys are pretty well above sort of where you were CECL day 1. Maybe you could just talk about how you accounted for the macro environment at the time CECL day 1 was said and then where we are today because at some point, we're going to migrate back down to CECL day 1 if losses remain well below those levels, correct? Brian Wenzel : So the way I would think about our reserve position today versus CECL adoption, again, our mean loss rate has not changed from that 5.5% target. So at the end of the day, it's really the loss forecast that gets you in that reasonable supportable period and then potentially any overlays. So I think when you look at it today for us, if you're solely to look at the macroeconomic conditions, Sanjay, it would tell you that your coverage ratio will be down versus day 1, right? One of the things that we still have is qualitative overlays, both for some of us relief that we talked about as well as we have some macroeconomic uncertainty as it relates to Ukraine and the higher inflationary environment that kind of -- is keeping the reserve slightly higher than the day 1. Again, I think where we sit today is we will ultimately migrate back to that day 1. Well, certainly, I think the inflationary pressures and the global geopolitical uncertainty clears, and that reserve build here in the coming months would really be more growth-oriented. So again, we -- absent mix, we still view is we're going to migrate back to that day 1 CECL rate. But again, we're trying to account for some of the uncertainties that exist in the marketplace. And we're ready for our next call, Brandon. Operator : We have John Hecht. John Hecht : We have -- he I guess 1 question -- any discussions with the partner pipeline or any major partnership renewals as we go through this year? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I would say we've got a very strong pipeline across all 5 of the platforms. if I look at it, today, it tends to skew a little bit more towards start-up programs and opportunities like that as well as, I would say, distribution partnerships and opportunities as well for our products. There isn't as much out there with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 that are large existing programs, but we'll obviously get a look at those as well as they come up in the next year or 2. And then I think for us, we're actively renewing our programs. We don't have anything significant of size coming up in the next few years. But we're always in discussions with our partners about what kind of changes can we make to drive even better performance? Can we do that in the context of a renewal? So our teams are actively working those opportunities where they exist. But generally, I feel like we've got a pretty good pipeline, and we're well positioned. We're also getting a lot of good getting a lot of good traction on the product suite and I think the benefits of having an integrated product suite. So as we're out there competing, I think that's a real differentiator for us, too. Operator : From Wells Fargo, we have Don Fandetti. Don Fandetti : On the PayPal cash back card refresh, I guess my question is -- do you expect the same amount of revolve to drop? Or do you expect that to be a little more transactor. And I guess, Brian Doubles, do you feel like the integration here is pretty deep. Does that make the relationship stickier in terms of sort of renewal-type risk longer term? Brian Doubles : Yes. So look, I'd start by saying we're really excited about the launch of the new value proposition and the new experience inside of the app. I think it's going to be a game changer. PayPal is excited about it so are we. I would tell you that these opportunities that we have to relaunch a val prop, it does drive a lot of traffic, a lot of new accounts, a lot of spend. And I think with a val prop like this, it will definitely be a top-of-wallet card. We had a good val prop before, but this is incremental. So we're really excited about it. And I would tell you on your integration question, Don, absolutely. I think that our goal is for our integration to be absolutely seamless to the customer. And we started doing this years ago with SyPi. Now we're leveraging our API stacks, and I can tell you when you're inside the PayPal app, the Venmo app, you don't know what was something that was developed by PayPal or something that was developed by Synchrony. It's just completely seamless. You never know. You never have to step outside of the app. You never get kicked to a website. It's 100% integrated and completely seamless. So that's our goal. We don't necessarily focus on how does that impact the renewal down the road, we're really focused on just how do we deliver the absolute best experience we can for a PayPal customer, a Venmo customer, et cetera. So we're very excited to have this launched and look forward to seeing how it does. Operator : We have Mihir Bhatia. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to just go back to payment rates for a second. You saw a pretty big moderation in March. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about that. I guess, what made the payment rates go from up 140 basis points year-over-year or down 50 basis points. The reason, I guess, I've got March is that's when we started seeing a lot more conversation around inflation, higher gas prices starting to have an impact. So was that a consumer thing? Was it as you expected? Is there something else about the year-over-year comp we should be keeping in mind? Anything there? Brian Wenzel : Yes. First of all, thank you, Mihir, for the question. So again, there is a little bit of timing related to tax refunds that plays out. So clearly, there was some faster refunds that were paid out in February versus March. If you look at the overall tax refund season, right? Your average refund is ahead of last year, I want to say 13%, the dollars are probably [$14 billion]. So we think that had probably a little bit of a disproportional effect in February. We also think as we watch consumer behavior patterns, we've indicated to you, we have seen portions of the portfolios and cohorts that have decelerated payment rates beginning in the latter part of 2021, and that has continued into 2022. When we look at it, I know we get a lot of questions with regard to credit grades inside of that. Are you seeing any 1 particular place inside the portfolio? If I look at March alone, so just March alone, the deceleration in the payment rate happened across all credit grades. So it was not at the lower end. It actually the largest percentage of deceleration happened in the prime segment. So it's not a subprime issue relative to inflation. And I think when you also look at the -- again, we also talked quite a bit about people under payment statement balances, their minimum payments or the middle. We've obviously seen the folks in the middle decline, but go as equally up into the full pace is down into a minimum pace. So again, it really says this is across the board, and we don't necessarily think it's inflation-driven, but part of, I think, the migration that we anticipated back on payment rate back to the mean that we anticipate the exact time of which we're not 100% sure of, but again, we're starting to see that turn. So thank you, Mihir. Operator : We have Rich Shane. Rich Shane : When we look at the operating expenses and talk about the incremental reinvestments in 2022, I'm curious, should we see that as a run rate? Or should we see the $120 million that you have remaining through the rest of the year sort of onetime or incremental as we think about going -- numbers going forward? Brian Wenzel : Great. Great. Thanks for the question. It will be onetime expenses. We had the $10 million in the first quarter, they're related to some employee-related reductions. I think as you step into the second quarter, again, we'll detail this out, you'll see some further reductions in some of our physical footprint and structural costs inside the business. You will see some incremental dollars that are put into marketing to really accelerate growth, and that will be onetime in nature. So I would not anticipate it to be an ongoing expense. Again, what we're trying to do is take the onetime gain, really reinvest it back into the business either to reduce structural costs or accelerate growth. So it should be a net 0 for this year and not comp into next year, but hopefully help the growth. Operator : We have Kevin Barker. Kevin Barker : I would like to go back to your comments about NIM and the expectations for deposit costs. Deposit costs and you are -- are higher in the previous rate cycle versus today, but your balance sheet is much more deposit funded than it was previously. So it seems like, structurally, you should have a slightly better liability structure in this rate cycle. I was hoping maybe you can just dig a little deeper on your expectations for deposit betas in this cycle versus the previous cycle, and your expectations for overall funding cost, just given the uncertainty around rates and inflation? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Great question. So when we look back to the kind of previous cycle and previous rate increases, again, we were really growing our deposit book, which we started back in the, call it, the early 2010 to 2015 range. So we are accelerating growth in the bank. And given the fact that we were a newly separated company, there was some higher costs that were embedded in there. I think you are right. We have shifted from probably mid-70s percent deposit composition of the funding stack to at least low 80s, now mid-80s, potentially with -- I think we're 83% this quarter. So that is going to provide a benefit. There's going to be some rotation. I think as you see interest rates rise here, a lot of folks have gone into savings versus CDs. In the short run, that could have some negative impact. Over the long run, getting people lock into CDs in this environment is a better alternative for us. So we can -- we look at that as being over the long term, a good thing if I can get people into term-related savings products. I think when you think about betas, if you look where we are so far to date with the first 25-basis-point movement, less than half of that, if you call it that, has already manifested itself in our high-yield savings rates. Depending upon the tenor, essentially, it's been 100%, but we've really been trying to raise deposits because our growth rate of being targeted at that approximately 10%, we want to get ahead of some of the funding-related matters. So it's going to be a little bit around what competition does in the marketplace. But again, it could be slightly higher than previous cycles. But again, people have been slower to react so far into the environment. And again, I think the higher deposit mix will be very beneficial for us as we think about NIM moving forward. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] Unidentified Analyst : So I guess, on Slide 12, you guys mentioned the annual loss rate won't hit the mean until 2024, unless significant macro changes. Can you sort of just quantify what comprises some of these changes? I just sort of wanted to get a sense on how you're thinking about downside scenarios? Brian Wenzel : Yes. When you think about our loss rate, the biggest variable that drives loss in the recession or any other environment is unemployment. And what's going to be different, I think, as people think about the macroeconomic backdrop is that you're coming from incredibly low unemployment, and you really have built up savings in the prime and super prime segment. So when you traditionally think about a credit normalization or an increase in your loss expectations, it's driven off of unemployment, number 1.  And then, 2, in that prime segment, it really goes into people that struggle that have higher exposure at the fall. So I think as we look at it going forward, because you have such low unemployment, you have more jobs than you have today, up until now, albeit not necessarily offsetting inflation, a rising hourly wage, that buffer some of the unemployment pressure that you would see in the loss rate. And the excess savings that you have would buffer some of the loss content that you'd see in the prime segment. That's what gives us probably greater comfort that there's more of a glide even in a slightly difficult scenario. The scenario where macroeconomics change is you do have a rapid rise in unemployment, and you have a very fast depletion and savings rates in the prime customers could dictate a higher loss rate over that horizon. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] Unidentified Analyst : On the payment rate expectation, I know you flagged the decline that you saw in March, which is encouraging. Can you maybe talk about your confidence in sustainable decline there on the payment rate front? And then on the flip side, I appreciate the color you gave on the delinquencies and at least some of the progression on credit by customer segmentation, are you seeing any stress at all in the lower income bands that's noteworthy here because we're hearing about some payment issues at the lower income at other payment providers out there. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Let me deal with your latter question with regard to the lower credit. We are not seeing -- as you would refer to our pressure, we see normalization that's happened on payment rate as on entry rate delinquency flows, but not pressure. So I know there are other subprime issuers out there they have pressure. They have been more aggressive, really going out during the, I call it the middle part of the pandemic to open the origination of credit box for them. We obviously didn't do that. So we're not seeing incremental pressure. We're seeing more, what I would say, normalization back to a pre-pandemic level related to the -- related to that lower credit quality. With regard to payment rate, and this is something we monitor closely, we monitor in lots of different ways, credit rate is 1. We look at different aspects inside of it. We look at who's paying, call it, statement balances, [NIM] pays between that. Again, we're following a trend. It appears to be moving in the right direction. The exact slope here, we have to get through the tax return season here, which will be April, and then we'll begin to see now the consumer continues to react. Again, they are spending very healthily across the credit -- across the industry, right? Relative to credit cards. So purchase volume strength will most certainly help bring the payment rate back in line with mean averages. So there's nothing that we see that's stressed. There's nothing that we see that there's indicative of a change in direction relative to the slope of the performance. Next question, Brandon. Operator : Arren Cyganovich, please go ahead. Arren Cyganovich : The loan growth guide is a bit above your kind of long-term expectation. Can you just talk a little bit about -- is that more payment rate? Is it more kind of acceleration in terms of customer activity? Or is it still a bit of a catch-up from some of the pandemic related maybe on the health care side? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I would say maybe just to take a step back, I'd say, generally, we feel pretty good about the operating environment as we look at it here for the balance of the year. We were talking about high single digits earlier this year, I think we feel better than that's going to be in that kind of 10%-plus range. We're not relying on an enormous amount of payment rate moderation in that. It really is more top line purchase volume driven. We just had our highest first quarter ever in terms of sales on our products. So we're seeing really good growth across the portfolio. We had growth rates on receivables in the 5 platforms anywhere from 6% to 12%. So it's broad-based. It's not 1 platform that's really driving that. It really is across the business. So we feel like, at least for the balance of the year, the consumer is strong. As Brian said, 2/3 of them saved at least a portion of, if not all of the stimulus. So we're seeing that come through in purchase volume. We're seeing it in the credit metrics. So like I said, we feel pretty good about the environment right now, and it really is driving what we're seeing on the growth side and it's not necessarily a reversion to the mean on payment rate. Operator : [Operator Instructions] From Autonomous Research, we have Brian Foran. Brian Foran : I guess as you think about the outlook for the consumer and how you feed that through managing the business, it's tricky, right? Because you've been very clear. Everything you're seeing recently is better than budgeted. Consumers in great shape. One of the narratives in the market is the Feds got a jack rates to 3% plus, and it's got to get unemployment up to tame inflation. And it's kind of like all going to play out over the next 6 months or so, but we really won't know the impact until next year. And so I guess the spirit of the question is like, as you think through your underwriting and your marketing this year, I know you're always making changes and always trying to be thoughtful and proactive. Is there any scenario where like you're tightening underwriting even though your book is doing great because of that forward Fed risk? Or how you think about meeting that unusual interest rate risk through the book and through your marketing plans as we move through the year? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, generally, I would say, Brian, we're going through a period of extraordinarily strong performance as it pertains to credit. I mean we've never seen delinquencies and loss rates where they are. This -- we don't underwrite to these levels. They're about half of what we would consider a target NCO rate. And so what I would tell you, we're not tightening an expectation of what's going to happen in 3 and 4 because we didn't take this opportunity to go a lot deeper, right? We're not underwriting to today's environment, whether it's how we're underwriting the consumer, how we're underwriting new programs? We're looking at this kind of an over time mean loss rate, and that's what we're underwriting to. So one of the things that we've talked about in the past, it's really important in our business is when times are extraordinarily good, we don't necessarily go a lot deeper. We try and maintain our discipline.  And we look at the value of whether it's a customer or a program agreement, we look at that over a number of years and assume that, over that time period, you're going to have some reversion to the mean. And that's really the discipline that we have around our underwriting model. Again, whether you're looking at consumers or new programs and how we're pricing those, we try and factor in what we think is going to happen over the next few years and not take advantage of the extraordinarily good period that we're operating in right now.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the Company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony continued to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver strong financial results for the second quarter 2022, including net earnings of $804 million or $1.60 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 3.4% and a return on tangible common equity of 30.3%. These results were driven by Synchrony's differentiated business model and our deep understanding of the needs and expectations of our customers and partners. Consumer health also remained strong during the second quarter, which supported continued demand for the wide variety of products and services that our partners, merchants and providers offer. As a result, Synchrony added 6 million new accounts, grew average active accounts by 4% and achieved our highest purchase volume ever in a quarter of $47 billion, a year-over-year increase of 12%, or a 16% increase on a core basis. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 38% of core purchase volume and increased 31% from the prior year. Consumer spend was broad-based across our platforms, leading to double-digit growth in our diversified value, health and wellness, digital and home and auto platforms as well as single-digit growth in our lifestyle platform. We also continue to see higher engagement across our portfolio as purchase volume per account grew by 8% compared to last year. The continued strength in purchase volume contributed to loan receivables growth of 5% year-over-year or 11% on a core basis. Our dual and co-branded cards accounted for 22% of core receivables and increased 27% from the prior year. We also continue to extend our reach and engage more customers, thanks to our ability to deliver our seamless experiences, attractive value propositions and broad suite of flexible financing options across our ever-growing network of distribution channels. To that end, we recently announced the launch of Synchrony SetPay pay in 4 through Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale and business management platform. This buy now, pay later offering further expands the suite of payment and financing options and will be part of the Pay with Synchrony app on the Clover app market for merchants. Through our partnership, Synchrony is able to expand our customer reach and distribution through hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country. Synchrony's long-term partnership with AdventHealth, one of the largest not-for-profit health care providers in the U.S., is another example of how we continue to expand and deepen our reach in health and wellness. AdventHealth will offer CareCredit as its primary patient financing option, and will accept CareCredit nationwide in more than 130 facilities, including hospitals, urgent care centers, outpatient clinics and physician practices. As out-of-pocket health expenses continue to rise for consumers, Synchrony's CareCredit is a way for people to pay for care not covered by insurance, including deductibles, coinsurance and co-pays. CareCredit's flexible financing options will be available for all points of care and within the patient's AdventHealth account, which includes Epic MyChart portal, enabling patients to manage their care needs alongside side the resulting financial obligations. In addition to extending options for consumers to pay for care, CareCredit will also help streamline the health systems' payment processes. In short, Synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customer is looking to make a payment or finance a purchase, big or small, in person or digitally, we can meet them whenever and however they want to be met, with a broad range of products and services to meet their needs in any given moment. This ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries and retailers and providers alike, is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow, particularly as customer needs change and market conditions evolve. We have one of the largest active account bases in the U.S. with more than 65 million active accounts. And yet, our typical customer has less than two of our products on average. As we continue to expand our distribution channels and more effectively leverage our various marketplaces and networks, Synchrony can connect our partners with more customers and derive still greater lifetime value expansion. Say, for example, our home and auto care networks, where combined annual visits surpassed 300 million last year. And CareCredit.com, which received almost 19 million provider views in 2021 as well as 19 health systems across the country and our strategic partnerships with point-of-sale platforms like Clover. No matter how you look at it, Synchrony is increasingly delivering the power of our networks on behalf of both our customers and our partners. Whether it's through the expansion of our existing customer wallet share or increasing our reach to new customers, we are driving efficient and sustainable growth because of our increasingly ubiquitous presence and the universal utility of our offering. From revolving lines like our private label, dual and co-branded cards to our broad range of installment offerings and secured and commercial products, Synchrony's financial ecosystem can deliver the right financing offer for the right product at the right time, all while optimizing the value they see. And of course, this is all enabled by our dynamic technology stack. Synchrony has prioritized innovation for many years and have the digital capabilities to facilitate deep integrations with sophisticated partners as well as simple functionality for smaller local businesses. We can be as plug-and-play or as customized as necessary without increasing our level of investment. As Synchrony leverages our proprietary data, analytics and underwriting through these integrations, we deliver not only seamless experiences, but also consistently powerful outcomes for both our customers and partners. The breadth and depth of our consumer lending expertise informs every aspect of our customer and partner strategies and allows us to support them and provide a great experience. The level of continuity that Synchrony provides across channels, spend categories and partners as well as through business and market changes, drives both loyalty and resilience for Synchrony and our stakeholders, from partners with digital omni presence across spend categories and point of sale and merchants that offer great value across discretionary and non-discretionary needs to providers like doctors and dentists and major health systems like AdventHealth and St. Luke's and practice management software like Epic, synchrony is increasingly at the center of a broad range of financing needs empowering our customers with choice and best-in-class value propositions that truly make a difference. This drives greater diversity and resilience in our portfolio, both in terms of our sales platforms and the industries we serve as well as consumer spend categories. Our customers finance everyday purchases like gas, groceries and routine medical expenses as well as more episodic needs, like buying a new mattress or replacing a refrigerator. They derive great value from our general purpose and dual and co-brand cards, coupled with the best-in-class rewards they can earn on their spend. About half of our out-of-partner spend is comprised of non-discretionary spend like bill pay, discount store, drugstore, health care, grocery and auto and gas. And of course, Synchrony also derives resilience from our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Our sophisticated data analytics and our proprietary underwriting have enabled Synchrony to reach more customers and offer them greater financial flexibility, while also maintaining or improving upon the predicted level of risk. In fact, since 2009, Synchrony has more than doubled our purchase volume, receivables and interest income, while also growing our mix of prime and super prime customers by 14 percentage points. Meanwhile, we built a very strong balance sheet, including a stable deposit base that represents more than 80% of our funding at any given time, consistent and efficient access to the debt capital markets and a robust capital and liquidity position such that we currently operate with 15% CET1 ratio at 25% Tier 1 and credit reserve ratio. So, when you bring it all together, Synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient risk-adjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and our partners evolve. We leverage our proprietary data and analytics, diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack to maintain low customer acquisition costs, deliver consistent credit performance and drive greater customer lifetime value. We align our partners' interest with our own through retail share arrangements, which are designed to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions, while also sharing program profitability with our partners. And we utilize a stable and efficient funding model to provide continuity to our customers and partners when they need it most. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the second quarter financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another strong financial performance for the second quarter, highlighting the benefits of our highly diversified business across our sales platforms, our partners, merchants, providers and customers and underpinned by the continued health of the consumer. This quarter, we achieved the highest quarterly purchase volume as a company, exceeding $47 billion, which reflected a 12% increase compared to last year. On a core basis, which excludes the impact of our recently sold portfolios in the prior and current year quarters, purchase volume grew 60% year-over-year. From a platform perspective, our diversified and value, health and wellness, digital, and home and auto platforms each continue to generate double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong demand for the variety of goods and services we finance, as well as the broad partner, merchant and provider networks that connect our customers and partners. At the platform level, home and auto purchase volume was 12% higher due to continued strength in home as well as higher auto-related spend, reflecting the waning effects from the pandemic period, the preference for consumers to invest in the maintenance of their existing vehicles given the supply chain issues on new and used vehicle sales and the impact of inflationary pressures on gasoline purchases and automotive parts. In diversified value, purchase volume increased 24%, driven by the strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement. The 14% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer engagement, including higher average active accounts and spend per active among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches. The 15% increase in health and wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account driven by our dental, pet and cosmetic categories. Our lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of 2%, reflecting strong retailer sales and growth in our music, specialty and luxury verticals, partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory shortages in our outdoor vertical and particularly strong growth in the prior year period. Loan receivables grew 5% year-over-year to $82.7 billion or 11% on a core basis. We also continue to see sequential growth driven by strong purchase volume and partially offset by higher payment levels. Net interest income increased 15% to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the 13% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables. Payment rate for the second quarter, when normalizing for the impact of the portfolio sold during Q2, was 18.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than last year, approximately 250 basis points higher than our historical average. The net interest margin was 15.60% in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 182 basis points. The primary driver of our NIM expansion was a 570-basis-point increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interest-earning assets, primarily due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity. This accounted for 105 basis points of the year-over-year increase in our net interest margin. In addition, the second quarter's 80-basis-point improvement in loan yield contributed to a 63-basis-point improvement in net interest margin, while the slight increase in interest-bearing liability costs reduced net interest margin by 1 basis point. RSAs were $1.1 billion in the second quarter and 5.42% of average receivables. The $121 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs and also included an approximate $10 million impact associated with our reinvestment of the gain on sale from portfolios sold during the second quarter. The reinvestment was in support of the growth initiatives in association with the value proposition launch. As a reminder, the RSA is designed to create mutual alignment of interest. While each agreement is unique to the partner program, we generally structure the majority of our economic arrangements such that the investment and upside opportunities are shared. So as Slide 7 demonstrates, the RSA enables our partners to sharing the profitability of our programs, while also providing economic protection to our business. In a rising credit loss environment, the level of RSA payment to our partner declines because the higher credit costs become a larger offset to the program's profitability. In addition, the minimum profitability threshold within each RSA ensures that Synchrony achieves an appropriate risk-adjusted return before any economics are shared with the partner. These minimum return thresholds also provide a buffer to our business in the occasional event of a regulatory change such that the profitability of the program performance is impacted by, for example, a change in fees collected. This dynamic also was demonstrated on Slide 7 due to the strength of our risk-adjusted return when the CARD Act became effective in 2011. Given the questions regarding the potential changes to late fee regulation, I thought I'd highlight two things. First, over 60% of our late revenue flows through our RSA agreements and will be subject to sharing with our partners. Second, greater than 95% of the late fees are covered through either repricing rights or change in law provisions, effectively change in regulation provisions, which were included in our program agreements adopted after the CARD Act was implemented. This is another example of how the RSA function has alignment of interest with our partners as market conditions change. Next, let's focus on provision for credit losses, which was $724 million for the quarter, a year-over-year increase due to the impact of a reserve release last year and partially offset by lower net charge-offs. Other income increased $109 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the $120 million gain on sale from the portfolio sold during the quarter. Excluding the impacts of the gain and certain reinvestments of the portion of the proceeds, other income would have been 3% lower year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher loyalty costs that were partially offset by interchange revenue year-over-year. Other expenses increased 14% to $1.1 billion due to the impact of higher employee costs marketing spend, information processing and other expenses. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 37.7% compared to 39.6% last year. Excluding the effects of the reinvestment expenses deployed from the gain and sale proceeds, the efficiency ratio would have been 36.8%, an approximate 280-basis-point improvement. The increase in employee costs versus last year reflected higher headcount driven by growth and in-sourcing as well as higher hourly wages and other compensation adjustments. Total other expenses included $62 million of costs related to additional marketing and site strategy actions as we reinvest the $120 million gain on sale through these and other growth and efficiency initiatives. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, we expect that the gain on sale and reinvestment in Q2 and the remainder of this year will net out as EPS neutral on a full year basis. In summary, Synchrony generated net earnings of $804 million or $1.60 per diluted share for the second quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 3.4% and a return on tangible common equity of 30.3%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally-enabled model, combined with the compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem. Not only were we able to support the strong customer demand with a diverse range of products, but we're able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. At a macro level, we continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the credit spectrum of the portfolio. That said, even with this normalization, our 2021 and 2020 vintages continue to perform better than our 2019 vintages and payment rates remain elevated versus last year as well as compared to our historical average. With regard to delinquency, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.74% compared to 2.11% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.22% compared to 1% last year. The year-over-year delinquency comparisons were primarily impacted by the prior year period's historic lows, at which point, the impacts of COVID-19 stimulus and forbearance action had the greatest impact on the portfolio. Our portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvement in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.73% compared to 3.57% last year, an 84-basis-point improvement year-over-year, primarily reflecting the very strong consumer. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.65%, down 31 basis points from the 10.96% in the first quarter. Let's focus on some key trends that continue to support our strong performance and confidence we have in our business. First, the consumer remains in a strong position. The combination of robust labor markets, wage growth and elevated savings continues to support the desire to spend and repay their financial obligations, while also managing through the impacts of the inflationary pressures. According to external data, stimulus spending segments have generally remained consistent from March through June. About 2/3 of consumers have either spent a portion of their stimulus or have the entire amount of stimulus they receive still saved. The remaining 1/3 of consumers has spent the entirety of the cash they received during the last two years. When taking a look across the balance tiers, the top two tiers of the stimulus recipients, those with balances above $2,500, have seen modest balance decreases, while the lower tier balances less than $2,500, have remained flat. During the second quarter, consumers rotated their spend within discretionary and non-discretionary categories as they manage higher costs from inflationary pressures while still fulfilling their everyday purchases. In general, we saw a slight variability across our out-of-partner spend volume and frequency trends. These fluctuations likely indicate that the consumer is not actively reducing total spend or frequency, but rather rotating their overall spend. So for example, in certain categories like grocery, it appears that our customer is managing to ticket size and substituting items that are a greater priority, whether that means choosing a generic brand or forgoing a less desired item or treat. In terms of gas station spend, however, average transaction values have accelerated with rising gas prices, but transaction frequency has generally held constant, if not increased slightly. All this is to say, we continue to see trends of a strong consumer who is moving through their day-to-day and spending money without meaningfully changing their choices or priorities. Second, the differentiated strength of our business as well as the underlying trends within our portfolio that we have discussed today continued to demonstrate Synchrony's ability to deliver market conditions. In addition to the inherent resilience that comes from the diversification of our portfolio across spend categories, financing options, distribution channels and customer demographics Synchrony derives financial strength through our sophisticated cycle-tested underwriting. The predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities supports more stable loss performance around our target peer loss range of 5.5% to 6% even as economic conditions change and consumer creditworthiness evolves. From 2009 peak loss rate of 10.7% during the great financial crisis, the last decade's average of approximately 4.5% loss level our portfolio has grown and evolved meaningfully. And even as the mix of partners and credit quality of our portfolio has shifted over that same decade, Synchrony has grown significantly and delivered resilient risk-adjusted returns within a band of 8.5% to 11%. It's also important to note that we've delivered these returns even as interest and fees have been coming at somewhat lower levels due to the elevated pay rates during the last two years. Moving on to another synchronous strength, our funding, capital and liquidity. Synchrony's balance sheet has been built to be resilient. Over time, we have diversified our business in support of our ability to generate consistent risk-adjusted returns and considerable capital. This, in turn, has allowed us to grow and evolve our balance sheet such that we can fund growth efficiently without having to make trade-offs with regard to what's in the best long-term interest of our business and our various stakeholders. Let's start with the strong and stable foundation of Synchrony's funding, our deposit base. Deposits at the end of the second quarter reached $64.7 billion, an increase of $4.9 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 84% of our funding compared to 81% last year, with both securitized and unsecured funding each comprising 8% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $18.9 billion, which equated to 19.8% of our total assets, down from 23% last year. As a reminder, before I provide the details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. The annual transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics. We ended the quarter at 15.2% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 260 basis points lower than last year's level of 17.8%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.1% of the CECL transition rules compared to 18.7% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 270 basis points to 17.4%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased in basis decreased to 25% compared to 28% last year. We continue to deliver robust capital returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned $809 million to shareholders through $701 million of share repurchases and $108 million of common stock dividends. When considering our existing capital position today, combined with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business, Synchrony is particularly well positioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $2.4 billion. Finally, let's review our full year outlook, which is summarized on Slide 14 of our presentation and incorporates the following macroeconomic assumptions : 10 interest rate increases during 2022, qualitative tightening measures, a slowing economy resulting from these actions, continued higher inflationary conditions and no additional impacts from the pandemic. We continue to anticipate broad-based strength and purchase volume. As consumer savings declines and payment rate moderates, while on a lag, we also expect purchase volume growth to moderate. Given the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth we've achieved in the first half of this year, we expect ending loan receivables to grow in excess of 10% versus the prior year. To the extent that payment rate moderates further, we would anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan receivable growth to accelerate. We expect our net the full year. As we move through the back half, net interest margin will be modestly lower due to the impacts of seasonal funding to support growth. Our net interest margin outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as the increase in interest and fees driven by the primary movement in payment rate moderation. Higher interest and fees will be partially offset by the impact of reversals as credit normalizes and the impact of benchmark rates on funding. To that end, we now expect net charge-offs of approximately 3.15% for the full year, reflecting the strong credit performance we experienced in the first half. As we move through the second half of the year, we continue to expect delinquency to rise modestly. We continue to expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven absent a meaningful change in the macroeconomic environment. RSA expense will continue to reflect the impact of strong program performance and robust purchase volume growth, but should continue to moderate as net charge-offs rise. We now expect RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to be approximately 5.25% for the full year. In terms of other expense, we continue to expect quarterly levels to be approximately $1.05 billion. This outlook excludes the impact of the $120 million gain on sale that we are reinvesting in our business this year. As a reminder, we deployed $80 million of the gain on sale proceeds in 2Q and expect to deploy the remaining $35 million to $40 million in the second half, such that the gain in reinvestments will be EPS neutral for the full year. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage. To the extent that our receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year, we will moderate our spending where appropriate, while still prioritizing the best long-term investments. Examples of such is the opportunity might be to lower the workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spending. So to conclude, Synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we progress through 2022. We are confident in our business' ability to continue to deliver sustainable, attractive risk-adjusted growth and resilient peer-leading range of risk-adjusted returns, even if market conditions change. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Very few consumer financing providers in the market today have Synchrony's unique combination of broad customer base and wide range of partners and providers, diverse product suite and deep distribution channels, innovative technology capabilities and robust funding capital and liquidity. Synchrony's core strengths enable us to consistently and efficiently connect our customers and our partners and provide continuity through high-quality outcomes including the right financing product at the right time with attractive value propositions and a best-in-class experience for our customers, incremental customers with stronger lifetime value for our partners, and sustainable growth and consistently strong risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So Brian, maybe can impact the net interest margin guidance a bit. I think you said 10 hikes, which is a little below the market. And I guess, is the change in guidance reflective of the outperformance or any other drivers? And maybe can you just talk about the deposit pricing strategy from here given the pace of hike? And what's included in for betas in terms of the updated margin guidance? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I'll try to unpack that question in pieces. So the first is, when we look at our reserve modeling and how we think about the back half, we use 10. We're probably at 13 now. As we said in the past, we are generally interest rate insensitive. We're $1.4 billion liability sensitive now. So the fact that the rates kind of come through does not have a big impact on our business and really shouldn't reflect or shouldn't really impact our net interest margin in the back half of the year, number one. As you think about deposit betas, this has been an interesting topic. And I think people are looking back really to the last cycle quite a bit with regard to the betas. And I think the important part is to understand for us as our issuer specific book, we do have a bigger shift between savings and CDs. The duration is down a little bit from what used to be 11 months to five. But we're 57%, 60% savings now. When you look at the rate starts -- where the rates were at the start of the cycle, they are much higher than what they were at the start of this cycle. So beta is a little bit higher. It's competitive. We're going to continue to move with the market, but we have a lot of growth to fund in the back half of the year. So the deposit betas will be slightly higher than the past cycle, but clearly manageable. I think as we think in margin in the back half of this year, the real key is going to be how much liquidity we have in our average earning -- interest-earning assets. So we expect that whatever the interest-bearing liability cost increase will be largely offset with higher interest of fee income. So that will be almost, I'll call it neutral, so to speak, in the back half. And then you're just going to feel the effects as we move into the third quarter to prefund growth for the fourth quarter that will cause what I would call a normal seasonal decline in margin as we move forward. Ryan Nash : Got it. And if I can ask a follow-up maybe for both of you. So the reserve today is at 10.65%, still above day one CECL despite obviously very low losses. I know this partially is hard to answer, but, can you maybe just help us understand how you think about reserve building in a modest downturn maybe relative to past cycles? And can you maybe just talk about how you think about the relationship between rising unemployment and losses in a recession just given the strong liquidity position that Brian Doubles had outlined that consumers are in, in the prepared remarks? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Let me take that, Ryan. So I think -- if you were to think about where we are from a delinquency standpoint, our reserve just on a modeled basis, right, a pure model would probably be lower than day one today. So I know a lot of folks are sitting around saying, well, you're approaching day one. Given the credit performance, you would argue that probably would have been lower than day one if we're back in that period of time. I think, as we move forward, we're going to see the relationship that you normally see between unemployment and charge-offs will hold for a little bit. But I think given where it is, how low it is, given the high amount of savings, similar to what we saw both back in '20 and back in the GFC, you'll probably break correlation between unemployment and net charge-off rate. So I think it's important to watch that, but it's cost going to be poor in the actions we take. I think as people think about the path to normalization, I think some people are underestimating we're at such a low rate now. We have the ability to take actions to control the charge-off to the extent the macroeconomic environment deteriorates quickly. That's very different than if we were at our mean net charge-off rate. So we would anticipate reserves as we move forward to mainly be growth driven, and we hopefully will be able to manage if the macroeconomic deteriorates inside of what we think that mean loss rate is. Brian Doubles : Yes. I think, Ryan, just expand on that a little bit. We've been pleasantly surprised all year by the strength of the consumer. We're running at below half of our target loss rate in the business. So to Brian's point, we've got a lot of room to move, and we'll have plenty of time to move if we need to, if we start to forecast a worsening macroeconomic scenario as we head into '23. But the consumer from all aspects, whether you look at spend, whether you look at credit, at this point in time, is still really strong. I think they've got the excess savings. I think 2/3 of customers either saved a portion or all of the stimulus. So that's going to take a few quarters to burn through, and we'll -- we're looking at this every day. And if we think -- as we move into '23, I think we feel really good about how we're positioned for the balance of this year. But as we move into '23, if we need to make some modifications to kind of keep us within our target loss rate, we'll absolutely do that. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : And Brian Doubles, you talked a little bit about offering of additional products to existing customers. Maybe I was hoping you could kind of expand on that a little bit. Maybe talk about how you could do that? What areas of the portfolio you think are best kind of situated for that? And maybe what that could add to your growth rate over the intermediate term? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Moshe. I think this is one of the most exciting things that we're working on, frankly, is this multiproduct suite and these offerings for our partners. And one of the things that's changed really over the last -- I would say, over the last six months is partners, in our discussions with them, they realize that there's an opportunity for them to rationalize and be a little more thoughtful about their point of sale and the products that they offer to their customers. And this is where we think we actually have a big advantage in that. We've got a very robust product suite, whether it's a paying for a longer-term installment, private label, co-branded dual card. We think of it almost like a menu where we can go into a partner and say, \"Look, this is what we have. These are the products that we think fit your customer based on their purchases and their spend patterns.\" And they're pretty excited about that. And I think that the benefit also for us is we can do that in a way where we're earning a very attractive return. And at the same point, we should be able to reduce costs for our partners. And so I would just tell you, there's a lot of engagement, both big partners as well as small to midsized partners. And the other big part of this that we don't spend enough time talking about is just the integration model. And I think this is a big differentiator for us as well. So as you know, we have big partners. We have small partners and providers in health and wellness. And they have, I would say, different needs in terms of how we integrate with them. So we'll have a big partner that is very interested in a robust, full API technology stack integration so it's seamless within their app, Venmo is a good example of that, all the way down to the small dentists, who needs something very simple where the customer can just apply while they're sitting in the waiting room. And we can offer that spectrum of integration solutions. That's a really big deal because the one thing that we've seen, which is really important right now is the technology resources that sit inside of our partners, whether big or small, they don't have the bandwidth, frankly, and we need to make it super easy for them to integrate our products, our solutions, give them access to those financing options. Clover is another great example. That's -- we just announced we're opening up SetPay pay in 4 inside of our app, which sits on the Clover platform. That's a really big deal because that allows us to build something once and distribute it to thousands of partners all at the same time. So, as you think about our strategy to take a step back, you really have to think about it as having a very comprehensive product suite to meet the needs of very different and diverse partners. But then also, what are your integration strategies, and how do you make that seamless and easy for the partner base. So again, one of the most exciting things that we're working on across the business right now. Moshe Orenbuch : Perfect. And just as a follow-up. From a credit standpoint, as you started the year, there was some caution, I guess. You had some caution about how some of your customers, who had been, let's say, received deferments elsewhere, might perform. And obviously, that concern has kind of burned through. Could you just talk a little bit about -- and you mentioned a lot about the state of the liquidity of your customers. What are you looking at to kind of gauge their health at this stage? I mean what are the key things that you would look at and say, \"Wow, that's -- now that's better or where we're seeing that normalization continue?\" Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So, I think when we think about the consumer today, you're right, the ones that received forbearance was ones we tracked very early on in the year. We continue to watch very closely the population of people who are still on student loan forbearance. So, we\u2019re tracking that population of people as they move through. From a performance standpoint, we look at a couple of different things. We obviously look at how a spending behavior pattern changes. We drill in from a credit standpoint. We drill into payment behavior pattern increases and watch who is paying statement pay, who's paying the minimum pay, who's paying between those two and see if we see any dramatic shifts that are occurring inside those populations. And we look at that relative to credit grade. And again, we have not seen any real signs of a broad-based deterioration. Certain cohorts have migrated back to 2019-ish pandemic levels, but we have not seen broad-based deterioration. That goes into the low unemployment. That goes into hourly wages. That goes into increased savings. So, there's a lot of things that are still in there. So, we're watching a lot with regard to spending and behavioral patterns that are in there. And again, population of people is really -- I think the student loans are the ones that are the greatest interest to us right now. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Brian Doubles, wanted to just dig in a little bit on the credit quality of the book. You mentioned during your prepared remarks about how the portfolio has been skewing to prime, super prime and wanted to get your sense as to how you're thinking about that project over the next year or so, maybe even just a couple of quarters if you want? I'm wondering if you're anticipating that with the new programs that will continue and how that is at all ameliorated by the increase in the near prime, subprime portfolio, increasing their borrowing as inflation continues to kick in here. Just wondering how you think that trajects. Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I'll start and ask Brian to comment. Look, I think the portfolio has never been in better shape than it is right now, no matter how you look at it. You look at the delinquencies, the loss rate at roughly half of what we would target in this kind of environment, coupled with the fact that we've seen this really strong migration, which has been intentional over time to skew more prime and less subprime. And I think we're not contemplating anything as we move into the back half of this year into '23 that would change that profile. We feel, again, really good about the operating environment right now. if you remember, going back, when losses started to reach these all-time lows, we didn't take the opportunity to open up on underwriting. If anything, what we did was we kind of dialed back some of the cuts that we made or modifications that we made in the beginning of the pandemic, but we stayed very disciplined. And there were clearly opportunities where we could have went deeper where we could have put our foot on the gas. But we knew that we were in this window where the consumer was really strong here benefiting from the stimulus, but we didn't take that opportunity to go a lot deeper. In fact, we maintained our discipline. And that's how we're going to continue to run the business through the back half of the year and into '23. And so, I wouldn't envision a big shift in that prime, near prime mix. I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything. Brian Wenzel : Yes. The two things I'd probably add is, one, origination of new accounts today under-indexes into non-prime. So, I think from that standpoint, to echo Brian's comments, we're not line in their lines continue to be lower in the non-prime segment than pre-pandemic levels. I do think over the course of time, you will see the non-prime migrate up a little bit as you continue to see the unwind of score migration that happened during the pandemic. And as balances return back to more normalized level, but that's not really underwriting-driven. That's really a reversal of the trend that you saw during the pandemic. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then on the follow-up, this is a really nitty gritty little question, so sorry for the question. But on Page 14 in the guide, on credit normalization, you're saying that DQs -- credit normalization will continue with DQs rising modestly in 2H'22. And I think in the last deck, you used the word slow rise. So, what am I supposed to take from that? Like modestly and flower, I seem to me to be the same type of message, but maybe I'm wrong there. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Betsy, first of all, we do appreciate all questions, even if they are nitty gritty. So what I tip back and say you're going to see monetize. It's not changing perspective with regard -- credit has over performed in the first half of the year, which means the starting point in the back half is a little bit differently, but we don't see a drastically different trajectory from where we are here through the end of the year. Credit will be better for the entire year than when we sat here 90 days ago and most certainly six months ago. But we feel really good about credit as we move through the back half of the year, and we feel good how that sets us up. To be honest with you, in '23, even given the uncertain macroeconomic background. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Back to the reserve, your comment that the reserves build from here should be more asset-driven. Does that mean that you think a stable reserve ratio is likely for the near term? And then also from a CECL perspective, I know you indicated in your broader economic guidance, the expected economy to slow. So even from a CECL perspective, wouldn't that warrant some credit-related reserve build as the economic scenarios that you factor in worsened? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. So the way we look at the model, obviously, we have the base credit model that looks at the delinquency formation today and how that rolls out to loss over our reasonable supportable period. We have done a number of overlays on there, which are more stressful with regard to how the consumer will evolve and have the macroeconomic situation of use. So I think with those overlays, you get to a point where we have what I would call an elevated reserve relative to day one CECL and where the portfolio sits today absent that. So I think as you think about moving forward in the environment to the extent that an adverse situation, an adverse macroeconomic situation develops, those overlays, in theory, become embedded into the core reserve model, and therefore, you have growth-driven reserve here over the near term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess first question is on the obviously, you guys expect it to now be at the low end of the prior guidance. I'm just curious what's driving that. I was a little surprised because the loss rate also is expected to be lower and that usually the two kind of work in inverse ways. So maybe you could just talk about that, Brian Wenzel? Brian Wenzel : Yes. You have two different dynamics. You have, obviously, some of the operating favorability that you have coming through, there is mix that comes through here as well as gap coming out of the portfolio that brings you back down that operated at a slightly higher RSA percent, all that brings you down to the lower end of the range. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And so going forward, we should expect it to be more correlated to the various operating metrics, given gaps out? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Yes, it should correlate to it. We also -- back on Page 7 of the deck, we also -- one of the things that I know people are trying to model RSAs in a way that they can be more predictable. I think we showed a metric here, which is RSA relative to purchase volume. Because remember, there is a significant portion of the RSAs that is volume oriented that tends to be a more stable metric. I think you can look at it quarter-over-quarter seasonality and I think will help people as they try to build their models as they go through it. Again, we do believe that we're going to migrate back to that 4% to 4.5% level as net charge-offs normalize and as the revenue, interest of the revenue and yield normalizes as well. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. And my follow-up question is for Brian Doubles. Obviously, you talked about the launch of pay in 4 with -- on Clover. I'm just curious, how much of that product is actually being utilized by merchants where you have a relationship versus not? Is it 100% your own customers today? And then also, there's been a significant dislocation in valuations for players in this space. I'm just curious if there's anything you might do differently on a go-forward basis as a result of that? Brian Doubles : Yes. So Sanjay, I would say the majority right now is with existing partners. That's where we've been having discussions over the past nine months, give or take, and integrating and launching. What I would tell you though is Clover is really an opportunity for us to reach a broader distribution of partners that don't do business with us today and make it really easy and seamless for them just to download our app and then pick from our various financing options. So that's really the exciting part as we think about going forward is that one to many integration opportunity, which is frankly different than how we've managed the business in the past. So I think that's an exciting part of our strategy going forward. And then I would say just on valuations generally, I think that does potentially create some opportunities for us. We run a very active M&A pipeline. One of the things we were a little disappointed is as we went through the pandemic, we thought valuations would check up a little bit. They did not, but we're starting to see some of that now. And that could create some opportunities for us, whether it's capabilities that would be easier to buy than build, some things like that. But I would tell you, we are very disciplined around M&A. We only look to do things that are not only strategic but also EPS accretive. And so we've got a pretty disciplined process around that. So I think there may be some more opportunities here just on the margin. But we'll maintain that discipline. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Maybe I wanted to start with asking about loyalty program costs. Those have been increasing, whether we look at it as a percentage of interchange revenue or purchase volume. And I was curious as to what is driving that? Is that just competition? Or are there particular programs, renewals, promotions ongoing that is making that line inflect higher? Just trying to understand how you expect that line to shake out longer term. I think, historically, it used to be around 100% of interchange revenue, maybe a little bit more, but it's pretty materially higher now. So just trying to understand more context there. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So I'd say this is less a function of competition, more a function of -- we've done some value props over the past 12 to 18 months, and we are seeing increased purchase volume through that as our value propositions have resonated with consumers. So there isn't necessarily a reflection we've done it across a number of different programs, which is driving some of the higher loyalty. Again, some of the loyalty sits on our books. The vast majority sits with our partners, which is why the RSA is what it is because they're paying the value prop cost from their proceeds out of the RSA. I think as you look forward, one of the interesting things you're going to see, and you'll see it really began in the third quarter is there's roughly $35 million of interchange that we will lose as our portfolios we sold this quarter have gone away. And the loyalty costs were 100% borne by those partners. So what you'll see is, in theory, a widening of that gap beginning in the third quarter, as we move out. The offset to that $35 million, call it, 80-plus percent comes out of the RSA. So they move in different directions. But from a P&L standpoint, it's neutral. Again, I think in most programs where we collect interchange, and we pay the value prop, it's the same. Some of the programs you got to remember are are ones where we don't collect interchange that are private label products where we may be paying a loyalty cost. And again, this goes back into -- we had record purchase volume ever for this company during this quarter. We had record purchase volume last year for this company, record purchase volume for the first quarter of this year. So that volume is going to generate higher loyalty costs. So it's less about renewals and other things. It's really about our products resonating with consumers. Mihir Bhatia : That is very helpful. And then just wanted to follow up a little bit on Betsy's question about just the credit profile evolution. How much of that is being driven by just your underwriting standards? Maybe just talk about what those look like today versus, say, 2020 or 2018 even? Just trying to understand how things are changing in the context of maybe? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So if you walk through the pandemic, right, the early stages, call it the beginning part of the second quarter, we tightened our standards, right? Now, again, we are very different than most credit card issuers. We don't pull back entirely. It's our distribution model. So we don't necessarily do that. We tend to do things that we would call smarter with regard to credit. So instead of giving someone a dual card, we'll give them a private label card. We're a little bit more restrictive on some of the growth-related credit line increases, so we wouldn't do proactive credit line increases. And at the margin, we would tighten up origination. I think as we moved into the second quarter of 2021, when we saw the environment not being as potentially pessimistic as we did a year earlier, we began to unwind some of those actions and some of those refinements. So again, I think if you look at the standards that exist today, they're probably a little bit tighter than I think, 2019 levels, but approaching that. But our line sizes, again, are lower. But the good news is, I think we continue to introduce different data points into our decisions that makes us -- allows us to make smarter decisions both at the time of origination and at the time in which we're doing account management, i.e., authorizations, et cetera, that allows us to have a better profile. I think when we look at the vintages in '20 and '21, they still are outperforming that of 2018 and 2019. The 2021 vintage, a little bit worse than 2020 because, again, we had probably a looser refinement strategy in '21 but both are significantly better than pre-pandemic levels, and I think sets us up, and that's one of the keys. It sets us up for what we're going to see in '23. So we're very, as we sit here today, optimistic about the credit profile of the Company. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : I was actually going to ask about the vintages, which you just touched on, but is there any sense you can give on the magnitude of outperformance versus 2019, delinquencies controlled for month seasoning or however you want to measure it? Just trying to get a sense of is it a little or a lot or somewhere in between on how much the '20 and '21 vintages are outperforming? Brian Wenzel : What I'd say is '21 is probably in the middle between '20 and '19 and '20 is significantly lower. It's probably how I frame it, Brian. We don't break out actual performance of Device themselves with regard to coincident delinquency or loss rate. But as a frame we referenced '21 in the middle, but significantly below '19. Brian Foran : And then maybe on competitive intensity, I mean you touched a lot of different competitors I guess, broadly, maybe it's fair to say your traditional card competitors are maybe still getting a little bit more intense competitively or maybe reaching a plateau. But again that there's been a pretty big retrenchment seen since some of the newer fintech competitors. So maybe two questions when you balance it all out, is it kind of a net neutral? Or is competition actually maybe pulling back because of the fintech side and any opportunities that, that fintech retrenchment does present? I know you touched on maybe some of the M&A, but maybe organic opportunities that it presents. Brian Doubles : Yes. I think the competitive set has been fairly stable, actually. I don't think that whether you're a mature competitor, one of our larger competitors or the smaller fintechs, I don't think that they've changed their strategies or their competitive intensity, plus or minus given the uncertainty as we head into '23 and '24. I think you might see some of that as we get more through the back half of the year and some of these signs become a little bit more real, if that does materialize. But I would say the competitive set has been pretty consistent. Pricing and economics has continued to be pretty rational. One of the things that we were looking for as we went through the pandemic is, do we start to see competition really take advantage of a best ever credit environment. I think we saw some of that on the fintech side, but the more traditional competitors stayed pretty disciplined. We stayed disciplined. I think that will be helpful going forward. And I think the real question is, what does this look like as we head into '23 and beyond? Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : You mentioned some additional macro overlays on your reserving ratios, or just looking at your overall CECL reserving. Could you give us a little bit more detail on some of those major macro relays that you have embedded within the reserving? And then at what point would you start to say that the reserving level needs to rise? Or like what unemployment rate would you say we start to need to see significant moves in the reserve level? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. So when you look at our baseline model, we start with the Moody's baseline, which is generally going to be a flat, what I would call unemployment environment and a GDP that's generally flat to decelerating over the next couple of years. I think when we start to look at the allowance and look at the overlays that get put in there, right. We're looking at forecasts that have the COI accelerating. So we think about it in two different ways. The first is, probably the easiest way to think about it is late stage performance. So we think about it as you have a deteriorating employment environment, that stresses your late-stage delinquencies, which will flow through the model rather quickly. That's really where we look at it. we look at it in that context of being the roll rates that exist in that overlay as being more dramatic than what we saw pre-pandemic level. So it's a faster roll to loss. The other overlay that we put on it is really related to what we say is related -- coming out of the Russia-Ukraine war that we see out there. And what that does is we have early stage deteriorating more quickly, an upswing in bankruptcies, which are probably at historic lows, and that flows through the model with not as much deterioration in the back end or a severe deterioration in the back end. So you have a much bigger piece flowing through the model. So those are the ways in which we've kind of done the overlays. Let's try to correlate it because, again, I think, Kevin, the one thing that's demonstrated a couple of periods of time here is that you have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics unemployment to loss. Traditionally, you'll see a correlation between gas prices an entry rate in what I would call early stage performance. We're not seeing that today, so your broken correlation. And that's really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that come through. So we have taken it really in two different ways and two different scenarios to create different overlays, which is : one, a severe back-end deterioration; and two, a more front-end deterioration that flows through with what I would call a sharper increase in non-age losses. Kevin Barker : So given the uncertainty that we have out there and the different macro scenarios that could play out, and obviously, the cycle could be different, have you considered being a little bit more conservative in deploying capital in this environment just given the uncertainty we have in the outlook? Brian Wenzel : A couple of things, Kevin. One, we're operating at over 400 basis points above our CET1. So start there, we're in a very different position than probably all of our peers and those in the banking industry. So start with that premise number one. Two, under most scenarios, we have a strong business that generates a lot of capital. And even under stress scenario, we didn't lose money during the pandemic in any quarter. So we continued to generate capital during that period. Three, we just got done with our preliminary run of our second quarter stress test, our normal stress test, and then we run the Moody's S6 and S7 stress tests, and we remain in a very solid position. So as we look at the environment -- as we look at the environment, as we sit here today, look at those stress, look at our position we don't believe there's a reason today to curtail our current share repurchase plans. That being said, we continually look at the macroeconomic environment, and we continue to look at our ability to generate capital through earnings. And if we need to make an adjustment similar to March of '20, we will. But again, as we sit here today, given the stress that we run, the severe stress that we run, we feel comfortable with our current capital plan is in place. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Really appreciate all the color you gave on kind of given the inflationary pressures. Are you seeing any -- though any kind of divergence in trend across the credit spectrum? Or are those trends pretty consistent from kind of super prime all the way down to non-prime? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So what I'd say -- what I'd say, Mark, is we're seeing positive what I would call transaction values and frequency, and consistency of frequency across all credit grades. I think the strongest credit we see is actually in the prime, so not super prime and not non-prime, but we are seeing continued strength in the non-prime. So there's nothing discernible, as I look across the credit grade either on a transaction value basis or a frequency basis, nor do we see it across any of the sales platforms. It's remarkably consistent the performance and the growth across all the platforms by credit grade. So again, I think when we look at the data, and I look at the data by category, what we're seeing is that the consumer is not changing spending dollar-wise and their behaviors. They're just making different decisions inside their everyday spend. And it's not even just moving from discretionary, non-discretionary. They're just being more discriminate with regard to how they're spending their money. And it really goes to the power of the diversification that we have inside our sales platforms and in our -- in our sales platforms and inside of our sales platforms. Mark DeVries : Got it. And then just a follow-up. The payment rate also doesn't really seem to be getting affected given inflation, which seems pretty bullish. But kind of what are your expectations for that as we kind of look out for the back half of the year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Again, we've anticipated that you're going to see a moderation in the payment rate as we move back. We have seen a little bit of a shift in the payment behavior patterns between statement pays and men pays in between. So we've seen some of that moderation we've seen some cohorts go back to 2019 levels. We expect it to begin to migrate back. The migration, I'll be honest with you, from our expectations back in January has been a little bit slower than we anticipated, which just goes back to the overall strength of the consumer. But we do expect it to slow just probably a little bit slower based than I anticipated at the beginning part of the year, which, again, is positive from a credit standpoint. And again, the strength in our purchase volume is helping us to get to that 10-plus percent loan receivable growth by the end of the year. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host. Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition, today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.  Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.  On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another strong quarter of financial results, highlighted by net earnings of $703 million or $1.47 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.8% and a return on tangible common equity of 26.6%. Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent growth and resilient returns is a testament to our well-diversified portfolio, our balanced approach to product, consumer and credit strategies and the strength of our differentiated business model. As we continue to leverage our advanced digital capabilities, expand our reach through new partners and distribution channels and further diversify our product suite, Synchrony further solidifies itself as the partner of choice for retailers, merchants and providers alike. To that end, we added or renewed 15 partners in the third quarter and are excited to be partnering again with Bath and Floor & Decor. has chosen to partner with Synchrony again because they value 3 of Synchrony's core strengths. Our superior customer experience, our advanced data analytics and ability to leverage these data insights to drive growth and the unique marketing opportunities that exist through Synchrony's home network and marketplace, which will enable them to reach more customers and drive growth.  Meanwhile, Floor & Decor has selected to partner with Synchrony again because of our ability to power a multiproduct offering for both consumers and commercial customers. Floor & Decor is a high-growth retailer and believes that Synchrony is best positioned to help them achieve their objectives. So whether they're looking for advanced data analytics and the powerful network effect of our marketplaces and networks, our seamless omnichannel experiences or our diverse suite of financial products and services, Synchrony is well positioned to deliver strong targeted outcomes for each of our partners. We are increasingly anywhere our customers seeks tailored payment and financing solutions. They're small purchases occurring in person or digitally. We leverage our industry expertise, broad distribution channels and dynamic financial ecosystem to connect our partners with customers whenever and however they want to be met with a broad range of products and services, attractive value propositions and seamless experiences that meet their needs at any given moment. As a result, Synchrony continued to reach and serve more customers in the third quarter. On a core basis, excluding the impact of recent portfolio sales on prior year periods, we added 5.8 million new accounts and increased core average active accounts by 8% year-over-year. Purchase volume grew 6% to $44.6 billion or 16% on a core basis, reflecting both the increase in accounts as well as higher engagement across those accounts with 8% higher spend per account versus last year. This continued strength in purchase volume was broad-based across our portfolio and a testament to the breadth and depth of our 5 sales platforms, the compelling value propositions we offer and a healthy consumer. At the platform level, Synchrony achieved double-digit growth in our diversified value, health and wellness digital and home and auto platforms and single-digit growth in our lifestyle platform. More specifically, home and auto purchase volume was 11% higher, driven by strength in home, furniture and auto-related spend, as well as the impact of inflationary conditions on inventory, gasoline and automotive parts. In diversified value, purchase volume increased 20%, driven by higher out-of-partner spend, partner penetration growth and strong retailer performance. Lifestyle purchase volume grew 6%, reflecting an industry-specific rebound within luxury and higher out-of-partner spend more broadly. The 18% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected growth across the platform. We experienced engagement including higher active accounts and spend per account among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches. The 16% increase in health and wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account in our dental and pet categories. We are particularly excited about the opportunities we see in our health and wellness platform to reach more patients and provide them with greater access to flexible financing. As health care costs continue to rise and the burden of out-of-pocket expenses intensified with the growth in high deductible health care plans, there is a clear and growing need for consumers to have access to the financial solutions that empower them with choice, choice in how and when they manage the cost of planned and unplanned medical procedures as well as elective care procedures. Today, Synchrony's Health and Wellness platform encompasses more than 260,000 provider locations, 17 health systems and approximately 75% of the country's dental and veterinarian practice through which we are expanding access to patients. We are a leader in patient care financing for the last 35 years, yet we know there is still more we can do to expand accessibility to Synchrony's patient financing product suite.  We continue to expand our health and wellness partnerships and drive product and experience innovations. We're also broadening our distribution channels to reach and serve more customers through integrations with practice manager providers like Epic and systems like St. Luke's. More recently, we announced our integration with the audiology industry is #1 practice management solution. Through this partnership, Synchro will leverage leadership in the audiology industry and deliver a comprehensive set of financing options. Including both CareCredit Healthcare credit card and Allegro Credit's Buy Now Pay Later financing solutions to more than 5,000 U.S.-based hearing clinics. Synchrony is deeply passionate about empowering Americans to have greater access to responsible and flexible financing options whenever and however they need it. As we continue to add and renew existing leaders in the health and wellness space, including our partnerships with Aspen, Heartland Dental, Sono Bello and American Society of Plastic Surgeons and expand our distribution channels with practice management software like Epic and Synchrony is increasingly the financial ecosystem at the center of patients' daily lives, empowering them with choice and best-in-class value propositions that truly make a difference.  We believe there is no other consumer lender with the industry expertise, customer and provider reach our innovative solutions to help close the gap between Americans patient needs and a suite of financial resources to address them. Turning now to Synchrony's dual and co-branded cards, where we also continue to demonstrate momentum. Purchase volume on these products grew 28% versus last year and represented about 39% of our total purchase volume for the quarter. When tracking average transaction value and frequency trends across the major out-of-partner spend category of these products, we continue to see robust consumer demand across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. As we would expect, there have been some modest seasonal shifts among a few of the major categories in favor of more education-related spend and less travel and entertainment spend. Otherwise, transaction values in gas and auto-related spend have continued to show growth in line with gas price translation, while grocery spend value is running relatively steady with the last few months. The more recent pullback in gas prices appear to have contributed to a slight acceleration in broader discretionary and nondiscretionary spend with categories like clothing, home furnishing and repair, bill pay and auto-related spending experiencing higher transaction value at similar frequency. Putting this all together, the daily and monthly touch points that Synchrony has with our customers across a broad range of purchases tells us that consumer health remains strong and supportive of demand. whether they're taking care of everyday essentials like gas, groceries and medical expenses or making more episodic investments like buying a new mattress or replacing a refrigerator.  Our customers are responsibly accessing financing for their needs maximizing the value they seek and managing well overall as they navigate the pressures on inflation and the uncertainty of the markets. Importantly, Synchrony's customer insights also inform many of the strategies across our business. We utilize this data to deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers, greater outcomes for our partners and more predictive insights for Synchrony as we manage our portfolio to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns through cycles. Our sophisticated underwriting and diverse product suite allow us to respond quickly to changing consumer behaviors and market conditions. Synchrony combines our scale more than 100 million open accounts and billions of transactions with external data, including utility and telecom information, device identification and usage, cash flow and income data and also with partner data, like frequency and value of historical purchase, all to dimensionalize our customer and their transactions. This enables us to more effectively engage and service our customers, make better credit and fraud decisions, and drive prudent profitable growth.  Once our customers begin utilizing our credit products, Synchrony leverages real-time indicators to monitor any shifts in our borrowers' financial well-being, from transaction and payment behavior characteristics to credit bureau alerts. We are closely in tune with our customers and can make both account and portfolio level adjustments quickly. And of course, Synchrony's responsive digital capabilities are complemented by our fully scaled, highly experienced servicing teams to ensure that our customers have appropriate support when they need it. In short, Synchrony's dynamic technology platform is what powers our ability to have a finger on the pulse of each customer and harness the data into actionable insights so that we can optimize the outcomes for all stakeholders. We are able to say yes to more customers, more consistently and for the same level of risk even as market conditions change. This is what ultimately provides invaluable continuity to our partners and customers and resilient risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the third quarter financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's strong third quarter results reflected continued strength in consumer and broad-based demand for the wide range of products and services that our ecosystem seamlessly delivers. Purchase volume of $44.6 billion reflected a 6% increase compared to last year or 16% on a core basis. Continued strength in consumer spend, coupled with some moderation in the payment rate, contributed to 8% higher average balances per account versus last year and 13% growth in ending receivables or 14% on a core basis. Our Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 23% of core receivables and increased 29% from the prior year. Net interest income increased 7% to $3.9 billion, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables, partially offset by the impacts of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of 2022. On a core basis, interest and fees increased 18%. for the third quarter when normalizing for the prior year impact of portfolios recently sold was 17.6%, approximately 10 basis points lower than last year, while still approximately 200 basis points higher our historical average. The interest margin was 15.52% in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7 basis points. The primary driver of this increase was a 51 basis point improvement in loan yields, which contributed 42 basis points to net interest margin. Stronger liquidity portfolio yield also contributed 29 basis points. These improvements in our loan and liquidity portfolio yields were partially offset by the anticipated increase in interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 74 basis points to 2.05% in the quarter and reduced net interest margin by 62 basis points. The mix of interest-earning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly 2 basis points. RSAs were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and 5% of average receivables. The $209 million year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the portfolio sold in the second quarter of 2022 and program performance. Provision for credit losses was $929 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the impact of a growth-driven $294 million reserve build this year compared to a $407 million reserve release in the prior year. Other income decreased $50 million, primarily reflecting the impact of higher loyalty costs. Other expenses increased 11% to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher employee cost and other expenses. Total other expense included $27 million of additional marketing growth reinvestment of Q2's $120 million gain on sale proceeds. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, we expect that the gain on sale and the reinvestment made in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year, will be EPS neutral for the full year 2022. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 36.5% compared to 38.7% last year. Excluding the effects of the gain on sale reinvestment, the efficiency ratio would have been 35.6% and approximately 310 basis point improvement versus last year. Putting it all together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $703 million or $1.47 per diluted share for the third quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 2.8% and a return on tangible common equity of 26.6%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model, combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem. Synchrony is consistently able to meet a broad range of our customers' needs while maintaining cost and credit discipline, which allows us to sustainably grow while delivering consistent risk-adjusted returns. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. We continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the credit spectrum of our portfolio. The vast majority of our borrowers continue to perform consistently with or better than 2019 performance. We continue to monitor borrower behavior closely and note that consumers are still slowly working through excess savings levels from peak levels. The external data we track indicates due to the combination of summer spending and inflationary conditions, the proportion of customers who receive stimulus payments and have since spent the entire amount has increased approximately 2 percentage points since July now around 40% compared to 38% a few months earlier.  The remaining 60% of customers still a portion or all of the stimulus still saved. When tracking consumer savings balance trends by tiers, 0 to 2,500, 2,500 to 5,000 and balances greater than 5,000. The external data suggests that during the course of the third quarter, the top 2 tiers of seamless customers experienced balance reductions of approximately $300 have begun to rebound, while the bottom here are seen at roughly $100 in runoff. Meanwhile, labor markets continue to be robust and portfolio payment rates remain elevated compared to our historical 5-year average. This suggests to us that borrowers generally remain well positioned to support robust demand for goods and services while responsibly meeting their financial obligations. Turning to Synchrony's portfolio, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.28% compared to 2.42% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.43% compared to 1.05% last year. Our third quarter net charge-off rate was 3% versus 2.18% last year. This 82 basis point year-over-year increase generally reflected the gradual progression of our credit losses towards our portfolio underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.58%, down 7 basis points from the 10.65% in the second quarter. Moving on to another source of Synchrony strength, our capital, liquidity and funding. Deposits at the end of the third quarter reached $68.4 billion, an increase of $8.1 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources increased by $1.6 billion. Altogether, deposits represented 82% of our funding while securitized and unsecured debt represented 8% and 10%, respectively, at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $20.3 billion, or 20.1% of our total assets, consistent with last year. We maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least 80% deposits. We expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth, and we'll maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding.  Generally speaking, we manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral. That said, as we continue to grow our deposit base, and actively encourage a rotation from savings to CDs, we're actively extending our deposit duration. As a result, we expect to be slightly liability-sensitive over the near term, while we continue to manage interest rate through term maturities. It's also important to note that through the mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level, Synchrony's RSA will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business. Moving on to discuss Synchrony's strong capital position. Note, that we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. As a result, starting this past January of 2022 and ending in January 2025, Synchrony makes an annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. With that in mind, we ended the quarter at 14.3% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 280 basis points lower than last year's level of 17.1%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.2% under the CECL transition rules compared to 18% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 280 basis points to 16.5%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.1% compared to 26.6% last year. We continue our track record of robust capital returns in the third quarter. In total, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through $950 million of share and $109 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization ending June 2023 was $1.4 billion. Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return considerable capital to our shareholders as guided by our business performance, marking [Technical Difficulty] and incorporates our latest view on the interest rate environment and funding needs. Operating expenses should continue their quarterly run rate of approximately $1.05 billion, excluding the impact of the gain on sale reinvestment plans which are detailed in the appendix of our earnings presentation.  To conclude, Synchrony remains very well positioned to achieve our long-term financial operating targets as the environment normalizes. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony's third quarter financial performance highlighted the benefits of our highly diversified business. Across spend categories, product offerings and distribution channels and through our ever-growing network of partners, merchants and providers Americans' financial needs are increasingly powered by the Synchrony ecosystem. Our ability to efficiently and dynamically leverage real-time data and deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers and partners even as needs evolve and market conditions shift is what enables Synchrony to consistently deliver the outcomes that matter most for our many stakeholders. Utility and value for our customers, sales and loyalty for our partners and providers and sustainable growth and consistent risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So Brian, the fourth quarter net charge-off guide implies a little bit of a ramp. Can you maybe just talk about what is driving that? And then second, you had said in the past that you'd expect to approach more normal levels by the end of '23, call it, 5.5. And obviously, that implies a decent ramp from here. Can you maybe just talk about how you see credit progressing in the intermediate term? And what does this mean for the allowance. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So again, the guide for the quarter, better than our expectation, to be honest with you, as we exited out of the third quarter, delinquency and the loss is a little bit better than our expectation. And when we look at the attributes inside of the portfolio by credit grade, they're performing still better than 2019. So the credit normalization ramp that we see is really on target from what we had projected. And I really view that we'll get back to that mean loss rate as we exit out of 2023 absent a significant change in the macroeconomic event. When you think about the fourth quarter, I mean when you look at our 90-day plus past due delinquencies at $1.2 billion, that's going to lead to a rise in charge-off dollars, but not unexpected and not anything that we look at and say that we're concerned about relative to an accelerating credit normalization trend. So we feel good about credit.  We feel good about the portfolio distribution that we have. And we see back to 2019 levels, including in the nonprime population. So again, we're on target, absent a significant change in the macroeconomic event. When you then parlay that into reserves, right, when you think about the reserves that we have in the books now, clearly, when we look at the unemployment rate, when you have credit normalization, that unemployment rate is projected to be higher, right, in the core model. And then we have overlays for, I would say, a more conservative macro environment. So we believe that the reserve postings going forward, again, should be more growth-driven than anything else, which I think is what you're seeing here in the third quarter. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then the margin is holding up better than expected, given the pace of rate hikes, but Brian, you did reiterate the balance sheet is somewhat liability sensitive. So can you maybe just talk about what is assumed in terms of loan and deposit betas? And then if you look out over the remainder of the rising rate cycle, where do you see the margin in betas going in a 5% Fed scenario just given your balance sheet positioning? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So if you think about the betas that we've experienced to date, so if I look at high-yield savings, roughly around 70% when you think about your 12-month CD rate, when you look at that relative to a swap, it's between 75% and 80%. I would expect, Ryan, to see that tick up a little bit, say, high-yield savings around 80%, and you may see 12-month CDs go to around 1. Again, I think a lot of this is going to depend upon the competition in the market and what funding needs people have. We need to remain competitive with both our digital partners as well as money market funds with regard to that. So we continue to be encouraged by the strong franchise. We've been able to grow deposits after a couple of years of actually shrinking deposits. to manage the margin. So we're encouraged with the franchise and what we're building there. And I think we've been opportunistic with regard to when we access the wholesale market and how we really operate inside both the CD and high-yield savings. We swung to a liability sensitive. We're a little bit more this quarter, not materially more, but a little bit more. But I think locking in certificate of deposits for 12 to 16 months is going to set us up nicely for 2023. And again, we'll be back in January when we see where we exit out of 2022 from a Fed funds perspective and what the Fed anticipates a terminal will be and we'll back to provide some color on how to think about that in next year. Operator : We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Brian, hoping you could kind of talk about as you think about that credit normalization O.bviously, 1 of the features of your P&L that's somewhat unique is the RSA and how that reflects and we've had some kind of puts and takes over the last several years and a good performance this quarter. But could you talk a little bit about how as that normalizes, how you would expect that RSA to behave over the course of 2023? Brian Wenzel : Moshe, again, I think as we've said, and I know people have been frustrated with it, the RSA is acting as a design. So when charge-offs kind of troughed out the RSA peak, now we start to see charge-off dollars rising partially offset by higher interest and fees, but really seeing that flow through the RSA, which gave us a sub-5% RSA for this quarter. Most certainly, we've incorporated that into the guide into the fourth quarter. Again, I think we'll be back in January to kind of give you the trajectory. There's nothing that we look at, Moshe, that says, as you move back towards that normalized mean loss rate of 5.5% that we're going to be outside of the traditional RSA range of 4% to 4.5%. So from a charge-off perspective, it's acting as designed and should go back. Clearly, I think we're going to have to look at how net interest margin and program performance works. But again, we think generally, you're going to see the RSA rate trend down as charge-offs trend up. Brian Doubles : Moshe, the only thing I would add there is, you also have to remember that, that also means that payment rate is going to moderate, and you'll have some top line benefit as well in interest and fees. Moshe Orenbuch : Perfect. And just as a follow-up, I mean you did highlight both the percentage of the business and the growth rates kind of in your co-brand and dual card portfolios. Maybe could you talk a little bit about whether -- how the plan over the next several years? Is the plan to grow that? Does that grow faster? And how do you think about that contributor to Synchrony's overall growth rate? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I'll start and ask Brian to comment. I think, look, we try and grow all of our products as disciplined as we can, achieving risk-adjusted returns. So I think we've seen really good growth on Dual and co-branded cards. Some of that's new program launches. Some of that is new value props that we've launched and refreshed in the last year or 2. We really like that product. It's a great product to graduate customers into over time. So if we start them in a private label card with a relatively modest line once we get comfortable with their creditworthiness and payment behavior, et cetera, and we get to know them and we get a sense for whether or not they're willing to spend outside of the brand than we obviously look at them and upgrade them into a Dual card. So that's a strategy we've had for years. It works really well, both from a risk standpoint as well as a return standpoint. I don't know, Brian, if you want to? Brian Wenzel : Yes. The only thing I'd highlight, Brian, you talked quite a bit about the multiproduct approach here and having the right product for our customers. And when you look at our partner bases, whether it's PayPal, Venmo, Verizon, Walgreens, and some of the other core retailers, TJX, that product just fits nicely into the portfolio. And we do it in a line structure very different than our competitors. So it allows us to control the risk in the portfolio and really optimize the balance. Brian Doubles : And frankly, some of our best, most engaged customers are customers who earn rewards outside of the brand, bring those points back into the brand and our partners really -- they really value that. Those are long-term, very valued customers. Operator : We have our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Kathryn Miller : Actually, Vanessa, I think Mihir Bhatia from Operator : Please proceed, Mihir. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to ask just about the underwriting standards in Have you tightened -- I mean I'm just looking at driving the lower new account this quarter, I'm just trying to understand what could be driving that? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So when we go to the latter part. The lower new account is really the portfolio sold during the second quarter. If you look at it on a core basis, which strips out those portfolios were up 2%, and generated, again, 5.8 million new accounts. From an underwriting standpoint, we have not seen in the portfolio attributes which would require us to take kind of measures across the entire portfolio. That said, Mihir, we always are making refinements and changes to our underwriting standards. We look at partners and performance. So again, we don't see attributes where we need to take a broad-based action. But we are most really taking some small refinements. I also want to go back to what's really unique about our underwriting and what we've done over the last several years is we have not relied upon credit to be the primary driver of growth.  So we haven't changed our underwriting standards. We haven't gone out like a lot of other issuers to use that and credit lines in order to get new accounts. We have people coming to us because they're the most loyal customers of our partners and really want to engage with the value propositions and the brand. And because we get so much data from our partners because we're using unique attributes, which we highlighted in PRISM at our Investor Day. And then you you combine those attributes and rolling together, we think we're making actually hopefully smarter decisions on risk at the end of the day and not having to take more risk. And again, we see nothing that today says we need to tighten across the board. But again, we have the abilities and the tools to manage that risk appropriately if we see a change in the portfolio. Brian Doubles : We try to minimize the ups and downs for our partners as well. So to Brian's point, when times are really good, we don't dig a lot deeper and take advantage of that and then put ourselves in a position where we have to pull way back coming out. I think that consistency and that discipline is important, not just for our own risk and returns, but obviously for our partners, too. So they're not feeling the ups and downs. So we try to stay as consistent as possible. Brian Wenzel : And just 1 final point on that, Mihir, just adding on to Brian's point. If you go back, we provided a chart before, if you look at the volatility in credit through cycles, we're just generally less volatile because of the way in which our line structures are in this underwriting standards and most certainly, you can go back, we've shown the chart a number of different times, and it's because the severity and the consistency kind of gives us a competitive advantage. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. And then maybe just kind of following along with what you said, Brian, about being partners, has that conversation started changing now? And particularly, I guess what I'm asking is around competitive intensity for new partner sign-ups? And are there particular opportunities maybe even with existing partners to grow products just in the pullback in some of the valuations and particularly on the fintech side, are you seeing some partners coming back to you saying, \"Hey, maybe you can add this product.\" Just like just trying to understand how those conversations are going and if there's any opportunities in just the competitive environment right now for partners. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure. So look, I would start by saying it's still a pretty competitive environment out there. I think given what has happened in some of the fintech space, you've seen a little bit of a pullback there maybe a little bit less aggressive in terms of offers and rates, et cetera. But what I'll tell you is that as we're out talking to our partners and prospects what's really resonating right now is the multiproduct strategy being able to offer Buy Now Pay Later, paying for migrating to other products in our portfolio. Because I think one of the things that our partners have seen is that depending on the consumer, depending on the product that's being purchased, and frankly, depending on the macroeconomic environment, pay gets a lot more expensive in an environment where rates are rising at the pace that they're rising.  So I think partners have taken a step back and now they're trying to rationalize their point of sale and saying, \"Hey, look, how do I optimize this for the economy that I'm operating in for my consumer for what they're buying.\" And what's great is we can go in and say, look, for this product, we think it's a 12-month, 6-month promotional financing product with an opportunity to upgrade them into a revolving product down the road. That's pretty powerful. That's pretty powerful because it gives optionality and it helps them manage the expense side of the equation, too, in terms of what those financing offers cost them on what it takes out of their margins. So we're seeing really good traction in terms of the discussions that we're having out there both with our existing partners as well as new prospects. Operator : Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess first question for Brian Wenzel. On your comments related to being liability-sensitive. Understandably, you might have some headwinds on the NIM. But I'm just trying to think about NII. So your yield is obviously benefiting from rates, but also higher revolve. Could you just help us parse through that and think about NII going forward? Brian Wenzel : Sure, Sanjay. So when you think about NIM, if I think about it sequentially for the quarter, we picked up about 30 basis points of prime benefit in the yields. We looked up about 4 benefits relating to merchant discounts. So when you look at the prime impact of 30 merchant discount for some of the investment portfolios on the cash position, picking up 16, we largely offset the interest expense increase. So certainly neutral. The important part, though, Sanjay, is -- when I look at the price benefit, the effect of prime for the quarter was 4.75%. We tend to be a little bit slower the way our cards bill out and change APRs. So we have some more room to increase that as we move into the fourth quarter. When you think about the merchant discount pricing, we're about 60% to 70% of that price through to our partners, and that's something that we try to be measured on and deal with competition.  So we think that from a margin perspective, most certainly, I think in the guide in the fourth quarter, we should get those tailwinds kind of coming through again. Some of the portfolio will be resetting as you got a full quarter price for some of the CDs and things like that, that we put on in the third quarter as well as the increase in the high-yield savings, but we feel good about it. Again, I think locking up at these rates, if you believe that the interest rate cycle is going to continue to move up here in the latter part of the fourth quarter into next year, having those particular positives and being a little bit liability sensitive right now, should benefit us next year as we move forward. Again, we'll be back in January with probably some more comprehensive thoughts on it, Sanjay. But that's kind of how to think about it. So we got a small lift when I go back to the revolve rate and fees going up with delinquencies, partially offset by reversals. But again, the prime rate is flowing through. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. Then maybe a question for Brian Doubles, just following up on what Mihir was asking earlier. I mean I kind of asked this question last quarter, but you have another quarter of a dislocation among fintech valuations. You've had the CFPB obviously come in with some comments on regulatory actions potentially for Buy Now Pay Later. I'm just curious if that's presenting an opportunity for you guys? Do you feel like there might be some more sensitive moves you can -- I mean, just broadly speaking, maybe you could just address that a little bit more. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Sanjay. Look, I think we're absolutely playing off. I do think there's been a little bit of a checkup in the market now. Partners are thinking about these products and and how they want to design their point of sale for the future. And this is where, again, we think the multiproduct strategy wins over the long term. And I'll comment quickly on just the regulatory environment, we think also favors us. I mean we are heavily regulated today, as you know. And we would certainly advocate for a level playing field. That doesn't exist today. So I think to the extent that some of these products around the periphery become more regulated and more scrutinized than I think that's a net positive for us. And so I think there are some -- a few things that kind of play to our advantage. For the first time in a few years, with valuations where they are, maybe that presents some some attractive M&A opportunities, if there is something on the technology side that would be faster to buy than to build. So that's something that we're always looking at. We've got a very active M&A screen. I think we're also very disciplined, very focused on valuations. And that was one of the things that we didn't see over the last couple of years was attractive entry points. But again, that's something that we run a very active process on, and we'll continue to look at, but very disciplined around valuation and impact to EPS. So... Operator : Our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Brian, you did get into this, you were talking -- you guys gave us good information about the different platforms, and you talked a little bit about the customers different use of the product. But I'm wondering, I mean, just where we are in the cycle, given that we're kind of moving through an inflationary environment that I think is kind of new to all of us. Is there any kind of behavioral aspects of the customers that are changing that you think changes the value proposition, thinking about the different uses like dual-purpose versus co-brand versus the NPL. Are you seeing shifts in that? And does that give you any indications for what to kind of on the intermediate term? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Let me start, and then Brian may add some commentary. John, when we look at the consumer spending behavior patterns. We're not seeing very much changed, right? They're being very consistent. They are making choices, right, where people are saying, okay, maybe I'm sending a little bit more for grocery or gas, spending a little bit less on T&E. But we're seeing very much consistency as we think about average transaction value and frequency consistently throughout the year. And we look at it by credit grade by platform. We look at the world composition components. So everything seems to be consistent. So the customer itself is not migrating or changing their spending behavior patterns. We continue to see just tremendous positive growth relative to our Millennial and Gen Z. They make about 25% of our sales. They're our fastest-growing cohort at, call it, 400 to 500 basis points higher than the company average. So they continue to to view that. Again, the value propositions have to resonate with the customers, and we continue to think that in the multiproduct and distribution model that we have, we just think is attractive. So we have not seen the consumer from a spending behavior pattern change significantly, again, making smarter decisions, but overall level of spend, not really changing. Brian Doubles : I think what we're starting to see on the merchant side, and I think Brian covered the consumer really well. On the merchant side, I think you will see -- we have started to see and we'll continue to see some adjustment in terms of what financing offers are are presented to the customer because they are trying to manage in a higher interest rate environment, their costs. I mentioned that particularly you get to some of the really short-dated stuff is that gets pretty expensive at your 0% to the consumer and the merchants paying for all of that. So we have seen some partners working to rationalize the product offerings inside of their businesses. John Hecht : Okay. That's very helpful. And then second unrelated question. Just thinking about the RSA next year, as Brian, maybe you can remind us, is the correlation for the -- as credit normalizes, is the correlation for the RSA delinquencies, provisions, charge-offs? And is there any seasonality or timing differences for us to think about there? Brian Wenzel : Yes. John, we'll be back in January and 2023 as a whole. But I think if you think about the RSA, charge-offs move immediately through the RSA line, right? So you're going to see that impact as that normalizes into 2023, that will provide a benefit to the RSA. The other 2 components, I think, to think about is reserve postings or otherwise flow through the RSA a little bit of a lag. So that will impact it. But again, Brian consistently points out rightfully so that as credit normalizes, we would expect to see your revenue increase and the yield increase on the portfolio. So again, if we don't see the payment rate change, you're not going to have that normalization, they have to work in concert. So again, I think those are the general gives and takes. I think the other thing will be how cost of funds really moves and that flows through as a benefit to the RSA in a rising rate environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Growth has been extremely strong, not only for you guys, but also across the industry as payment rates have slowed and savings rates have come down. Given you see out there from a macro perspective in these declining savings rate, would you expect this growth to to slow considerably as we move through the next few quarters and probably get more down to a more normal rate, maybe in the mid-single digits as we get through near the end of 2023. It just seems like these growth rates obviously aren't able to be sustained for an extended period of time. Brian Wenzel : Yes. The way I think about it, Kevin, is you have this period of time where the consumer is working through, number one, excess liquidity that they have. So that saves rate. Now we'll carry you through, particularly on some of the higher spenders well into 2023. In some of the lower credit quality cohorts and you're seeing wage gains that are offsetting inflation. So you have some tailwinds with regard to spend, and you see that strong spending behavior pattern. What we probably anticipate is as some of that savings drives up and some of maybe the lack of -- or the utilization of lower discretionary spending because people aren't going in the office every day. As that tightened a little bit, what you're going to see is probably spending come down and payment rate come down. But I think what you're going to see first is payment rate begin to slow. Spending stay there, you're going to see balances go up. And then you're going to see purchase volumes slow. So I think there could be a elongation of asset growth here in the short term. Again, we'll have to see how the economy and the macroeconomics and plays out for a medium term. But clearly, there are probably more tailwinds than headwinds in the short term. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then you addressed it earlier on some addressed underwriting standards and no changes there, trying to maintain you continue to target $2.4 billion, I believe, buyback program. What type of macro conditions or underlying spending trends, do you -- would you have to see play out before you would start to reconsider whether it's underwriting standards or continuing to buy back stock at the level that you're buying it back? Brian Doubles : Well, I'll start and ask Brian to comment. Look, we are running the business very nimbly right now. We're ingesting thousands of data points every day on what the consumer is doing, payment trends and behaviors. We look at it by program, by product, by geography. We're looking for any indicators that say we need to make some tweaks as we go. And I call them tweaks because this -- for us, this is not an event. It's not 1 day you're risk on and the day of risk off. It's you kind of take what you're seeing every day and you kind of make changes and slight modifications as you go. And we feel really good about our ability to do that. We've invested a lot in our technology platform, our data sources, our tools. And so there isn't 1 thing that we look at. But as we're looking at percent of customers that make the payment, how much above the payment are they making, who's gone late for the first time. Those are all little tells and little signs that say, okay, maybe we go in and we turn the dial a little bit. And so again, we feel really good about our ability to do that. We're not seeing anything right now that is concerning. It's been a very gradual, I'd call it, normalization. As we move through the year, in fact, I think every quarter, we updated our credit guidance and it was always modestly better than we thought 90 days prior. So I think we are still in a pretty good operating environment. We don't see anything that says we got to go in and really ratchet down creating and certainly nothing that says we got to do anything different than what we're doing on the share repurchase side. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Brian covered Let me just talk a little bit about capital. I think when we look at our business model, we have tremendous -- I think we're selling seeing the margin and our capital generation capacity. So I think as we look out, we look at what's our ability to generate capital, we look at the growth in the RWAs, we look at preserving the dividend. And then we run our stress test. And again, as we continue to run those quarterly, we don't see anything even in some of the most severe scenarios that would have us alter or slow down the repurchase activities and capital plans we have in place, but we do that every quarter. we'll continue to do it. And as long as we can continue to generate strong returns, we feel good about our capital position moving towards our target. But ultimately, we're going to have to fully develop the capital stack to achieve the target, and that's a little bit reliant upon the capital markets, but we feel good there. And again, I think when you put the story together, we really do feel good about the margin of the business when you think about the yield and the losses and then capital generation capacity. Operator : The next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : I just wanted to talk a little bit about the allowance coverage. Given where we are, both in terms of growth, you guys are indicating that credit will continue to normalize. We saw an uptick in delinquencies, economic outlook is changing. Why do we see the allowance coverage drift down a little bit? And should we expect that to start heading higher as we move into 2023? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Rick. So when you look at how we have built our reserve models, right? So you look at our baseline macroeconomic forecast, which, again, we take from Moody's as a starting point, and which shows, call it, an employment rate next year of 4%. When we think about credit normalization, right, and getting back to that 5.5% as we look at the underwriting cohorts we put on over the last couple of years, that migration back to 5.5%. The implied unemployment rate in the model is higher than that. So think about something that's probably closer to the mid-4s effectively. We don't necessarily put that in. But effectively, it shows a higher unemployment rate. We then, on an overlay basis, say, okay, if there is some concern, what does that scenario look like? So effectively, it gives us a higher coverage as we sit here today than than what you would normally expect given the delinquency profile if you just looked at it by its own. So unless there's a significant deterioration beyond that, and we don't see that, then you're really going to be in growth driven reserves. If we just looked at delinquencies today and ran our quantitative models, it would be below day 1 CECL, right? So we think we're adequately reserved today to encompass what we think is going to happen in in 2023 and moving out. So we feel good about it. I think when you look at the delinquencies that we have in here for 3Q, it gives you a pretty good line of sight into what to expect both fourth quarter and most likely first quarter. So you can plan that out. And again, absent something significantly change in the macro environment, we feel pretty good about where the coverage is and that we're adequately reserved for under various scenarios. Richard Shane : Yes. It's interesting. I think we're all struggling with the same thing, which is that we have a concern going forward. But empirically, when we look at the data today, it's hard to sort of connect the dots in terms of that deterioration. So we're running the same issues. Brian Wenzel : Yes. But I think you have to look at it. If I just ran the pure quantitative model, I'd just go back to this point again, you'll be below day 1 CECL. And it's really the qualitative models and those overlays that is pushing you higher than day 1 and in theory allowing. So if you looked inside our quarter, our quantitative models moved up and our qualitatives moved down as it kind of got embedded into the core delinquency formation. So again, I know we don't provide a lot of ability and people don't provide visibility into all those different models, but they are working in concert with each other. And that's where we get comfort that we're appropriately provisioned at the end of the quarter. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So two questions. One, I know we talked quite a bit about the net interest margin already. It's down a bit from the peaks that you had earlier this year. And the exit run rate looks like it's around 15.27%, somewhere in that range for fourth quarter. And I'm hearing you talk about the migration of the funding mix looking to go from savings to CDs. And I noticed your CD offer is pretty robust here, 15 months that you've got at 3.91. So are you suggesting that with the forward curve where the Fed gets to 4.6% or 4.7%, 4.8%, depending on which day you look at it, that you lock that in on the yield side and as that comes through and your funding cost migrates higher, but is relative to what the would do. Do you feel like the trajectory here should be continuing this path of decline as we move through the year next year? Or do you think that your shift to CDs can halt that slide? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Again, Betsy, we'll be back in January to give you a lot better guidance and visibility into NIM. The way I would think about it, the pieces that you have moving inside of NIM, again, from the yield side, you're going to have the slowing payment rate give you better revolve in the short term, higher late fees, partially offset by some reversals. You're going to see this continued effect of prime moving. We bill almost on a 45-day lag to when prime changes. So you're going to see that effect of prime move through the portfolio. We have the ability to adjust merchant pricing. So those are the, I call it, tailwinds to NIM. Again, I do think locking in certificates of deposits at this rate, if you do believe that the Fed is going to continue to rise into 2023, while it may give you a little bit of pressure in the current quarter or 2 is going to be better as you move throughout the following year. So it's that shift. Again, a lot of this is going to depend upon what money market funds do and what other institutions do. We clearly see some customers migrating for yield, but we were going to remain competitive. The positive news for us, we also see money flowing out of big money center banks that aren't paying a lot for deposits, which gives us an attractive source. And again, so we're optimistic that we can manage the funding profile, and we'll be back in January to detail a little bit more. Betsy Graseck : And then just a follow-up question on your partner activity and how they're looking for you to help them with their sales growth as you go into next year, which is expected to be a little bit of a slower paced environment. Can you give us any sense as to any credit box changes that would come as a result of that or other ways that you can help drive your partners' revenue growth? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure, Betsy. Look, I think Brian said it earlier, we really don't try to rely on opening the credit box to drive sales, that it typically doesn't end well. So we try and stay very consistent discipline there. What we do work with our partners on is more around the value proposition for the customer. as well as being able to offer multiple products. And I th k that's really where we're focused. We're having really good discussions with our partners around how we're going to support them for hopefully a strong holiday and that is offers, experience, it's offering new products that are tailored for their customer. I think it's really that entire kind of ecosystem that we work on with our partners to drive sales for them. It's a proven model. I think we've only enhanced it with the investments we've made over the last couple of years, and we're pretty optimistic that we're going to support them, and hopefully a strong holiday and into a hopefully strong 2023. Operator : We have no further questions. Kathryn Miller : That now concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our earnings call.

Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for, and does not edit or guarantee, the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony closed the year on a very strong note with fourth quarter net earnings of $577 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.1%. These financial results contributed to full year 2022 net earnings of over $3 billion or $6.15 per diluted share, our second highest in company history; a return on average assets of 3.1% and a return on tangible common equity of 28.5%. This performance was driven by continued strength across the fundamental drivers of our business and a high level of execution across our key strategic priorities throughout the year.  We achieved record purchase volume of $180 billion for the full year, which surpassed our prior year's record and was 15% higher on a core basis. Spend per active account was 7% higher for the year, reflecting robust consumer demand across the broad range of products and services for which Synchrony offers flexible financing. We also acquired 23.6 million new accounts and grew average active accounts by 8% on a core basis. The combination of strong consumer spend and some moderation in payment rate contributed to ending receivables growth of 15%. As expected, credit continued to normalize across our portfolio with full year losses of 3%, still more than 250 basis points below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, which is generally the level at which our risk-adjusted margin is more fully optimized.  And finally, Synchrony continued to drive progress toward our long-term operating efficiency target, reflecting the combined impacts of our cost discipline, the inherent operating leverage in our highly scalable model and strong revenue growth. Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent growth and strong returns is a testament to our well-diversified portfolio, our balanced approach to product and credit strategies, our compelling value propositions and the strength of our business model. As a result, Synchrony was able to return more than $3.8 billion of capital to shareholders during 2022, $3.3 billion of which was through share repurchase, a 17% reduction in our shares outstanding. When we look back on 2022 and the calibre results we were able to deliver for our customers, our partners and providers and our shareholders, it really all comes back to the dedication shared by the Synchrony team as we realize our ultimate goal : to power commerce by delivering a leading digital ecosystem, connecting our partners and customers through world-class technology, products and capabilities. Over the last year, Synchrony has built upon the core strengths of our differentiated business model by executing on the key strategic priorities that are driving progress towards that collective goal. We continue to expand and enhance our partner programs, including the addition of more than 30 partners and the renewal of more than 50 relationships, including most recently Lowe's, with whom we've partnered for over four decades to drive innovation and value to both their do-it-yourself and pro customers. Synchrony also continued to diversify our products, programs and markets during 2022, deepening our reach and expanding the utility and value we offer to our customers and partners alike. We continue to scale our diverse product suite with the launch of Synchrony's Installment and Pay-in-4 products at a number of retailers and providers, including Belk and Discount Tire. These six pay offerings represent another financial tool that we can offer to qualifying customers while also driving incremental sales to our partners and providers. And whether it's delivering flexible financing offers in a dental practice, connecting a customer with a large partner through a seamless mobile transaction are driving incremental sales at small and midsized businesses. Synchrony meets our customers, partners and providers wherever they are in their digital or retail journey and deliver the right product at the right time. For this reason, we launched a number of strategic partnerships over the last year to expand our distribution channels and broaden customer access to our comprehensive product suite. Through integrations with point-of-sale and business management platforms like Clover, and practice management solutions like Sycle, Synchrony has added hundreds of thousands of small business locations and several thousand provider locations through whom we can seamlessly and responsibly offer access to flexible financing. At year-end, Synchrony had more than 460,000 merchant provider locations and 71 million active customers. So when you think about the sheer size and scale of the constituencies we serve, and the wide range of financing needs we deliver through omnichannel experiences, it should come as no surprise that our dynamic technology platform is at the center of it all. During the last year, Synchrony continued to innovate and scale our digital capabilities to ensure that we can remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving consumer financing landscape. We drove greater mobile customer engagement through a number of initiatives, including both our digital wallet provisioning and the Synchrony app. Accounts provision for digital wallet use in 2022 increased 75% compared to last year contributing to 85% of mobile wallet sales growth. And in terms of our mobile app, we upgraded our [Sy] (ph) pipelines to the latest version, which delivers new features, including a new user experience, freeze my card, e-statements, autopay, apply and Apple Pay push provisioning. As a result, unique visitors and payments within the SyPi channel each grew by more than 20% compared to last year. In today's tech forward world, a best-in-class customer experience is characterized by seamless, intuitive and hyper-personalized engagement. This, in turn, requires a more comprehensive understanding of each customer as we connect them with partners and providers and anticipate which products and services will optimize the experience. For that reason, we are constantly driving deeper integrations, leveraging more predictive and actionable insights throughout our digital ecosystem and developing solutions that are grounded in our customer experience insights. Over the last year, Synchrony achieved over 70% growth in the number of applications using our APIs and more than 80% growth in API transactions, including from our clients and partners leveraging Synchrony APIs to power their digital experience. Our partnership with PayPal is a great example of how together we continue to leverage more APIs to enhance our offerings and drive an even more seamless experience for their customer. In Q1, we launched PayPal Savings, which enabled instantaneous movement of funds between PayPal balances, no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their financial goals. In addition, existing PayPal customers are able to quickly and easily open their PayPal savings account inside PayPal's Super App. In Q2, we launched our new and refreshed co-branded PayPal Cashback credit card with a best-in-class cash-back offering and a fully integrated experience within the PayPal app, powered by native APIs. And in Q4, we enhanced our everyday value proposition on the Venmo co-branded card by introducing free person-to-person payments, the 3% fee is waived for the consumer when they use their Venmo Visa. We are really pleased with what the PayPal and Synchrony teams have been able to execute as we grow and evolve in new and unique ways, empower top of wallet products and best-in-class experiences for our customers. Synchrony also launched our new cardholder service platform across many of our largest portfolios in 2022. This new platform offers customers the ability to service their accounts in one dashboard, and enables a broad suite of account notifications across every aspect of the credit life cycle. These notifications include a range of instant transaction alerts, all enhanced with enriched merchant data and a completely redesigned digital service experience. In addition to text and e-mail alerts, we are able to deliver these notifications and alerts directly within our partners' iOS and Android apps by leveraging our patented SyPi platform, continuing to enhance the customers' experience within our partners' brands. While this new account manager is still in its early stages, we observed some strong trends in response to the launch. 60% of those logging in have more than one account, and 80% of our users stated that their experience was easy or very easy to use and a top driver of their satisfaction. In fact, this more dynamic interface has achieved a double-digit improvement in our transactional Net Promoter Score compared to our previous account management site. This new platform will span the broad set of financial products that Synchrony offers and will enable intuitive, self-service and highly customized and personalized experiences, increased speed to market of features and solutions for our partners and a more effective way for Synchrony to engage and power and deepen our relationships. Accordingly, as we continue to scale and integrate more of our products in the coming year, we believe this enhanced account manager will become an increasingly powerful tool to drive higher quality engagement and deeper value for our customers, partners and Synchrony alike. To that end, we also remain focused on driving greater connectivity across our vast customer and partner basis with the expansion of our Synchrony marketplace. Mysynchrony.com connects customers with information and relevant offers from brands that they trust. These offers are powered by proprietary insights that Synchrony has gleaned through a variety of resources, including online search activity within their shopping category and location to provide personalized offers to the right audience at the right time. As we continue to enhance this level of personalization and launch capabilities, like prequalification within our marketplace over the last year, mysynchrony.com achieved a 25% increase in both new accounts and sales as well as 11% growth in referrals to our partners. This is a testament to the deep customer relationships that our network products foster. Synchrony's ability to leverage our marketplaces like mysynchrony.com or carecredit.com to drive new and existing customer traffic as well as incremental and repeat sales to our partners has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator and an important growth driver for our business longer term. In summary, Synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customers looking to make a purchase or a payment. Big or small, in-person or digitally, we can meet them whenever and however they want to be met with a broad range of products and services to meet their needs in any given moment. This ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners and providers alike is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss fourth quarter financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's strong fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of Synchrony's purpose-built business model at work. The diversification of our portfolio across industries and spend categories supported by sophisticated underwriting and disciplined credit management enabled continued purchase volume growth that surpassed last year's record level. In addition, the alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners through our retailer share arrangements is performing as intended. Excluding the impact of portfolio sales, our RSA declined as credit losses continue to normalize and funding costs began to rise, enabling Synchrony's delivery of consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns as we have done for many years. The scalability and efficiency of our dynamic technology platform is enabling operating leverage even as we invest in our business. And Synchrony's strong balance sheet continue to support our customers and partners as their own needs evolve. In combination, these business drivers have continued to uniquely position Synchrony in our ability to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers and our partners and consistent returns to our shareholders even as market conditions change. Let's now discuss Synchrony's fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Purchase volume grew 2% to $47.9 billion, reflecting a 3% higher spend per account versus last year. On a core basis, purchase volume grew 11%. This continued strength in purchase volume was broad-based across our portfolio, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our five sales platforms, the compelling value propositions we offer and continued consumer demand. At the platform level, Synchrony achieved double-digit growth in our Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness and Digital platforms and single-digit growth in our Home & Auto and Lifestyle platforms. More specifically, in Diversified & Value, purchase volume increased 15% driven by higher out-of-partner spend in addition to partner performance and penetration growth. The 10% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume reflected the growth in average active accounts and greater customer engagement. Health & Wellness purchase volume grew 15% compared to last year as we experienced broad-based growth in active accounts as well as higher spend per active account. In Home & Auto, purchase volume increased 9%, generally reflecting strong spend in home and higher prices in furniture. And in Lifestyle, purchase volume was 2% higher, driven by higher out-of-partner spend. Turning to Synchrony's dual and co-branded cards where we continue to experience strong growth. Core purchase volume on these products grew 21% versus last year and represented approximately 40% of our total purchase volume for the quarter. As we discussed in the past, our customers derive great value from our dual and co-branded cards because they combine best-in-class rewards with broad utility. Generally speaking, approximately half of our out-of-partner spend is comprised of nondiscretionary spend by billpay, discount store, drugstore, healthcare, grocery, and auto and gas. And while we observed some minor category shifts during December, for example, from T&E related spend towards more clothing and other retail as well as a reduction in auto and gas-related spend towards more grocery and discount spend, Synchrony's relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary out-of-partner spend has remained essentially unchanged. Consistently strong consumer spend, coupled with some moderation in payment rate contributed to 10% higher average balances per account versus last year and 15% growth in ending receivables. Our dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of core receivables and increased 28% from the prior year. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.1 billion, primarily reflecting a 13% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables and higher loan receivable yields, partially offset by the impacts of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of 2022. On a core basis, interest and fees increased 21%. Payment rate for the fourth quarter, when normalizing for the prior year impact of the portfolios recently sold, was 17%, approximately 75 basis points lower than last year and approximately 160 basis points higher than our five-year historical average. The net interest margin was 15.58% in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 19 basis points. The primary driver of the decrease was higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 168 basis points to 2.86% and reduced net interest margin by 136 basis points. The mix of interest-earning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly 6 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by a 92 basis point improvement in loan yields, which contributed 79 basis points to net interest margin, and our liquidity portfolio yields, which contributed 44 basis points. RSAs were $1 billion in the fourth quarter and 4.68% of average loan receivables. The $224 million year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022 and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. Provision for credit losses were $1.2 billion for the quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the impact of a growth-driven $425 million reserve build and higher net charge-offs. Other income decreased $137 million, primarily reflecting the impacts of the prior year's venture investment gain and the current quarter's higher loyalty costs driven by our strong purchase volume. Other expenses increased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs, technology investments and transaction volume, partially offset by $75 million of asset impairments and certain incremental marketing investments recognized in the prior period. The fourth quarter employee cost included certain additional compensation items of $21 million, higher stock-based compensation and higher headcount driven by growth and in-sourcing. Total other expense included $12 million of additional marketing and growth reinvestment from second quarter's $120 million gain on sale proceeds. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, the $120 million gain on sale and reinvestment made in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year were EPS neutral for the full year 2022. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 37.2% compared to 41.1% last year. Putting it all together, Synchrony generated fourth quarter net earnings of $577 million or $1.26 per diluted shares. We also generated a return on average assets of 2.2% and return on tangible common equity of 22.1%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. The external deposit data we monitor continues to reflect a slow reduction in consumer savings. Average deposit balances at the end of December were down approximately 5% from their peak in March of 2022, but still approximately 1% higher than 2021's average and 12% higher than 2020's average. On an annualized trend basis, the savings decline that began around that March 2022 peak appears to have started to slow in December, primarily in terms of its intensity. Turning to Synchrony's portfolio, credit normalization continued as expected during the fourth quarter. These digits are still performing better than 2018. And delinquency entry rates remain lower than the historical average at approximately 80% of their pre-pandemic levels. That said, as consumer savings rates has decreased, borrower payment behavior is reverting towards pre-pandemic levels with normalizing entry rates into delinquency and higher roll rates in early delinquency stages following the charge-offs. This trend continued in the fourth quarter as payment rate normalization trends expanded from the nonprime segments of our portfolio into the prime and super prime segments, where the average outstanding balances tend to be larger. Relative to period end receivables, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.65% compared to 2.62% last year and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.69% versus 1.17% in the prior year. And our fourth quarter net charge-off rate increased to 3.48% from 2.37% last year, still remaining well below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, at which point portfolio credit risk is better optimized relative to profitability. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.30%, down 28 basis points from the 10.58% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of an asset growth-driven reserve builds, which was more than offset by the impact of receivables growth in the denominator. Moving to another source of Synchrony's strength, our capital, liquidity and funding. Deposits at the end of the fourth quarter reached $71.7 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources decreased by $316 million. Altogether, deposits represented 84% of our funding, while securitized and unsecured debt represented 7% and 9%, respectively, at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $17.2 billion or 16.4% of our total assets, consistent with last year. We maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and our secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least 80% deposits. We expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth, and we'll maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding. We manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral. That said, as we continue to grow our deposit base, and given the level of interest rates, consumers are actively rotating from savings to CDs. This has had the effect of extending our deposit duration while making our balance sheet slightly liability sensitive. We will continue to manage interest rate risk through term maturities. It's also important to note through its mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level, Synchrony's RSA will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business. Moving on to discuss Synchrony's capital position. Note that we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. As a result, starting this past January of 2022, and continuing in January of 2023, Synchrony makes an annual transition adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. It should also be noted that the FASB CECL update for the accounting of TDRs becomes effective for Synchrony as of January 2023. This accounting standard update eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, which previously followed a separate process using a discounted cash flow methodology to quantify the TDR-specific reserve requirement. Synchrony is adopting this update on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2023. Based on our current estimate, the adoption will result in approximately $300 million reduction to our reserve balance, which we recognize net of tax and equity. The netted impact of the adoption will contribute approximately 25 basis point increase to our capital ratios. From a capital metric perspective, we ended the quarter at 12.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 280 basis points lower than last year's level of 15.6%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.6% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.5% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 280 basis points to 15%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.4% compared to 24.4% last year. Synchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns in the fourth quarter. In total, we returned $803 million to shareholders through $700 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $700 million. Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. As we make further progress toward our targeted capital levels, we look to develop our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock and the issuance of subordinated debt. Finally, let's turn to our 2023 outlook for the full year, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation. We expect strong consumer demand for the wide variety of products and services we finance to support continued broad-based purchase volume growth. As excess consumer savings continue to decline, year-over-year purchase volume growth rate should slow. Payment rates should also continue to moderate but we\u2019re still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels throughout 2023. Together, these dynamics should contribute to ending receivables growth between 8% and 10%. We expect our net interest margin to be between 15% and 15.25% for the full year and follow typical seasonal trends. This outlook is based on a peak Fed funds rate of 5.25% and incorporates the following five impacts during 2023. One, the increase in interest-bearing liabilities cost due to higher benchmark rates and the potential competitive pressures or higher retail deposit betas to address funding needs; two, higher interest and fee yields, partially offset by higher income reversals as delinquency and charge-offs continue to normalize; three, an increase in our liquidity portfolio yields, primarily reflecting the higher benchmark rates; four, the fluctuation of mix of average loan receivables relative to average interest-earning assets as driven by the seasonal growth trends and timing of our funding; and five, the full year impact of the portfolios sold during second quarter 2022. Before we turn to our credit outlook, it's important to note there are a number of uncertainties that could change our expectations and the trajectory of credit normalization. We have greater visibility for the first half of this year and any significant changes in the medium-term macroeconomic backdrop would more likely impact portfolio credit trends in 2024. With regard to our portfolio's credit trajectory in 2023, we expect most of the portfolio delinquency metrics to have reached normalized levels or equivalent to pre-pandemic levels by midyear. Accordingly, the associated charge-offs will reach pre-pandemic levels approximately six months later. The seasonal impact of tax refunds and bonuses in the first half, and the third quarter's acceleration of receivables growth will likely lead to a decline in net charge-off rate for Q3 before credit losses rise and continue the normalization path through the fourth quarter. Given our expectation that delinquency metrics will reach their pre-pandemic levels by midyear, we expect net charge-offs to be between 4.75% to 5% for the full year, still considerably below our pre-pandemic annual loss rate target of 5.5% to 6%. We run multiple economic scenarios to inform our credit outlook as part of our normal business process. Our baseline reserve assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 4.2% by year-end. We have qualitative overlays for the current uncertainty and possibility of a mild recession. In this scenario, we'd expect the unemployment level closer to 5%. This is reflected in our fourth quarter 2022 reserve rate, which is still higher than our day 1 CECL rate. Barring any significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we do not expect our portfolio to reflect our fully normalized annual loss rate target until 2024. Accordingly, we continue to expect reserve builds in 2023 to be generally asset-driven and that the reserve rate will gradually migrate towards approximately 10% as credit normalization brings our portfolio net charge-offs back to that mean annual loss rate to which we've been underwriting. RSA expense will continue to serve as a functional alignment of economic interest with our partners, reflecting the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth, offset by rising net charge-offs. As a result, we expect RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to be between 4% and 4.25%. Should credit normalize at a slower rate than we expect, RSAs will likely come closer into the high end of that range. And the extent that funding costs or net charge-off rise to the high end or beyond of our current assumptions, we expect the RSA to come in to the low end or lower than this range. In terms of other expense, we remain committed to delivering operating leverage, such that expenses grow at a slower rate than net interest income. Our full year expectation that expenses will run approximately $1.125 billion per quarter to the extent that receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year will moderate our spending where appropriate while still prioritizing the best long-term prospects for our business. As we demonstrated throughout this past year, Synchrony's business and financial models are performing as it's designed to do. Our proprietary data and analytics, diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack allow us to reach and improve more customers for the same level of risk while leveraging low customer acquisition costs and driving greater customer lifetime value. Our retailer share ranges are effectively aligning our partners' economic interest with our own, and in doing so, enabling Synchrony to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions. And our robust balance sheet is providing funding flexibility as we seek to provide continuity to our customers and partners when they need it most. In short, Synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient risk-adjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and partners evolve. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial operating targets as market conditions stabilize. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Looking to 2023 and beyond, Synchrony is well positioned to navigate the uncertainties of the operating environment that lies ahead. As we continue to leverage our differentiated business model to add new and deepen existing customer and partner relationships, further scale our comprehensive product suite, enhance our programs and expand our markets and deliver best-in-class experiences centered around each customer's individual financing needs. Synchrony will increasingly attract new customers and forge more expansive relationships, support our partners' ability to grow through evolving market conditions and solidify our leadership position as the digital ecosystem of choice, all while driving consistent, high-quality growth at strong risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I would like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks very much. And thanks for all of the detail around the guidance and the performance. I think the -- Brian -- I guess, Brian Doubles, you talked a lot about some of the enhancements to your products. Maybe could you just amplify a little bit as to how you're thinking about Synchrony's role with your partners in this current environment? I mean, it seems like this is an environment in which you're -- and what I hear from the retailers that they're going to need your help more. Just talk a little bit about how to think about the things that you talked about that you're doing and how that's going to help Synchrony and the shareholders? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Moshe. Thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. I think our partners, in an environment like this, tend to lean on us even more heavily. It's -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there that we've all talked about in terms of consumer trends and behavior and what we can expect from inflation and just kind of the broad uncertainty around the macro environment. And so our partners look at us and they say, okay, what are we doing to drive sales? What are we doing to drive new accounts? And this is when they lean even more heavily on the rewards programs and the credit customers, we've talked about in the past, always is their best most loyal customer. And so in this kind of environment, this is where they really double down and have really constructive discussions around, should we be refreshing the valve prop, should we be doing more promotions, more offers, are there new capabilities and new products that we should be introducing? And we've had really great discussions with our partners, particularly around the multiproduct strategy. So the combination of being able to offer a revolving credit product and installment buy now pay later loan and how those products work together. And one of the things that, as you know, we've been very focused on in that multiproduct journey is creating an easy experience for the customer, but also a really easy experience for a partner. So how do you offer multiple products and use our data-driven analytics to make sure that the customer, their customer is getting the right product, the right offer at the right time. And I think in an environment that we're heading into, that becomes even more important. So going all the way back to our Investor Day, we talked about that strategy. We spent a lot of time on it, and I do believe still to this day that the multiproduct strategy is the winning one. And we're hearing that from our partners. They're highly engaged in it. And I think, over time, it's going to pay big dividends for Synchrony and all of our stakeholders. So thanks for the question. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And maybe just to flip this over to Brian Wenzel. As you kind of factor all of that into the financial aspects, where are the areas you think that this could kind of help either already embedded in that guidance or where it could -- things could be better as we go through 2023? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Moshe, for the question. As I think about it, that engagement really to drive the compelling value proposition and linkage to the customer can really drive, what I would say, spend probably above what you'd see either in retail sales or in the general economy. So that would help fuel a lower payment rate as well. So I think you can see upside to the asset of 8 to 10, if that gained a lot of traction in 2023. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Brian, maybe to just start on the loan growth guidance, can you maybe just unpack some of the drivers behind it. I think you mentioned 30 new business wins. Brian Wenzel, you talked about solving payment rates and also maybe expectations for purchase volume growth. And then I guess any color across which platforms you expect to drive the growth just given the robust growth you've seen along with shifting views on inflation? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So thanks for the question, Ryan. So I think as you think about our asset growth, there's two dynamics that come into play. One is, you will see a slowing payment rate. Now, again, we don't expect the payment rate for the entire business to get back to historical levels during 2023. So that is one that will help you from an asset perspective. But if you believe that the economy is going to get a little tougher, the headwind then becomes, will the consumer pull back on spending a little bit? So I think those two dynamics kind of play with each other and how we think about it. Again, if the economy doesn't -- is stronger than we think, again, I think -- I still think you'll see slowing payment rate, but you'll see stronger sales kind of going in and you could have upside in that scenario to the outlook. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe as my follow-up, Brian, your comments on the RSA dependent on the trajectory of credit. So maybe just to clarify, so we're talking about 4% to 4.5% this year, which is lower than the 4% to 4.5%. I think you talked about it in Investor Day, yet, we're still not back to normalized levels of credit until '24. So my question is, have the goalposts for the RSA move down? What are some of the moving pieces that would have driven that? And is it possible that we could be operating below the 4% level at some point? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks. First, Ryan, just to make sure we're on the same page. The guidance for full year 2023 is 4% to 4.25%. And again, I think you have a couple of things. One, you do have a little bit of the net interest margin coming down that plays through the RSA, #1, with the interest-bearing liabilities cost going up. Two, you have the increase in that charge-off rate kind of coming through. Three, you have a little bit of the OpEx piece coming through. And four, you have growth in the denominator with really receivables. So I think that plays through -- to the extent your question, can it operate below a 4% level? Yes, it can operate at 4% level, but that would be more dependent upon trajectory of net charge-offs and how much of that is offset through net interest margin. Again, given the timing of losses, we're sitting here mid-January, which we have pretty good visibility really through mid-July now. So there is an opportunity for it. Again, we've given you the guidance we think is the best estimate for 2023 as we sit here today. Operator : We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Can you talk a little bit about regulatory risk specifically around what the CFPB might do on late fees, any timing or kind of your updated thoughts? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So look, I think the timing that's been kind of speculated upon out there is pretty much in line with what we assume, which is we might know something here in the first quarter, but I think probably won't have an effective rule until late this year or early next year. So again, pretty much in line with our expectations. We're prepared for that. I think we've talked about in the past that about 60% or a little over 60% of our late fees sit in programs that have an RSA, so that's an offset. Obviously, we'll work with our partners on that. They have an incentive to help us offset the impact if there is one. So we're ready for it. We're preparing internally. We'll see what comes out. But I think we'll have some time between when we have some clarity and probably an effective rule, like I said, late this year or early next year. Donald Fandetti : Got it. And can you talk a little bit about the relative health of the low-end consumer versus prime, what you're seeing? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I think internally, we certainly talk about a K-shaped recovery. I think we're certainly seeing that out. I think, broadly, the consumer is still healthy. I think they still have savings. We're seeing really good spend patterns, great spend on our products, in particular. Last year was a record year in terms of purchase volume. So generally, we feel pretty good about the operating environment. With that said, clearly, there's uncertainty as we move throughout the year depending on inflation and where rates go. So we're watching that very carefully. Our credit teams are highly engaged, and they're monitoring the portfolio to see where we need to make some tweaks and adjustments along the way. I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything to that? Brian Wenzel : I think you covered it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Brian Wenzel, I wanted to dig into some of the commentary on credit quality. You mentioned you're assuming 4.2% unemployment rate, but the qualitative assumption is in the 5% range for the reserve rate. I'm just curious what kind of impact would there be to the charge-off rate if the unemployment rate reaches 5%? And then you mentioned -- or I guess, does this mean that there's no impact to the reserve rate if we migrate to the 5% unemployment? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. So the qualitative portion, which brings the unemployment, effective unemployment rate up to that, call it, 5% level, again, we look at claims. But that essentially says that in that environment, there probably wouldn't be any form of significant rate-related reserve increases. Again, for the impact in net charge-offs, there is a timing issue here that happens. So the unemployment rate have to move up pretty rapidly in the beginning part of the year to have a factor in the back half of the year, which would impact the net charge-off rate. So if that happens, you're probably more looking at some headwinds towards 2024 from a net charge-off basis, but again, you should have that reserve for in the short term. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. So really no change to the reserve rate, just timing on the charge-off rate? Brian Wenzel : Yes. I mean, obviously, we were most sensitive to unemployment claims. Obviously, there are other things in the economy that we are sensitive to, but that would be the biggest factor for us to have to relook at reserves. And again, I know there's a lot of questions on reserve rate dipping down. That's a seasonal factor that happens every fourth quarter because of the denominator. I mean we're up in absolute dollars from third quarter to fourth quarter. And again, you'd expect as your receivables come down in the first quarter, that rate to rise. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And just a follow-up question for Brian Doubles. Maybe you could just help us think about how you're managing the business as you're thinking about loan growth, obviously, very undecided on where the economy is going as a whole, I think. And then any flexibility you might have on expenses to the extent that we have a more adverse scenario? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. I mean, look, we've talked about this in the past that we try and manage the business really well through cycles. And we try and provide a level of consistency to our partners in terms of how we underwrite. And so if you look at the last couple of years, we're coming out of the absolute best credit environment we've ever seen in the history of the business. And we didn't take an opportunity to underwrite a lot deeper. And I think that's why you saw, again, I think, more consistent loan growth from us than maybe some others, and that's really important to our business. Because if we take an opportunity to really underwrite deeper and take approval rates up, then we know, at some point in the future, we're going to have to pull back on that. And we try really hard not to do that. Again, consistency is really important to our partners. So we feel pretty good about the guide for next year, the 8% to 10% growth. And we think that that's prudent. That's not -- that doesn't assume significant changes in how we're underwriting. Now clearly, if things change, and we see the macro environment play out differently than we're contemplating right now, then we'll go in, and we'll make some tweaks, and we'll make some adjustments. But we feel pretty good about the 8% to 10%. And look, I think the one thing on expenses, you've seen us be pretty disciplined over the years. We had some opportunity last year to make some incremental investments. We did that. Really happy with the return and the payback on those investments, but we stay really disciplined there. And if we head into a tougher environment in '23 or '24, then certainly that's an area that we'll look to pull back on if we have to. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : My question is relating to capital and capital distribution for 2023. As we think about ending the year at 12.8%, I guess this is a two-part question. #1, does your buyback trajectory get impacted by the macroeconomic uncertainty, even though your receivables growth is set to slow in '23? And secondarily, is this -- is there an amount of cushion that management wants to hold against that 11% target, not necessarily for macro uncertainty, but for potential opportunity use in terms of purchases in case those arise, portfolio purchases in case those arise? Brian Wenzel - CFO: Yes. Thanks, Erika. So to your first question on the macroeconomic environment, right now, we're going through the early stages of developing our capital plan that we'll submit to the Federal Reserve in the latter part of March. So we go through that. With that capital plan, we run a number of different loss stresses and severe loss stresses in the idiosyncratic stresses in order to inform us really of what the range of outcomes are and how comfortable we feel with the environment. And again, as we said, throughout 2022, we feel very comfortable in the environment continuing on the capital plan that we laid out and submitted to the Fed last March and got approved in April. So we will use that to inform it. Again, during the year, we go through multiple stress scenarios. So we continue to feel good even under a stress scenario that the targets and the environment that we will continue to operate with a very good capital plan. So we'll do that to inform us. With regard to the level of capital, 11% is our target. Now the first thing to remind you and others of is we have to continue to fully develop our capital stack right through incremental Tier 1 through a preferred or -- and then obviously through Tier 2, whether that be sub debt or incremental preferred. So we have to continue to develop the capital stack to even be able to achieve the Tier -- the CET1 target. And then secondarily, I think every company operates with a little bit of operating range. The real positive part of our business, Erika, is that we generate a lot of capital each year, which we employ back in. And obviously getting down to 12.8%, the growth that we've anticipated when we talked to you back in October, 12%, we came in at 15%. So we're able to fund that growth, and that's really, we think, very attractive returns that will continue to generate capital as we move into '23 and beyond. So yes, there is some type of operating range. But again, the target also has a buffer to it, so you can most certainly go through that buffer a little bit if you wanted to do an acquisition. So that's not a floor, it's just a range in which we operate with, and we'll continue to try to deploy capital in a manner that's in the best interest of our stakeholders. Erika Najarian : And my second question is a follow-up to an earlier question about the reserve. I just wanted to clarify, fully understand the comments on the trajectory of losses from here. However, on the reserve, if we did end up with an unemployment rate at the end of the year that is closer to 5% versus 4.2%, I just wanted to make sure I understood this correctly, will there be an increase in the reserve rate or -- that's more significant? Or does the qualitative take care of any potential increases from that 4.2% baseline? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Erika, and I'll try to be clear here. The 4.2% is the baseline, which we take from Moody's. Effectively, when we run through the model, you're probably more like 4.5%. There are qualitative overlays that bring it effectively to 5% right? Or closer to 5%? So in theory, if you were to hit that, there should not be rate related provisioning. It should just be growth-related provisioning at that point. It's only if your outlook changed above 5%, which you would anticipate more rate-related increases. Operator : We'll take our next question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : In your press release, you noted that you had added or renewed 25 programs, including Lowe's, which has historically been one of the largest partners that you have. Can you just talk a little bit about, are you starting to push some of these renewals past 2025, which I know you had a lot of them locked in through 2025? And what's the competitive environment for these renewals today? Brian Doubles : Yes. So look, first, I would say that we're always looking to renew where we can at attractive terms for us and the partner. So the teams that we have on the ground sitting with our partners every day, you come across things where it makes sense to add some years to the deal investments we want to make, changes in valve prop, et cetera. So our teams are out there every day, finding ways to renew in ways that benefit our partners and benefit us. So we're thrilled to extend with Lowe's. They're one of our oldest clients. I think this extension will take us over 50 years, which is pretty incredible when you think about it. I would say, competitively, just more broadly, it's still competitive, very competitive environment. But I do think, as you start to head into periods of uncertainty like we're heading into now, you do start to see the competition get even more disciplined. And we all know and appreciate that we're not going to be operating at half of our targeted loss rate like we saw in the last couple of years, and you start to see that discipline work its way into the competitive dynamics. So I think that's good. We're a very disciplined bidder in these processes, and it's nice to see that kind of happen across the industry. So we feel really good about how we're positioned. I think in times like this, back to the earlier conversation, you're really competing on capabilities. And that, combined with good price discipline across the industry, is a good thing for us. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : One question to follow-up on something you mentioned in the prepared remarks. Normalization, you're seeing migrate into prime and super prime, I think I heard you right there. And I just wanted to understand if you were just talking there about the payment rate normalization? Or are you also talking about normalization in delinquencies and your net charge-off outlook? Maybe you could unpack what you meant a little bit more, if you don't mind? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So as Brian mentioned earlier, not many will talk about it, but there is, what I would say, a more K-shape recovery or we're seeing it, where the lower end consumer has been normalizing at a faster rate both, I'd say, from a payment rate behavior standpoint as well as a delinquency and charge-off standpoint. And as you continue to move away from the pandemic and stimulus, you begin to see the other cohorts, which is the prime and super prime, which had already started to normalize, continue to add normalization trends. I think the important part for us, Betsy, is as we take a step back and think about the entire portfolio for a second, if you looked at historical 30-plus and 90-plus-day delinquencies to pre-pandemic levels and applied it to our balances as you step through this year, what you'd see is a very linear normalization of delinquencies for us. And again, that's really the bottom end normalizing a little bit quicker. And now you're starting to see the top end. So -- but if you look at that linear pace beginning in the first quarter last year, I mean, we're about 80% of our pre-pandemic delinquencies and it's moved about 10 percentage points each quarter. So we're not seeing an acceleration in normalization. It just kind of is flowing through and that's on top of a larger balance, but it is normalizing in a manner in which we expected. But again, there is a little bit of a K-shaped recovery where we're starting to feel -- again, moving back, all our vintages from '20 on are performing better than our vintages in 2018. So we feel good that the normalization that we're expecting is happening on a path that we expect. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And that was -- part of the follow-up was around the vintages. So your vintages '20, '21, '22, pretty similar. And I guess the underlying question here is, as the performance is coming in relative to what you had pre-pandemic, how much more room is there for opening up the credit box or pulling in incremental loan growth? Brian Wenzel : Yes. I mean, if you break it apart for a second, Betsy, the '20 vintage and obviously, the early part of 2021, that's performing the best, right, because that's when we put in refinements at start of the pandemic because no one knows what's going to happen. Latter part of '21 and '22 performing between that vintage and 2018. So I think, in all cases, they're doing better, but again, they're slightly different under different underwriting standards. I don't envision, and Brian talked about this, the consistency that we have both in underwriting for origination, but account management that we're going to use that as a growth lever. I think we have a really diverse and attractive set of partners, so we get spend across a multitude of different verticals and categories. And then when you look at the fact that we're really having -- have compelling value propositions and are aligning to our most loyal customers at our partners, we don't have to use credit or growth engine as opposed to others. So I don't envision us using credit and opening up the credit box from here forward. Right now, what we're doing is we're making modest refinements when we see things that concern us, but we're not doing anything across the board because we don't see it across the board in our portfolio. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : I just wanted to follow up on some of the capital questions. If we did see a rapid increase in unemployment from a base rate of 3.5% to roughly 5% or maybe somewhere around that level as we approach year-end '23, I mean would you start to consider your capital levels to have already embedded that type of unemployment rate or those types of assumptions of economic deterioration just given the stress test? Or do you feel like you need to be a little bit more cautious given the outlook could change rapidly in that type of environment? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So first of all, thanks for the question, Kevin. When we think about our capital plan and the stress test we run, the unemployment rates that we use in those stress tests are significantly higher than 5%. So the 5% isn't concerning on its face value relative to capital and our capital levels. What really we would look at and our risk committee and the Board would look at is, is there a reduced visibility into the macroeconomic environment where you're concerned, or in the case -- or in the case where you're concerned about the level of net income being generated. That's where you would come back to saying, \"Hey, listen, should I think about capital differently?\" But remember, these stress test models are built under a very severe scenario. And as long as you're inside of that, you should be able to -- you continue on your capital plans and be able to weather it. That's why it is. There's a lot of buffers on top of the minimum requirements. So again, it'd be well north of 5% before we get concerned. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in regards to -- maybe a follow-up to that on M&A. I think you've mentioned that the valuations are finally normalizing. Are you seeing any attractive opportunities start to develop, whether it's portfolios or other acquisition potential targets given what we see out there today? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I think you're right. I mean we're finally seeing valuations check up pretty significantly in some areas that we're interested in. Our business development team has a very active M&A screen, so that's certainly something that we look at. You've seen us do small acquisitions where we can kind of leverage our scale, Allegro is a great example of that, pets Best is a great example of that, and we've grown those businesses very significantly since we acquired them. But we're a very disciplined buyer as well. Those were very modest in terms of the capital outlay, but we saw a lot of future growth and earnings potential. Those are the things that we like to do. And so if we can do more acquisitions like that, we'd certainly look to do that, but we're a very disciplined buyer when it comes to allocating capital to M&A. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : I guess first one is just on the NIM. You talked about deposit durations changing and so forth. Maybe can you just detail to us, is the shift in deposit prices mostly over what your outlook is there? And any characteristic of kind of the duration of deposits now versus where it has been? Brian Wenzel : Yes, thanks for the question, John. So I will deal with the latter part of the question first. So yes, we have seen an extension of the duration a little bit. People have rotated into CDs and we see people into, call it, that 18 month, 19 month duration. So it\u2019s split out a little bit, I wouldn\u2019t say materially. With regard to pricing as we move forward, I mean obviously when we gave the NIM guidance here, what we saw in 2022 was really a change in the landscape, right? You had a lot of people trying to manage betas in the beginning part of 2022 and then when they fell at the outflow of deposits during the year, got more aggressive with regard to price. I think you saw a lot of that happen in the latter part of the year. It's been very stable now. So our outlook includes deposit betas getting a little bit worse than they have been from here, particularly on the CDs. So again, this is going to be something that we're really going to watch relative to the Fed's actions at the next couple of meetings and what their guidance is with regard to the terminal rate that they have out there. But we plan for in this guidance to have betas deteriorate in 2023. John Hecht : Okay. That's helpful. And then a second question, maybe can you characterize -- you have some traditional partners, traditional retail partners like Lowe's and so forth and then digital platforms like Amazon and PayPal. Is there anything worth noting about the general trends in the different types of platforms and how that might manifest itself over the course of '23? Brian Doubles : Yes. Well, so obviously, we serve a very broad range of partners, as you indicated. And clearly, you saw really strong growth in Digital, strong growth in Health & Wellness. We would expect that to continue. I'll tell you where you see the biggest differences, John, is actually in how we engage with those partners. And our solutions inside of those partners differ quite a bit. Venmo and PayPal is a great example where we're completely integrated through our API architecture. And if you're inside of the PayPal or Venmo app, you don't know if it's something that we built or something that PayPal built. It is really seamless to the customer. And that's really important. And I think that really helps make that experience a good one for the customer and helps us drive growth over the long term. And you compare and contrast that with what we're trying to do in the one-to-many space like with Clover and other solutions where we want to make it really easy for our smaller partners to leverage the financial products that we have, and we have to do that by building it once and then scaling it across the enterprise. So you really run the gamut from highly customized, fully integrated API architecture to a one-to-many solution, which just makes it really easy for our partners to offer our financing products. So that's where you see the biggest difference between our partners and the partner set that we have today. I'll tell you, at any given time, you're going to have some partners that are doing really well and just crushing it, and you're going to have some partners that are maybe struggling a little bit. As I said earlier, heading into uncertain times like this, the credit program becomes even more important, and that's consistent across the board. So heading into an environment like this, we feel like we're really well positioned to help our partners succeed. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : I just want to talk a little bit more about the reserve rate outlook. End of the quarter, 10.3%, day 1 was 9.9% There was a suggestion that it will sort of trend back towards 10% over time, roughly in line with day 1 levels. I think what that implies to me is that as we've gone through the learning process on the CECL models versus day 1, that there has not been a material evolution in terms of sort of loss expectations that the reserve rates will sort of, on an apples-to-apples basis, be consistent with day 1. Is that the right way to think about things? And can we just put that in the context of the normalization over the next 18 months? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Rick. So I think if you looked at the assumptions that went into the day 1 CECL model versus the assumptions that are in the model today, they're very close to each other. So I do think that you're in a position where there's not a significant difference right now. Where there is a difference is the macroeconomic overlays that we have in here that are much more significant than what they were on day 1. So as that macroeconomic environment clears, right, either through the losses or through the fact that we were more conservative or things didn't play out the way we thought, you're going to begin to migrate back towards that day 1 level. Now remember, in CECL, at the end of the day, you forecast out for a reasonable and supportable period, right, that you have losses, and then you migrate to your mean. So at the end of the day, that mean hasn't changed for us and our expectations. I mean, obviously, I'd like to say we had a normal period during CECL, but unfortunately, over the last two-plus years, we have not. So again, we'll revisit at some point in the future what the mean loss rate is. But again, that does play into the fact that you will ultimately migrate and they should come back in line absent mix. Richard Shane : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And I think, like everybody, we're all exhausted of living through unprecedented times and returning to normal would be nice. Brian Wenzel : I 100% agree with you, Kevin. Brian Doubles : Agree with that. Brian Wenzel : Rick, sorry, Rick. Operator : This concludes Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you.",

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today Synchrony reported strong first quarter results, including net earnings of $601 million or $1.35 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3%, and a return on tangible common equity of 23.2%. Once again, the power of Synchrony's differentiated business model, match with the continued health of the consumers we serve, delivered consistent growth across our diversified set of partners and products. On a core basis, we opened 5.2 million new accounts, grew average active accounts by 8%, and drove $42 billion in purchase volume, the highest ever for a first quarter. This milestone was achieved with results across each of Synchrony's five platforms, highlighting the strength of our diversified model. Health and wellness purchase volume grew 19% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account. In diversified value purchase volume increased 16% driven by strong out-of-partner spend, strong retailer performance, and penetration growth. The 10% growth in digital purchase volume was broad-based, reflecting growth in active accounts and strong customer engagement. In lifestyle, purchase volume increased 9%, reflecting higher transaction values, primarily in outdoor and luxury. And in home and auto, purchase volume increased 6% due to strength in our commercial products and higher transaction values in furniture and home specialty. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 41% of total purchase volume and increased 22% on a core basis, reflecting continued strong response to several new value propositions. Synchrony's record first quarter purchase volume growth is a testament to the utility of our flexible financing solutions, the compelling value propositions we offer, and the continued resilience of our customers as they navigate the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates. We regularly monitor our customers' needs and their financial health through our billions of real-time transaction data. Our insights continue to show only minor variations in average transaction value and frequency across spend categories. At a high level, average transaction values and frequency increased in the quarter across both in-store and out-of-partner spend, reflecting the continued impact from ongoing inflationary pressure. However, growth in average transaction value slowed in March, possibly reflecting the early impact of lower tax refunds. More broadly, the data suggests that our customers are actively managing their budgets as the macro backdrop evolves. We also continue to see some minor seasonal category shifts within our auto partner spend, though the relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary spend remains essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, across the spectrum of credit segments we serve, our highest credit grade borrowers continue to shop more frequently and spend more when they do. In the sign of their relative health, the transaction frequency of super prime customers in certain platforms grew at rates lasting during the summer of 2022. Lower credit grade borrowers are shopping somewhat less often. This trend has remained relatively stable since the fourth quarter and follows the payment behaviors of this credit segment, which migrated toward pre-pandemic levels in the second half of last year. In terms of payment behavior, we also continue to see normalizing payment rates across age cohorts and credit bands, which is to be expected as consumers spend their accumulated savings and begin to revolve their balances. Based on the external deposit data we monitor, consumer savings levels continued to decline through March 31, though at a slower pace than we saw through most of 2022.  Average consumer deposit balances declined 2% this quarter, though they remain 10% above 2020. As accumulated savings continue to decline at this modest pace, we expect borrower payment revolve trends to further normalize. This, in turn, will drive continued growth in our interest-bearing loan balances, the return of delinquency and credit loss metrics to pre-pandemic levels and better optimize risk-adjusted margins for our business. Synchrony's business model is designed to support our customers and partners through changing macro conditions, and in particular, a more normalized operating environment than we've seen since the start of the pandemic. As this progression back to historical levels continues, we are managing the business prudently for the long term while watching trends. With that view and given the stable labor markets and the relative strength of the consumers' balance sheet, we remain positive on the state of the consumer today. Our confidence comes from our decades of experience managing through economic cycles. This experience delivers a model that sustainably serves all of our stakeholders. At the crux of it all is our diversified partner portfolio and product suite, which gives us the tools to deliver consistent, high-quality products and results throughout varying environments. We continue to build on these strengths in the first quarter, as highlighted by our recently announced product launch and the addition of renewal of more than 15 partners. In particular, we launched the Synchrony Outdoors card, which was in direct response to customer and partner demand in our powersports business. Serving as an example of how our platform realignment is enabling Synchrony to rethink how we deliver for partners and customers. Synchrony has long provided valuable installment lending solutions for powersports equipment. However, in this market, which is projected to reach $131 billion by 2028, there are significant purchases that occur after the initial purchase, such as accessories, parts, garments, fuel, service, and warranties that were not served by the installment lending model we have traditionally offered in powersports. Our dedicated platform team with combined experience across partners and products identified this opportunity to meet our customers' demand and drive still greater loyalty for dealers. Turning to our health and wellness platform. Synchrony extended relationships with the largest and second-largest dental associations this quarter, solidifying CareCredit as the dental financing solution of choice. More specifically, we announced a 10-year partnership extension with the American Dental Association, distinguishing CareCredit as the only ADA endorsed patient financing solution.  This endorsement, which dates back to 2001, includes special features and offers for more than 159,000 dentist members and their patients. We also extended our 20-year relationship with the Academy of General Dentistry, remaining the exclusive patient financing solution for the benefits program of the academy's more than 35,000-member dentists. These continued long-standing partnerships underscore the unique value that our integrated care credit offering delivers to both the providers and patients we support. And finally, we announced renewals across an array of partners this quarter in our home and auto platform, including with Havertys and LoveSac. Synchrony's ability to grow and win new partners as well as diversify our products, programs and markets enables us to drive greater flexibility, utility and value for our customers and partners alike, while also enhancing the resiliency of our business. In summary, I'm proud of the many ways in which Synchrony continues to meet our customer wherever they are looking to make a purchase, a payment or a deposit, as their needs and priorities continue to evolve, Synchrony is ready. Ready to deliver flexibility, value and seamless experiences through more solutions and more locations, along with our industry-leading partners. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance highlighted the continued strength of the consumer paired with the power of our diversified sales platforms, compelling value propositions, and prudent financial position. Consumers continue to deepen their engagement with our products. On a core basis, ending loan receivables growth of 16% was fueled by 11% stronger purchase volume along with 3% higher spend per active account. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.1 billion as the growth in loan receivables and an increase in loan receivable yields drove 15% higher interest and fees. This was partially offset by the impact of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of 2022. On a core basis, interest and fees increased 23% reflecting the impact of credit normalization as payment behavior trends toward pre-pandemic levels. Pay rate for the first quarter when adjusting for last year portfolio sales was 16.7%, approximately 85 basis points lower than last year and approximately 150 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic historical average. First quarter net interest margin of 15.2% declined 58 basis points, primarily reflecting the higher impact of interest rates on our funding cost, partially offset by better yield trends. Loan receivables yield declined 97 basis points and contributed 83 basis points to net interest margin. Incremental liquidity portfolio yield also contributed an additional 54 basis points. These gains were more than offset by higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 219 basis points to 3.43% and reduced net interest margin by 179 basis points. And our mix of interest-earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately 16 basis points as we built liquidity to fund anticipated growth. RSAs of $917 million in the first quarter or 4.10% of average loan receivables. The $187 million decline from the prior year reflected the impact of portfolio sold in the second quarter of 2022, and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. RSAs provide important alignment with our partners and continue to function as designed by providing a buffer to the financial results of the company and supporting greater stability in our returns. This was highlighted in the first quarter as RSA provided a buffer to increased net charge-offs and higher funding costs. Provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion for the quarter, which reflected higher net charge-offs and a $285 million reserve build. The build included consideration for the potential macroeconomic effects of industry credit contraction and the potential impact on consumers, though we do not see any related impacts in our delinquency performance today. Other income decreased $43 million driven primarily by higher loyalty costs as well as the impact from investment gains and losses, partially offset by higher debt cancellation income. Other expenses increased 8% to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs, operational losses, and technology investments. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 35% compared to 37.2% last year. In total, Synchrony generated first quarter net earnings of $601 million or $1.35 per diluted share delivering a return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible common equity of 23.2%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. We continue to see credit metrics performing in line with or better than 2019 performance as credit normalization continues at a measured pace. Delinquency rates remain at approximately 80% of pre-pandemic levels and recent vintages continue to perform better than those of 2018 or 2019. The continued tapering of accumulating consumer savings is contributing to a slow moderation of payment behavior towards prepay anemic levels, -- as we noted last quarter, the trend of normalization has gradually shifted into higher credit grades, where balances tend to be larger. As a result, we saw payment rate declines versus prior quarter of approximately 30 basis points while delinquencies and losses increased in line with our expectation. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.81% compared to 2.78% last year or 4.92% in the first quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.87% versus 1.30% in the prior year or 2.51% in the first quarter of 2019. And our net charge-off rate increased to 4.49% from 2.73% last year, still approximately 100 basis points below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.44%, up 14 basis points from 10.30% in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase in the reserve rate primarily reflected the impact of the additional reserve discussed earlier and seasonally lower receivables. The allowance also reflects a previously announced $294 million reduction of reserves for troubled debt restructurings recorded through equity as we adopted updated accounting guidance. This guy has reduced our reserve coverage rate by approximately 30 basis points for the quarter. In the quarter, Synchrony's management of funding, capital, and liquidity remained a source of strength. We set and maintain appropriate target levels of common equity, liquidity, and reserves. We generally manage our funding strategy to be interest rate neutral and to minimize duration risk. And the vast majority of our liquidity portfolio is in cash and short-term U.S. treasuries, largely maturing in under one year. So as depositors across the country navigate the uncertainty of several bank failures and pronounced deposit flows during mid-March, Synchrony Bank was well positioned as a reliable source of stability for both our customers and our business. Our stable direct-to-consumer deposit base is largely insured, with no concentration in geographic areas or high-balance accounts. Our outage depositor has banked with us for approximately five years, and nearly 80% of our deposit balances are more than three years old. The foundation of this loyalty is Synchrony Bank's award-winning platform and industry-leading customer satisfaction scores, depositors are attracted to our seamless digital first experience as well as our competitive rates.  In fact, as customers sought to either balance exposure to their banks or remix their balances to take advantage of available FDIC insurance limits during the last three weeks of March, Synchrony Bank saw a net deposit inflow of nearly $700 million as we generated double-digit account growth sequentially. This contributed to first quarter deposit growth of 17% versus last year and $2.7 billion sequentially to reach $74.4 billion. At quarter end, over 91% of Synchrony Bank direct deposits were fully insured. And looking at April trends, Synchrony Bank activity has returned to more seasonal flows, highlighted by continued growth in new accounts and deposits. Our deposit base provides a strong foundation for our business, representing 83% of our total funding, and is complemented by our securitized and unsecured debt, which represented 7% and 10% of our funding, respectively, and increased by $1.7 billion versus the prior year. This increase included the issuance of 10-year subordinated debt, an important milestone as we continue to more fully develop our capital stack, and reach target capital levels. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $21.7 billion or 20.2% of our total assets, up 148 basis points from last year as we grew deposits and prefunded our projected loan receivables growth. Moving on to discuss Synchrony's capital position. As we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint banking agencies, Synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics in January, and we will continue each year until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Further, the TDR reserve reduction mentioned earlier was recognized net of tax and equity adding approximately 25 basis points to our capital ratios. We ended the first quarter at 12.5% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 250 basis points lower than last year's level of 15%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.3% of the CECL transition rules compared to 15.9% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 180 basis points to 15.4%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.5% compared to 24.5% last year. Synchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns in the first quarter. In total, we returned $500 million to shareholders through $400 million of share repurchases and $100 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $300 million. Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan. We'll also continue to seek opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock. Finally, please refer to Slide 12 of our presentation for more detail on our full-year 2023 outlook. Overall, first quarter purchase volume came in ahead of our expectations, which, when combined with slightly faster payment rate normalization than anticipated, deliver stronger receivables growth for the quarter. As a result, we now expect any receivables to grow by 10% or more by year-end, although we anticipate paying rates ending the year well above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect net interest margin of 15% to 15.25% this outlook reflects the benefit of favorable trend in our deposit betas and payment rates during the first quarter, balanced by anticipated impacts of the broader market uncertainty. These potential impacts include holding higher liquidity levels in anticipation of growth funding needs as well as competitive dynamics within the industry that could lead to higher betas. Meanwhile, credit normalization continues on track in line with our expectations in terms of both our delinquency and loss trends. As a reminder, we expect delinquencies to continue to rise and approach pre-pandemic levels by midyear. Net charge-offs should follow a similar but lagged progression relative to the normalization and delinquencies. Lost dollars will rise through 2023, but will not reach fully normalized levels to approximately six months following the peak and delinquencies. As such, we continue to expect the net charge-off rate for the full year 2023 of 4.75% to 5%, and that our portfolio will not reach an annual underwriting loss target range of 5.5% to 6% until 2024. Given our unchanged outlook for net interest margin and net charge-offs, the RSA remains unchanged between 4% and 4.25% of average loan receivables. We remain committed to delivering operating efficiency for the full year with a target of approximately $1.125 billion in operating expenses per quarter. In sum, Synchrony's model is built for sustainable performance at strong risk-adjusted returns as we grow to meet the needs of our customers, our partners, and our shareholders. As conditions normalize, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial operating targets. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony's track record of execution reflects our differentiated approach to serving our customers and our partners and the consistency that generates for our stakeholders. Over decades, through economic cycles and waves of innovation, we prioritize strategies that deliver sustainable, long-term growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. So, as I look forward, I am confident in our ability to continue to adapt and deliver across environments, and I'm excited for the opportunities we see to deliver on our objectives in the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn and open up the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks, and thanks to Brian and Brian. The -- I guess the first question I'd like to ask is, given that you're now seeing this normalization of profitability as you're going through this process of losses normalizing. And you do have the current economic outlook with the variability around it. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about growth in new accounts and the discussions that you're having with your partners both about your ability to continue to grow and their -- how they're thinking about the RSA that they receive? Brian Wenzel : Good morning, Moshe. So, the conversation with the partners that they are most certainly looking to us to help drive them new customers and to grow sales. The competitive retail environment is very difficult for them right now. And I think the ability for us to bring a multiproduct facet to them is very enticing now. We just continue to work with them about what the right placement is of products. And when we think about the profitability, we are returning back to normal levels. Well, certainly, the funding cost is higher than what we traditionally have seen historically, and they understand that. The conversations around the RSA, they do recognize that they benefited over the last couple of years with an outside of the market and they're willing to participate. That's the economic arrangement we've had and none of them are really pushing back. They will certainly are cautious and want to understand how credit is developing, whether or not we're going to take actions at some point, which may impact their sales. But -- but for the most part, they've been supportive and really looking for us to continue to drive volume for them and new customers. I don't know, Brian, do you want to add anything to that? Brian Doubles : Yes. I would just add, Moshe, we talked about this in the past that, I think in periods of uncertainty, and clearly, we're in a somewhat uncertain period right now. This is when we see our partners engage even more in the card programs and that's great for us. The level of engagement, I would say, across big partners and small partners has never been higher than it is right now. They're very engaged. They are working with us on really trying to understand what the consumer is doing, how they're going to behave over the next 12, 24 months. And we're seeing great engagement in the multiproduct strategy as well, that's something that we anchored on a couple of years ago, a lot of momentum across the business on it. And I think as partners are kind of taking a step back and trying to figure out the macroeconomic environment and the consumer trends, they're also rethinking the financial products that they offer and kind of rationalizing their point of sale. And I think that definitely plays to our strengths. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And Brian Wenzel, you said that your margin outlook talked to be considered an industry environment that could lead to higher betas, it seems like from the actions that you've taken and others and the deposit kind of inflows that it seems like the opposite is happening, I guess, maybe could you just talk a little bit in more detail about what you're actually seeing and what it would take for things to either get better or worse from a deposit beta standpoint from here? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So, as we entered the year, we anticipated our betas to rise from last year. There was a shift in the end of last year were got highly competitive, particularly with some of the regional banks. So, when you looked at our betas at the end of last year, they were roughly low to mid-70s on high-yield savings and around 80% on CDs. As we came into 2023, we anticipated probably a 10- to 15-point beta rise in high-yield savings and probably 20 basis points or essentially 100% or more data on CDs, right? That's how we came into the year. I'd say the market for the most part since the third week of December through the end of the first quarter was very rational and the betas performed better than our expectation, right? So, if you look at betas now, they're probably mid-70s on savings and about 90 on CDs. Our outlook, though, Moshe, is what's baked into the NIM guidance is that we still go back to those original points where you're going to be mid-80s on high-yield savings and over 100 on CDs just because of the fact that there may be other banks who have seen deposit outflows may get more aggressive. Again, we haven't seen that yet, but that's what's in the outlook. So hopefully, that doesn't develop, which would give us some potential upside. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks, so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi. Good morning, guys. Brian, maybe just start on the allowance, given the accounting change. Can you maybe just remind us what's included from a macro perspective? And then second, you talked about normalization still being 20% below and you gave us a nice progression on the charge-offs. But I guess, given the backdrop plus the amount of growth you're anticipating, how do you think about delinquencies and charge-offs leveling off versus the risk of overshooting just given the impact of growth math and the softening macro backdrop? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Let me try to unpack that question, Ryan. Good to talk to you this morning. So first, when you think about the TDR account change, this is one where we, like many others, have chosen retroactive treatment. So, there was a reduction to the reserve that went net of tax through equity on January 1. As we came into the quarter, the reserve is fundamentally two things. One, the seasonal pay down and purchase -- seasonal pay down was lower than our expect or lower than expectations. And then purchase volume was higher than our expectations, which gave us a greater asset position at the end of the quarter, which led to the growth-driven reserve provision. When you think about the components of what's in the reserve from a macroeconomic standpoint, effectively, what we have in -- when you look all the way through the baseline model through the qualitative reserves, our unemployment is effectively 6%. So isn't this reasonable forecastable period, if unemployment stays below 6%, we should not have rate-driven reserve provisions. Again, during this quarter, though, given the banking turmoil and the potential contraction of credit, we did add to the macroeconomic overlay to deal with the potential flow-through effects to consumer. As I think about it stepping forward, what I'd say is we expect really generally growth-driven reserves. I mean, provision increases, and that should be in line with what we thought about. That said, we still believe that we're going to trend downward over time as we move out through the end of the year and into next year down to that adjusted CECL day one reserve post. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thank you, for the color. And maybe just on capital, Brian, you noted that you're well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders, at 12.5%, you're obviously approaching the 11% target. Can you maybe just think about how you manage capital in this kind of environment given obviously pretty robust asset growth, but clearly, your potential recession being on the horizon plus getting closer to target. Maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes and how you're thinking about managing the capital base over an intermediate time frame? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Ryan, the thing I try to get -- try to convey is that when you run your loss stress testing models under the severe and idiosyncratic events, unemployment was up to 10%. So, in theory, you go through and you run those stresses. So, we look at -- even if you had some form of recession that came about in the short to medium term, in theory, your -- our capital provision and our buffers would be able to withstand that.  So, we don't necessarily look at that as something where we would sit back and say, we should stop or curtail some of the repurchases or the level of repurchases on it safe. So, the economic event is really baked into our capital forecast and our capital plan. As we think about the priorities, you hit it right. The first thing we think about is the organic growth of the company. Second is dividends. And third comes down to whether or not we have inorganic opportunities and/or share repurchases. So, some of the cadence that might come about over the next couple of years, are there assets that come available that we want to deploy capital into. But right now, again, we're going to continue to return shareholders to -- return capital to shareholders in line with what we've been doing historically and target down towards the 11%. Again, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that we do have to finish development of our preferred stack, but that's not necessarily something we need to do today. Ryan Nash : Thanks, for color. Operator : Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the RSA, at 4.1% in the quarter, I think that it was about 20 basis points lower than what consensus had. And as we think about normalizing credit for the rest of the year, should we expect the rest of the year to be at the lower end of the range that you gave us, Brian? Brian Wenzel : Good morning, Erika. So again, we gave you the range of 4% to 4.25%, it's going to really depend upon how net interest margin plays out, right, when you think about the funding cost of the business. Losses again, is in that same range as the 4.75% to 5%. So, it's really going to play really on how the deposit betas play through and how that -- the benchmark interest rates flow through to our partners, but we expect it to be in the 4% to 4.25%. Erika Najarian : Got it. And I hate to ask about '24, but a lot of investors are now thinking about credit sensitive financials and trough earnings in a recession, and expecting trough earnings to be occurring in 2024. So, as we think about the dynamics of your net charge-off dollars reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2024, the potential for Fed cuts potentially supporting your margin as you reprice deposits down.  How should your prospective and our investors think about the RSA in that environment, right? Because I think that as investors think about the step function higher in net charge-offs, is there a way for them to easily say, okay, here's a step function lower an RSA in a recessionary year. That's unique to your staff. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, let me just talk about credit for a second. We ended the quarter, if you look back at historical delinquency rates, we've been trending about 10 basis points a quarter up on the normalization curve. When we ended fourth quarter of '22 at roughly 80%. And we ended the first quarter of '23 or roughly between 75% and 77%. So, credit is normalizing in the way in which we expected and to stay on that trajectory. As you slide into '24, we expect the loss rate to back to our underwriting target at 5.5% to 6%. The other dynamics that play through, you're right, if you believe you go back to that type of environment, which would have a slightly normal -- higher or more normalized unemployment rate, you're then going to see your payment rate come back in line, which should give you a tailwind relative to interest and fees. But then we also expect the prime rate and the interest-bearing liabilities cost to come down. Those all kind of work. You have two effective tailwinds, headwind with net charge-offs, that goes -- all goes back through the RSA. So, when you think about that, you have pluses and minuses, there could be a period of time which we dip below 4% for a quarter or two, and then you should come back in line with what I would think the longer-term financial framework which we gave you, which is in that 4% to 4.25%. Erika Najarian : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Real one is just noticing that you've had a good migration towards more use of co-brand and dual card. Brian, you talked about kind of product expansion earlier in the call. I'm just wondering what given that migration, what are you seeing -- are you seeing any changes in customer activity that are worth noting? And is that tied to product expansion? Or are there other sources of that? Brian Doubles : Yes, John, I'll start and then ask Brian to add some color. I think the dual card co-brand strategy has been one that we've leaned on heavily over the last decade. And what we really like about it is the ability to migrate our best customers and our partner's best customers into a product that has world spend capabilities. And the way that they earn on that card typically gives them a reason to go back into the partner's store. So, we like the synergies there, and we are seeing above-average growth in dual card and world sales, which is great for us, great for our partners as well. Just taking a step back, as we think about the multiproduct strategy, it really is one that you can envision starting with at the kind of lower end of the spectrum, a secured card buy now pay later shorter-term installment loan migrating into a revolving product PLCC and then ultimately into a dual card or co-brand card.  We think that strategy is a winning one. We think that economically to us when we think about the risk and return profile that allows us to cater to a very wide cross-section in terms of our partners' customers. And so that's where I think we've seen a real change just in the last two or three years as we've been engaging with our partners on the multiproduct strategy, a lot of engagement, a lot of momentum there. And I think that over time, that's a winning strategy for us. And maybe, Brian, just to add a little color if there's any changes in terms of the... Brian Wenzel : Yes. So, remember, John, as we always talk about the customers that seek our cards out are the most loyal customers of our partners, right? So, they are engaged with that brand, want the value back in that brand. And when we look through to the categories of spend that we see particularly on the dual card, they're very consistent how they rank order and very sticky. So, like our world span category is bill pay.  If you think about top five, you have grocery in there, you have restaurants in there. Those are things in which are everyday type events, that are sticky and continuous. And when they're earning benefits back into a brand in which they like, they're going to continue to do that. So, when we look at transaction values and frequencies, it's remained relatively consistent, which goes back to the point where we -- we talked about dual card, when you think about some of the other brands that are in there that may not necessarily be dual card but have wide utility and some of our digital partners, we have a broad swath of this business that goes across multiset of categories. John Hecht : Okay. That's very helpful color. And then Brian Wenzel, I apologize if you gave some of this color on the prepared remarks, but any -- I know you kept your guidance for NIM, for instance, and RSAs, but is there any seasonal considerations we should think about those over the course of the next couple of quarters? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So again, there will be seasonal trends. Obviously, I think about charge-offs, you generally have a seasonal increase in the second quarter from charge-offs on an interest margin basis. We'll have some seasonality as we pre-fund some of the back-end of the year growth into the first quarter into the liquidity profile. So, you may see them come down and back up and charge-offs to be a little bit higher in the second quarter. But I think when you look at charge-offs, and it's important to note the pace of acceleration that I highlighted just a couple of minutes ago that we're still at 80% of historical delinquency levels. And when you look at the delinquency increases third quarter to fourth quarter and the fourth quarter to first quarter, they have slowed. So again, on a dollar basis, because signs up, you'll see it and receivables were a seasonal low in the second quarter, and then you'll see receivables grow and the loss rate kind of flatten out, maybe down back half of the year. John Hecht : And then anything with respect to NIM fluctuations just as a part of that question. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So, I tried to hit on that, I apologize, John. With regard, you'll see a little bit of downward pressure in the second quarter, and then comes back mainly for pre-funding for growth in the back half. And the only thing that I took back and say that could potentially be a tailwind is whether or not the betas that we're assuming do not come in the way we anticipate, so they're more favorable. So, the funding costs don't go up as much that could be a tailwind. John Hecht : Thanks, very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. Maybe to follow-up on Moshe's question previously. Obviously, the cycle is very different from previous ones. I'm just curious if the dislocation in the regional banking space and the implications of it working through the economy might be assisting and sort of rethinking how you guys are underwriting? I know you mentioned, Brian Doubles the slower spending in March and lower tax refunds. Can you just talk about those different dynamics and sort of how it's affecting the way you guys are thinking about underwriting? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. I'll start on this one, Sanjay. So, I think what's important, and we talk about this a lot, is that through what was really the best credit environment in the history of financial services in the last two years, we didn't really take an opportunity to underwrite a lot deeper. And that's important for us because consistency is really important to our partner. So, in times, really good times like we have the last couple of years, we don't underwrite a lot deeper. And that's really done in the hopes that when things get a little bit uncertain or a little bit worse that we don't have to pull back dramatically. That consistency is important to our partners and important to us. So, we're not at this point anticipating significant underwriting changes. We like how we're underwriting today. The consumer is still healthy. We're expecting charge-offs to normalize back into our target range next year. So, what we're seeing right now is still pretty comfortable in terms of the consumer trends. So not anticipating anything significant at this point. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then a follow-up is it sounds like a former partner of yours might be looking for change. I'm just curious of your appetite to take on large portfolios like that specific one. And obviously, the stock price is still very attractive here. I'm just considering -- thinking through the trade-offs here and sort of how you guys are looking at the outlook for portfolio acquisitions and such? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, nothing to share specifically on that situation. I just don't want to speculate there. We're not party to that, obviously. I would say that we've got a great relationship with Sam's Club going back 25-plus years, great alignment, great engagement, and momentum on that program, but nothing to really speculate on beyond that. I would say just kind of more generally, we're always in the market for large portfolio acquisitions, start-up opportunities. We've got a very active process, big team working on it. And so that's always of interest to us. What's important there though, as we've talked about in the past is you got to have really good alignment, you got to have the right balance of risk and return. And I think that's important, particularly in an environment like this where you're kind of heading into a period of uncertainty. So, we'll continue to stay very disciplined around risk and return. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I just want to dig in a little bit more on NIM. I understand the expectation on the forward look is it's going to bounce around, and I get that we're at the high end of the range right now on NIM. But I did want to understand a, what kind of rate outlook is baked into your NIM guide? And then b, if the mix shift is going to materially change as you look through this year from what it was in 1Q. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Good morning, Betsy. So, the answer to the first part of your question, we have a peak Fed funds rate of 5.25%. So, one more effective move from here. We do have some reductions again following the forward curve towards the latter part of the year. But that has, I'd say, a very small to any consequential effect on net interest margin for the full year. With regard to your second point as you kind of think about mix of the business, I don't think you'll see issues necessarily this year with regard to mix impact on net interest margin. Most certainly, over time, I think if you think about where the geography is, to the extent health and wellness continues to grow at a rapid pace.  And you see some of the businesses that are more promotional financing growth, you may see a shift in the revenue. Profitability is exactly the same, but maybe a shift out of NIM and the way it comes through our merchant discount -- merchant discount pricing, but that's not going to be a 2023 issue. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you spoke a little bit about loan growth and you did raise the guide from 8% to 10% to 10% plus. But at the same time, you've got in the reserving discussion, potential tighter lending standards from the industry. Could you just address how you're thinking about lending standards? And is that -- is the increase in the loan growth that you're looking for? I mean, I would assume it's within the credit box that you've got but maybe you could speak to what's driving that increase in loan growth and how your lending centers are playing into the outlook? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So, our underwriting today, again, we're always making some level of refinement really around partner channel performance and whether or not we're hitting the risk-adjusted returns. So, we're constantly looking at that, and our credit team is focused on it every day. We're not taking any broad-based actions because we do not see either on vintage level performance, the vintages since the start of the pandemic, they're performing better than '18 and '19. So, they are performing well. Again, Brian talked about the consistency of our underwriting. So, we didn't kind of come on and off the gas like many other issuers do. So, when we look at the stuff that we recently put on is performing at or better than what we saw pre-pandemic. The pre-pandemic book is performing consistent with how it kind of entered the pandemic.  So, we really don't see any broad-based deterioration when you look at entry rates and flows, it's not something where we are taking what I'd say, broad-based actions, opening the box or closing the box. Again, we don't use that as really a growth lever, like some insurers do, but for us, it's going to be much more consistent. With regard to how you think about the loan growth being higher, there's two things. One, we are seeing greater utilization of our cards by consumers, and we are seeing a slightly favorable payment rate. Those two things are driving -- what was the growth in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue somewhat through the back half of -- or for the remainder of 2023. So that's how I think about the loan growth being up. Again, what you may see if you -- if the economy does slow faster, what you should see or you may see is payment rate to slow faster and then you can see purchase volume taper down a little bit. Now again, I think you have to look at dollars here because I think last year, you're going to start comping the post-Omicron period, which is a tougher comp for all of us. So again, I think about it as being more adoption and utilization of our cards. And then two, payment is driving the growth on underwriting. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good morning. On the charge-off expectation, I know you kept it unchanged at 4.75% to 5%. And you don't expect it to reach the more normalized level until '24. Can you just give us a little more granularity on where you are seeing mounting stress and in what product areas and vintages specifically? Is it still the more recent vintages and the continued expansion across income cohorts? I believe you mentioned that earlier, but I just want to get a little more clarity on that. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. I wouldn't use the term stresses. I don't think we are seeing stresses in there. I think what we're seeing is the return to more pre-pandemic levels. And I think what you start to see is in the credit grades of the prime and super prime customers, they were well below historical averages, mainly because they benefited during the pandemic period, whether they got stimulus, lower spending, lower ability to spend. And now they're using up some of that accumulated savings, they are returning back to what I'd say, pre-pandemic levels of performance. That is on performance on payment rate, performance on spending, and performance as entry into delinquency and rolls through. So, I wouldn't say it's stress. I'd just sit there and say, you see these consumers migrating back to past behaviors. And that's across the portfolio. That's not necessarily in one set of vintages or another. So that's how I kind of think about the credit development with regard to that. With regard to delinquency performance, again, what you're seeing right now is a very favorable entry rate into delinquency, you're seeing fairly good front-end collections. The back-end collections are pretty weak because you don't have the normal flows through delinquency yet. What you'd expect to see as inter-rates rise a little bit, your front-end seats to maybe deteriorate a little bit and the back-end seats to rise as you put more volume through the collection channels. But we had not started to see that. We have not seen that yet in our performance, but that's what we expect to materialize over the coming -- remainder of 2023 and into 2024. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. And then just getting back to Ryan Nash's question on the reserve, just to confirm again that the addition this quarter was more growth-driven and rate driven. And as you look at the outlook if the unemployment rate remains as in your expectation at that below the 6% level, you would expect a migration lower in the reserve ratio from here? Is that correct? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So, the way -- again, just to be clear, the majority of the reserve for the quarter is growth driven. There was an addition to the macroeconomic overlay that said, listen, you have banking turmoil there could be a contraction of credit some of these institutions, which will then have an effect in the economy and on to the consumer. So, we provided for that. Again, the majority of it was growth driven because the assets came in higher than our expectation. I think as long as we continue to progress on the macroeconomic assumptions, those qualitative reserves unwind and offset some of the growth-driven provisions that we'll have. So -- but again, if we track to our macroeconomic assumptions, there should not be rate-driven provisioning going forward just to be growth-driven. Operator : Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks, so much for taking my question. I guess when you think about the pacing of net charge-offs, given what you've talked about and then your assumption on the reserve, if you think about timing of wherever your peak loss rate occurs and the potential for reserve releases. I know you've talked about this, but is there a period of time where you decide, hey, it's still cloudy out there. We can't release reserves just yet and charge-offs are rising? Or do you think you release reserves as charge-offs are rising the entire time. I know it's a tough one. I got a follow-up. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Hi. Good morning, Dom. What's interesting about CECL is, in theory, what it tells you is if you see your peak losses inside of your reasonable supportable period, in theory, you can begin to release reserves prior to peak losses, which I think is very uncommon for the industry, but that's a byproduct of CECL. So, there could be a situation where we released reserves, even though we have not gotten to big losses because you'll hit the peak and then begin to come down in that forecasting period. We haven't seen that yet. We don't contemplate that in how we look at 2023, and we'll have to get back to you as we think about 2024 and how delinquency plays out for the remainder of this year. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thank you, so much. And then just we haven't talked about the efficiency ratio just yet on the call. And obviously, you guys are seeing some pretty hefty really nice core efficiency ratio gains year-over-year. I'm wondering about as you think about over the longer term, you've kind of set up some goals, how kind of the changes in macro environment that you see today included in some of your reserves, has that changed where the efficiency ratio trend could go by any chance? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. No, great question. We don't think the current environment changes our long-term framework getting down to that 32% to 33%, which is, I think, best in class when it comes to efficiency ratio. I think one of the things that Brian and Margaret did during the pandemic, they drove us to drive digital efficiencies in our collections and in-sourcing of other things that drove productivity. Again, the efficiency ratio was negatively impacted with the decline in interest and fee yield. But again, as we drive those efficiencies and get operating leverage, and Brian and I are committed to delivering operating leverage as we step through the periods, that should bring us back into that long-term framework. And again, if the macro environment gets tougher, I think the investments we've made digitally with regard to our collection activities, but across our entire business, we'll help to bolster that where we can control expenses. This would be a very different play than what happened back in a great financial crisis, where you do a lot about that and just started calling people that that's not what would happen even under any form of recession. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks, so much. Operator : We have time for one last question. That question will come from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Great. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. First one, Brian Doubles, maybe just a clarification. I don't believe I heard or read anything in your releases regarding the status of your capital plan. that was submitted last month. Is there any update you can provide on kind of status, timing, and perhaps directional help on magnitude? Brian Wenzel : Thanks, David. Why don't I take that question? We did submit our capital plan. It went through our same process. We actually included some additional stresses given some of the developments in the first quarter into that capital plan, it was approved by our Board, and we submitted it to our regulators on target with past years.  Again, they go through that and provide what we believe will be a non-objection to that. That non-objection can come anywhere from later this month into May based upon their timing and how long it takes to get through that. So, we don't anticipate, given the capital plan and what we put in it that anything to read into that other than they're just working through their process, and we'll be back probably later April in May to kind of as soon as we get it, we'll let people know through that. With regard to the magnitude of it, unfortunately, I can't really comment until we get our non-objection from our regulators. David Scharf : Understood. And just as a follow-up question. Wondering if there's any color you can provide on your assessment of competition right now, whether you sense there's been any sort of greater-than-expected pullback in maybe direct mail marketing by some of those who you typically would view as primary competitors, whether just a general purpose or kind of point of sale.  And I guess along those lines, you noted your kind of higher-quality credits were transacting more frequently at larger average purchase sizes. Given all the discussion of macro uncertainty, is there anything that ever tells you that now is the time to consolidate market share in various FICO bands? If you see various pullbacks by competitors? Or is the environment pretty stable relative to the last few quarters? Brian Doubles : Yes. So, look, I would say it's still a pretty competitive environment out there. I think it's a little bifurcated. I think the more established players are still competitive in our space. I'll just put direct-to-consumer side for a second. So, I think we're still seeing it as a pretty competitive environment. The one thing that is encouraging though is I think just given the uncertainty on the horizon, there's pretty good discipline across the more traditional competitors. And I think that's generally the case anytime you enter a period like this, nobody is factoring in credit environment like we've experienced over the last couple of years, I think that's encouraging. So pretty good discipline. I do think you've seen some of the fintech players and some of the newer players pull back a bit. I do think direct-to-consumer direct mail, some of that will pull back a little bit. But generally, in our core space, it's still pretty competitive out there, but with pretty good discipline. David Scharf : Thank you, very much. Operator : This concludes today's Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. Currently, all callers have been placed in a listen-only mode. The call will be opened up for your questions following the conclusion of the management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsive for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn. And good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Synchrony delivered strong financial results, including net earnings of $569 million or $1.32 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.1% and a return on tangible common equity of 21.7%. Synchrony continues to demonstrate strong growth and financial performance as consumer behavior reverts to pre-pandemic norms and as our products and value propositions resonate strongly across our diversified set of platforms and partners. During the second quarter, we opened 5.9 million new accounts and grew average active accounts by 7% on a core basis. Once again, we set a new record as our $47 billion of purchase volume reached our highest level ever for second quarter. These strong sales continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified products and platforms. Health and wellness purchase volume grew 17% compared to last year, reflecting broad based-growth in active accounts, along with higher spend per active account. The 8% growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher average active accounts and reflected continued momentum in several of our new programs. In diversified and value, purchased volume increased 7%, reflecting higher out-of-partner spend, strong retailer performance and the continued impact of newer value propositions driving penetration growth. Lifestyle purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting growth in average transaction values, and outdoor and luxury. And in home and auto, purchase volume was largely unchanged versus year as the benefit of higher average transaction values and growth in commercial products was largely offset by lower retail traffic and a reduction in gas prices. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 41% of total purchase volume in the quarter and increased 14% on a core basis with several of our newer value propositions continuing to drive elevated growth. Our view into the consumer informed by the billions of real time transactional data that we regularly monitor shows continued normalization in consumer behavior toward pre-pandemic levels which has progressed in line with our expectations. Average transaction frequency continued to grow in the quarter, while average transaction values declined modestly. This decline, however, was partly attributable to lower gas prices. A deeper dive into our out-of-partner spend shows continued stability in key discretionary categories such as restaurants and entertainment, as well as in non-discretionary categories like grocery and discount stores. The reduction in average values was noted even among our highest credit quality borrowers which was also accompanied by some modest slowing in transaction frequency. Following the trend from previous quarters, our younger borrowers, as well as those in lower credit grades, continue to reduce the pace of spend. This quarter, given the seasonal impact of tax refunds, we saw a small sequential increase in our payment rates, largely driven by higher credit quality segments. Year-over-year, however, payment rates continued to decline across age and credit bands. Meanwhile, the external deposit data we track shows that the average consumer savings balances declined approximately 2% from the first quarter, but remain approximately 7% above 2020\u2019s average level. So taken together, the payment spend and savings trends we're watching suggest that consumers continue to be well-supported by the constructive labor market and relatively healthy balance sheets as they gradually revert to their pre-pandemic norms. And as we continue to closely monitor the health of our consumers, we are also advancing the key strategic priorities of our business to position Synchrony for long-term success. One of our key priorities is the continued expansion of our multi-product strategy across partners, distribution channels and markets, allowing us to meet our customers\u2019 how and where they want to be met and with a variety of financing solutions that address their specific financing needs in each interaction. We recognize that our customers' needs change over time. And Synchrony can and should be their financing partner of choice throughout life stages. Whether applying in person, online or through an app, we leverage our data and advanced analytics for our digital ecosystem to deliver fast, seamless offers designed to responsibly support each customer's particular purchase. For customers who appreciate the simplicity of an installment loan with flexible terms and payment schedules, Synchrony\u2019s buy now pay later solutions have become popular options and are successfully attracting new accounts and driving deeper engagement. In fact, partners who have launched these products has seen a 29% lift in new accounts with over 95% of the sales coming from new customers. These solutions conveniently integrated into our broader partner relationships and product offerings and matched with our deep insights into the consumer, clearly expand our reach beyond our traditional set of customers and offer our partners another effective tool for engaging with their most loyal shoppers. Most recently, we announced that our partner, At Home, selected Synchrony is its exclusive buy now pay later provider, integrating this installment product with its existing suite of payment options. Customers can select Synchrony Pay Later at checkout, online and in store. And thanks to our integrated data and leading underwriting capabilities, most can be prequalified without impacting their credit score. At Home joins over 700 of our partners, providers and merchants that now utilize Synchrony's installment suite in the form of our pay later, Allegro and secured installment loans. We are excited to further roll out these offerings across more programs and through our proprietary distribution channels over the coming months. As Synchrony continues to broaden our product suite and empower these offerings with our dynamic decision and capabilities, we are better able to acquire and deepen relationships with our customers. We see these new installment products leading to cross-selling opportunities and product upgrades across the business and helping partners build lifelong customers. In campaigns across various portfolios, we have seen that 20% of private label cardholders are eligible for an upgrade to a dual card, which brings higher utility and better value propositions. And our customers respond to these upgrades, with nearly double the purchase volume and 1.6 times the lifetime value to Synchrony. For our partners, these deeper relationships translate into more loyal, better engaged shoppers. And so ultimately, the successful execution of our multi-product strategy means better experiences for everyone, reinforcing a dependable and resilient model for all of our stakeholders. As we head into the second half of 2023, Synchrony is well positioned to capitalize on these and other new opportunities while continuing to consistently deliver for our customers, our partners and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's second quarter results demonstrate the power of our differentiated model, our broad reach across industries and verticals and the compelling value propositions offered on our products were key drivers of our resilient purchase volume. These core Synchrony strengths, combined with our disciplined approach to underwriting, our diverse funding model and our RSA arrangements continue to provide effective offsets to changes in the macroeconomic environment. On a core basis, ending receivables grew 15% versus last year. This was driven by a combination of approximately 130 basis points decrease in payment rate and a 6% growth in core purchase volume. Our second quarter pay rate of 16.8% remains approximately 150 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic historical average. Net interest income increased 8% to $4.1 billion, reflecting 19% growth in interest and fees from higher loan receivables and stronger loan receivable yields, partially offset by the impact of divestitures in the prior year period. On a core basis, interest and fees grew 25%, driven by loan receivables growth, higher benchmark rates and a lower payment rate credit continues to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels. Our net interest margin of 14.94% declined 66 basis points as higher funding costs more than offset the benefit of strong loan yields. More specifically, loan receivable yields grew 145 basis points and contributed 124 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional 53 basis points to net interest margin. Offsetting these improvements was higher interest-bearing liability cost, which increased 263 basis points to 4.04% and reduced net interest margin by 215 basis points. Finally, our mix of interest earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately 28 basis points as continued deposit inflows allowed us to build liquidity and pre-fund anticipated receivables growth in the second half of this year. RSAs of $887 million in the second quarter were 3.85% of average loan receivables. The $240 million decline from the prior year reflected higher net charge-offs and the impact of portfolios sold in the prior year, partially offset by higher net interest income. The RSA continues to provide critical alignment with our partners, and stability in Synchrony's risk adjusted returns as demonstrated through this period of credit normalization and higher funding costs. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.4 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $287 million reserve build which was largely driven by growth in loan receivables. The decline in other income was driven by $120 million gain on portfolio sales recorded in the prior year period. Other expenses increased 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by growth related items as well as operational losses and technology investments. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter improved by approximately 220 basis points compared to last year to 35.5%. In total, Synchrony generated second quarter net earnings of $569 million or $1.32 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.1% and return on tangible common equity of 21.7%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As payment behavior continues to revert towards pre-pandemic historical averages, our delinquency in net charge-off rates continue to normalize towards pre-pandemic performance. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.84% compared to 2.74% last year, which is approximately 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.77% versus 1.22% in the prior year, which is approximately 40 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 4.75% versus 2.73% last year, which is approximately 100 basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6% where Synchrony's risk adjusted returns are more fully optimized. While credit continues to normalize in line with our expectations, we're actively monitoring our portfolio and have undertaken some proactive targeted actions to position our portfolio into 2024. These actions have been focused on certain types of inactive accounts, as well as segments of the portfolio where we are seeing significant score migration into non-prime and are unlikely to have a material impact on purchase volume. Focusing on reserves. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.34%, down 10 basis points from the 10.44% in the first quarter. The reserve build of $287 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth. Our provision did not include any material changes in our qualitative reserves or significant changes in our macroeconomic assumptions. Turning to Slide 10. Funding, capital and liquidity continue to be highlights of Synchrony's performance. During the second quarter, our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with customers. We experienced positive net flows each week, culminating in direct deposit growth of $2.3 billion in the first quarter, which was partially offset by lower broker deposits. Deposits at quarter-end represented 84% of our total funding. The remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at 6% and 10% of our funding respectively. We remain focused on being active issuers in both markets as conditions allow. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $19.4 billion, up $521 million from last year. As a percent of total assets, liquidity represented 17.9%, down 198 basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth. Focusing on our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis points in January and will continue to make annual adjustments of approximately 60 basis points each year until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, 290 basis points lower than last year's levels of 15.2%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 220 basis points to 15.2% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.4% compared to 25% last year. Continuing our commitment to robust capital returns, Synchrony announced approval of an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization for June of 2024, in addition to the $300 million remaining on the prior authorization. We also announced our intention to increase the company's common stock dividend by 9% to $0.25 per share from $0.23 per share beginning in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we returned $399 million to shareholders, reflecting $300 million of share repurchases and $99 in common stock dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had $1 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Synchrony will continue to execute on our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We've also continued to seek opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock. We have a strong history of capital generation and management, which is empowered by our resilient business model. Given the uncertainties in both the macroeconomic environment and the financial services industry, Synchrony remains focused on actively managing the assets we originate and prudently managing the capital we generate to optimize our long-term value creation and resiliency. Finally, please refer to Slide 12 of our presentation for more detail on our full year 2023 outlook. We expect our ending loan receivables to grow by 10% or more for 2023, reflecting the combined impact of the payment rate moderation and purchase volume growth. We continue to expect payment rates to normalize but remain above pre-pandemic levels through the remainder of this year. We now expect our net interest margin within a range of 15% to 15.15% for the full year. Net interest margin in the first half was influenced by higher liquidity due to stronger-than-anticipated deposit flows and receivables gross prefunding. Deposit betas also trended better than expected in the first half, but we have since seen growing competition for deposits. Our revised full year outlook incorporates these first half trends, as well as the anticipated impacts of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the possibility of higher deposit betas in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we expect our net interest margin to fluctuate quarter to quarter, driven by higher liquidity as we pre-planned growth resulting in variation in the mix of interest earning assets and interest and fee growth partially offset by rising reversals as credit continues to normalize. Turning to our credit outlook. We now expect delinquencies to reach pre-pandemic levels during the second half of 2023 versus our previous expectation of an approaching peak in mid-year. Net charge offs should follow a similar but lacked progression through the year. Generally speaking, lost dollars will not reach a fully normalized level until approximately six months following the peak in delinquencies. Given the slightly more moderate pace of delinquency normalization, we now expect net charge offs to trend toward the lower end of our prior outlook between 4.75% and 4.90%. We continue to anticipate losses reaching fully normalized levels on an annual basis in 2024. We expect the RSA to trend below our prior outlook and be between 3.95% and 4.10% of average loan receivables for the full year. This improved range reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, lower net interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth. And given our higher-than-anticipated growth in the first half, we now anticipate quarterly operating expenses to trend at $1.15 billion for 2023. We remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year. Taken together, Synchrony's differentiated model continues to power resilient financial results to a range of environments and we look forward to delivering on our commitments as we close out the second half of 2023. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony's differentiated model has positioned the company well through evolving environments. We consistently power best-in-class experiences for our customers and strong outcomes for our partners even as their needs change. Our business generates strong capital. We are adept at putting that capital to work in an effective prudent manner to deliver sustainable, longer-term growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. As I look ahead to the remainder of this year, I am confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver value to our many stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : With your payment rates still normalizing and purchase volumes relatively stable, what's going to drive the, somewhat a bit of a deceleration in your growth from 15% where it's been recently to kind of closer to 10% plus that you've talked about for year-end? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, good morning, Arren, and thanks for the question. I think it's a little bit less about our current period. You're right. We do anticipate the payment rate continuing to moderate as we move into back end, but be elevated versus the pre-pandemic period. And we do continue to expect to see on a dollar basis, strong purchase volume growth. I think when you look back at the acceleration last year, coming out of Omicron and the pandemic period, there was an acceleration beginning in the second quarter through the end of the year, which provides more difficult comps. I think when you look at it on a V basis and the asset build as payer rate really came off its high last year, it's just a more difficult comp. I think when you think about the volume we're going to put up here in the second quarter all the way through the end of the year, I think it's going to be strong when you look at that performance across all of our sales platforms. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. And then in the digital and health and wellness platforms, both of those are showing continued, really strong growth there. Can you provide a little color about within those segments what's driving the strong growth there? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, sure. Look, I would say we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing across all of our platforms. You look at receivables, up 15% for the company, health and wellness leading the charge at 22%, digital up 18% but even home and auto up 10% is a really good result and really pacing ahead of our expectations so far this year. We've talked about in the past, health and wellness is one of the platforms where we've made incremental investments in marketing and products. And so I think you're seeing those investments pay off. Digital, you've obviously got the benefit of the new programs that sit inside of digital, all of which are performing really well. So we would continue to expect to over-index in those two platforms. Brian Doubles : Okay. Thanks, Arren. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Arren. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior. I know in the past you've talked about customer call-ins and what you're hearing in terms of slower wage or working less hours. Has there been any change there? Brian Doubles : Yeah, I'll start on this one. I think, look, the consumer is still strong. I think there's obviously still spending, excess savings are coming down a bit, but they are still trending above 2020 levels. So when you look at having a pretty strong labor market, the one surprise I'd say so far this year is how resilient the consumer has been. You certainly see that on the growth side. We just reported our second quarter was a record in terms of purchase volume. Credit is very much in line with our expectations, maybe a touch better. We're still operating below 2019 levels. We're below our long-term target of 5.5% to 6%. So everything we're seeing on the consumer is still pretty positive. With that said, we're still operating cautiously. We're monitoring this every hour, every day, we're listening to the calls. I wouldn't say we're hearing anything abnormal. It really is kind of in line with our expectations, and as expected, credit will continue to normalize through the balance of this year and into next. Don Fandetti : Got it. And on the allowance rate, are you still thinking that it's sort of steady to maybe improving a bit? Brian Wenzel : Thanks for that, Don. The first half of the year, I think when we look at the reserve provisioning, there have really been growth from provisions, I think 2.85% and 2.86% respectively for the first quarter and the second quarter. Again, we continue to expect that migration back down towards CECL day one. I think the delinquency formation that we have seen has been in line with our expectations. So again, that will trend out over time. I think the one shift why we haven't changed our macroeconomic assumptions or really things around student loans, they've just been a little bit slower, which is why I think you see us today talking about getting back to that pre-pandemic levels of delinquency in mid second half of this year. So again, it will migrate -- continue to migrate down as long as we believe the macro backdrop comes in line with our expectations. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thank you, Don. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start, I think the first question I have is just on the regulatory front. Specifically thinking around CFPB's late fee rules and also the inquiry into the deferred interest medical costs. Maybe just talk about your perspective on those issues, where things are shaking out and if there's any updates to share and how you're just preparing. [indiscernible] Brian Wenzel : Yes, sure. So let me start on late fees. We've been we've been working on this for over a year now when the initial kind of proposal came out. We're having very productive conversations with our partners around different offsets. I would tell you that they clearly understand that this is an issue that the entire industry has to deal with. It's likely going to result in new pricing models and pricing actions across all issuers. So we've had those discussions with our partners. I'd say no real surprises. They expected to see the things that we're proposing like higher APRs, different types of fees, penalty pricing. And we've also been having a good dialogue around underwriting. And I think they fully appreciate that without some of these pricing offsets that are fairly significant portion of the customers that we underwrite today might lose access to credit. And just to be clear, that's something that we don't want, that's something that they don't want. So our interests are very much aligned on that point. Look, at the end of the day, our goal is to protect the partners. We want to offset the impact here and continue to underwrite the customers that we do today. And then lastly, I'd just say, look, there's a lot still to be decided here. We expect to see a final rule sometime in the fourth quarter. It's likely to be litigated. That's I think the consensus at least what we're hearing. But we've had teams focused on this for a while. We're as prepared as we could be. And so we'll just continue to play through and give you updates as we learn more. And then what was your second question? Mihir Bhatia : It was just on the medical, if there's anything to -- do you have any comments on the inquiry into the deferred interest of the medical comps that they've also been talking about? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, look, I'd say first, we're very proud of the CareCredit products that we offer. In our view, CareCredit is not a medical credit card. The vast majority of what we do there is elective health and wellness spend. So 70% of the business is actually dental and pet care. We worked very hard to ensure that the products are fair and transparent. Deferred interest is a product that's been around for decades. We believe our practices are actually industry leading. So one positive outcome would be just to level the playing field and bring other issuers kind of up to the standards and the things that we do every day. So again, very proud of the product. It's actually one of the products that we get the absolute best feedback on from customers. Mihir Bhatia : And then, just if I could switch here to the credit side, right? Your guidance for delinquency rates, and I think you've talked about consumer being resilient, delinquencies taking a little while to get back to pre-pandemic levels, which obviously is a good thing. But your guidance talks about it approaching pre-pandemic levels here in the next, I guess six months. What happens after that? I mean, your charge-off comments for 2024 suggests you think delinquencies will stabilize at those pre-pandemic levels. So maybe just talk about what gives you confidence that that will happen versus going through those pre-pandemic levels and continuing to grind higher? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So I think the way we think about it and we watch vintage performance, we watch how the world\u2019s kind of come into delinquency. I just want to -- I just want to focus where we are today, right. When you look at average delinquency in the pre-pandemic period and compare it to -- apply that to the balances today, our 30-plus and 90-plus are 87% and 82% of historical levels and that's just been moving up slightly as we step through each of the quarters. I think translating that, that's about 60 basis points lower than 2019 for 30-plus, 40 basis points lower for 90-plus. So I think different than a lot of issuers, we are not at that pre-pandemic delinquency formation yet. Albeit, we are continuing to move closer to that in a very measured approach. And I think when you think about the loss rate, what's flowing to loss now we are at 82% of our, midpoint of our underwriting average. So we look at the formation today and say we feel good about where that is. When we look at the vintages performances, if I go back to \u201818 and \u201819, we're not seeing real significant deterioration in those vintages, they're through their peak loss periods. When we started looking at the pandemic level vintages and particularly in the \u201821 and \u201822 when a lot of issuers, I'd say, adjusted credit standards to kind of put it on, those vintages for us are performing in line with our 2018 and 2019 vintages. So we don't see performance in there or in the back book, if you call it that, that says we're going to be through our underwriting standards in target range for next year. I think we've also been for the first time this year, we did a little bit broader based actions and these were really around, I think de-risking the loss rate for next year and these are really around accounts that are either inactive or see significant score migration into non-prime. So not significant. It's unlikely to have a material impact on sales or credit. But just taking to what I'd say more appropriate prudent actions across the portfolio, in addition to the idiosyncratic options that we're doing. So we feel good with the actions we're taking. We feel good about PRISM and the decision trees that are in inside of PRISM in order to manage credit and adapt quickly to the environment and the vintage performances are in line with our expectations. So that sets us up to how we form. We'll obviously be back towards the end of the year and give updated guidance with regard to the full 2024 loss rate. Hopefully, that gives you some perspective of how we think about them here. Mihir Bhatia : Great. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Brian Doubles : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So Brian, the second half net interest margin guide being in line with the first half, maybe just talk about what is driving your updated expectations. I think you mentioned betas could be higher. I'm assuming now you no longer have rate cuts as per the forward curve. Maybe just talk about what you're assuming for betas and how do you think about the puts and takes for the trajectory of the margin over an intermediate term if rates are going to stay higher for an extended period of time? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, thanks Ryan. So the betas we experienced in the first half of the year, if I make it broadly between savings and CDs, and the savings were mid-70s, were low 90s in CDs. And I think as we step forward into the second half, the one thing was a little bit more price increases from competitors. And I think that comes from a couple of different places. You have certain of the regional banks that are experiencing outflows relative to commercial deposits that's probably twofold, one, them running a little tighter on cash and, two, there's some -- I'd say risk mitigation strategies that some commercial firms are using. So they are becoming a little bit more competitive for deposits. You also see some of the big brick and mortar institutions who are trying to not have to raise their overall deposit rate but using an online product in order to raise rates. That dynamic really merged, I'd say late May into June. So as we think about that mid-70s, low-90s, in our back half assumptions we have it moving up, call, roughly 10 percentage points. So you'd see savings in the mid-80s and you see CDs around 100%. I think as you think forward about deposits, generally speaking, assuming that the market remains, what I'd say rational, we would expect it to be fairly stable. And then hopefully when you start to see rate decreases in the future that the betas will be in a similar type fashion and we can lower it. I think when we think about the back half broadly speaking about an interest margin, we should continue to see some tailwinds relative to the benchmark rates in the first half as they push through the floating portion of our portfolio in the back half. You continue to see revolve rate increases. Most certainly, if you expect the delinquency and losses to kind of come in line, your revolve rate should push up. There will be a little bit of offset there from the reversals as write-offs kind of rise. But again some tailwinds as we come through there. And then clearly some of the liquidity we both up in the first half will get deployed. The second half will also be impacted potentially how liquidity portfolio plays out in some of the wholesale funding that we're going to do in the second half both in the secured and unsecured market. So hopefully that gives you a flavor for how we think about the betas and then in the second half, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then, Brian, we're obviously waiting on a handful of potential regulatory changes in the coming months. Can you maybe just talk about what way, if any, you think this will impact the way that you think about managing both capital and liquidity on a go-forward basis? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah, Ryan. So again, Vice Chair Barr has indicated they will put out proposed rules around capital, which may have a comment period before a final rule is issued in -- then a implementation period a couple of years out to fully transition in. We've obviously been preparing and have run different scenarios relative to the different outcomes when you think about financial changes towards the risk weighted assets or the potential implications from an operating risk perspective. So I think we've been contemplating that relative to our capital plans, we haven't taken definitive actions. I think it's manageable for us. I think if the Fed decides to extend some of the long-term debt or TLAC requirements, from based on the rule that exists today, we feel like we're in a good position. We're in surplus position to know. So I think we feel good about what potentially can come, but obviously we'll look at the rules, we'll evaluate it and most certainly we'll adapt our business and try to be smarter with regard to changes to the risk weighted assets and how we optimize it. But we haven't taken actions to date, but we'll be closely monitoring and we'll certainly be addressing as we move forward. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Ryan. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Thank you. We've seen payment rates remain abnormally high for an extended period of time relative to pre-pandemic levels. And obviously, loan growth is still fairly robust. I mean, do you expect or do you feel that there is a fundamental shift in consumer behavior right now relative to what you were experiencing in 2018, 2019, just given that these payment rates remain very high, and could remain elevated for an extended period of time. Just give us an idea of, if there was a shift in consumer behavior and what you're seeing today? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. So when we look inside payment rate, for a second, there's a couple of different dynamics. Let me start with, we don't see something today that says fundamentally the business, paying rates for us or others will be fundamentally different as we look out you'll call it a year for now or so. When I look underneath and break into segments, what you've seen is a normalization back to pre-pandemic levels for the non-prime and lower credit grades. And what's really kind of boosting the payment rate has been prime customers and super prime customers who have built up excess liquidity during the last couple of years and they continue to pay at a higher rate than they did pre-pandemic. So we expect those people ultimately to normalize back to, I'd say, the pre-pandemic period. We're going to have to wait and see whether that happens. The other dynamic that we have seen is, it has been arising in auto pay, which is a good thing for us. So we've had about 4 percentage point shift up to about 20% of the accounts paying on auto pay. And there, that does help entry rate, does help delinquency. It does change a little bit of the dynamics on the payment rate, but that's not something that we think is going to have a material shift. So again, we think this is continuing to be part of the [case sheet] (ph) recovery and part of the exit out of the pandemic period for now until we get more clarity with regard to when the excess savings or money that's been accumulated during the pandemic totally burns off of those higher credits. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the growth in 10% plus, right, it implies maybe a slowdown from where we are. Do you anticipate an impact on spending and your sales volume due to the student loan restart payments in October? I know you've already made quite a bit of comments on the credit side, but just give us an idea of your expected impact on the spending side. Brian Doubles : Yeah, Kevin. So, again, we understand the population of people who have student loans. We understand the magnitude relative to the amount of the ones that they have outstanding of what is currently in forbearance and non-forbearance. I think when we look at that population and the mix of that population, first of all, they're very close to the FICO range we have, I think they're about 10 points different on event discourse, excuse me, difference. They're within 10 basis points of delinquency. So they look like the regular book, 46% of those people we have underwritten pre-pandemic that we're making payments. So we feel good about their ability to manage the financial situation. So I wouldn't anticipate an impact on that when we think about purchase volume as we move into the back half of the year and into early next year. Again, I want to be clear, I tried to mention earlier in the call, Kevin, I don't think we see purchase on a dollar basis really decelerating, it just goes back into, we have a really tough comp last year for everyone as you saw this acceleration coming out of the backside of the pandemic, which was pent-up spending in demand both for goods and services. So we feel good about the volume. Brian highlighted health and wellness and digital, which are really pulling the engine forward here and we expect that to continue. Kevin Barker : Thank you, Brian. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks guys for taking my questions. Kevin really covered my primary topic, but I'd love to discuss a little bit in terms of funding. You've alluded to the fact that in the second half of the year, you're going to look to the secured and unsecured markets. I'm just curious realizing that you guys have not faced the issues that some financial institutions have had related to deposits, whether the events of this year have caused you to at least take down your sort of target deposit ratio going forward? Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Rick. So, no, we have not altered our intended targets for the funding stack. We feel very confident and very proud of our deposit franchise which I believe provides 84% of our funding. As we look at the first half performance of this year, we are positive on net flows, every week, including the weeks where there was the bank turmoil. So we feel good about our ability to attract deposits and those deposits, when you look at the vintages, we've grown the vintages in the first half of the year back. So customers are sticking with us. We continue to have high retention rate with regard to CD. So the stickiness of having essentially 99% retail deposits are really helping us as we move forward. Our willingness and desire to tap the wholesale markets is a very important part of our funding sources. And I think to some degree, when you go longer periods without being into those two markets, it becomes more costly for people to willing to buy in and underwrite your name. So having a presence in those markets and continuing to be active over time, particularly when we have debt maturities is going to be important. We also have some maturities in the back half of the year relative to CDs and things like that. So to try to manage the betas, accessing the wholesale market in certain increments makes a lot of intuitive sense for us. So again, we feel good about the deposit franchise and that would be again 80-plus-percent of our funding stack as we continue to move forward is our goal. Rick Shane : Great. Hey, Brian, that's very helpful. As you think about the wholesale market, can you talk a little bit in this rate environment and supply and demand, is there -- what is the potential arbitrage in terms of funding versus the deposit market? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Rick, for us, it's really about access. I mean obviously, credit spreads are a little bit wider than we would like given some of the uncertainty and then, well, certainly given some people's -- where benchmark rates may go even after the Fed meeting later this month. So we less look at it as an arbitrage, more as how do I create a steady foundation and have the proper mix going forward. And we think to some degree, we continue to drive what we think is very good performance in the business, show the credit performance here and show our ability to manage the regulatory environment that the credit spreads will tighten in over time. But we don't look at it as arbitrage. We more look at as how do I get a balanced funding need in order to really protect the balance sheet of the company and provide the appropriate liquidity under all situations. Rick Shane : Perfect. That makes sense. Thank you very much. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. There's some news out there that there's at least one large portfolio out there for RFP, big technology company and obviously, Walmart still remains in flux. I'm curious, Brian Doubles, if you could give us a sense of sort of where Synchrony might stand for any larger portfolios or any other deals that might be out there? Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure, Sanjay. Look, I would say, with a couple exceptions, most of what's in our BD pipeline right now are smaller start-up, kind of de novo opportunities, which we're really excited about, but obviously take more time to grow. I think on larger opportunities, obviously, we're very active there as well. But I would also say that's where we\u2019re extremely disciplined as well. In terms of risk return, making sure we got the right balance, the right alignment with partners, I think that's just absolutely critical. So I think you're always going to see us steer a little bit more on the small to midsize deals because we just hold the higher deals to -- or the bigger deals to a higher level of scrutiny in terms of risk and return in alignment with the partner. Sanjay Sakhrani : I appreciate that. And then I could just follow-up on some of the late fee regulation commentary. I guess, one, what I seem to be hearing is like there might not be a whole lot of move on the safe harbor amount that was proposed. And I'm just curious like as we think about how the adjustments might be made, it's a pretty significant decline in that rate. I guess what is your operating assumption as you move forward as you talk partners? I mean, is it as low as the safe harbor that's been proposed? Brian Doubles : Yeah. So look, clearly, think that this proposal has a lot of unintended consequences to consumers, even the small businesses who rely on credit. So we don't agree with $8. We think that $8 is not a deterrent, it's not an incentive to pay on time. It will restrict credit to some customers. It will make credit more expensive to many customers. And so we're very active with the rest of the industry and the comment letter process. And we would certainly welcome a higher amount than the $8. But with that said, we have to prepare for the $8 to go into effect as written right now. And so that's kind of our base operating assumption. We do think that if the cost calculation were designed differently, we could certainly substantiate a cost higher than $8. And so that's another angle that we're pursuing here. But we need to have revenue offsets that we're ready to put in place to offset that because, again, our goal is to protect our partners here and continue to underwrite their customers just like we do today. And so those are the discussions that are ongoing in those. That's really where we've been focused for the last, kind of, 12 months. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for the color. Brian Doubles : Yeah. thanks, Sanjay. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Regarding the credit actions that you've mentioned you're taking into 2024 given some migration on the non-prime side, can you give us more color on what portfolios you're seeing this migration and what actions you're taking, if you can give us a little more detail on that front? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Thanks, John. Obviously, we can't get into specifics with regard to portfolios. But I think broader based, if you had a credit that was in the call it -- [$700 million] (ph) range and you saw a migration of 50 basis points or 60 basis points into non-prime, we would look at that account. Before we used to wait and kind of look at it. Now, we look at it in combination of other factors and decide immediately whether or not we want to reduce the exposure down to the balance. So credit line decrease or two, if it has other attributes that we may be more uncomfortable with, we do credit line closure and account closure on that account. And we do the same thing effectively in our inactive portfolio. So these are, what I'd say, in this way, it's not -- it's unlikely to have a material effect next year is because these are significant movements into non-prime, just because they're not performing the way they would and they had a very significant movement at the time. So again, not broad based. We only draw the fact, to be honest with you, John, because we said all our actions have been idiosyncratic. These are what I'd say minor refinements that -- but again, are more broader based if we see it anywhere in the portfolio, we're going to take action again. It's really more to de-risk next year a little bit, but not something that's likely to have material effect. John Pancari : Got it, Brian. All right. Thank you. And then separately on the expense front, can you give us a little bit more color on your updated expense outlook. I know you bumped that up a bit and mentioned growth in operating losses. So maybe can you help give us more color there and maybe break it out and kind of set out what drove the revision? Brian Doubles : Sure. So when we look at growth, I mean obviously the growth for us, we raised the guide for the beginning part of the year. We are seeing opportunities to invest more in the portfolio. Brian highlighted particularly in the health and wellness and CareCredit, the ability for us to lean into that segment a little bit more, we saw opportunities really to kind of grow with our Allegro product or others that made sense for us to grow the portfolio. So we are seeing growth. We've added some incremental resources around that, which we think drive it -- overall purchase volume has been a little bit stronger in the first half. Again, we expect to have some variable cost increases as you think about more active accounts in the back half of the year as we service those accounts. So from a growth standpoint, those are some of the attributes, and again, ones of which we're going to be, if we find a good risk adjusted return we want to lean into in this environment, from a growth standpoint. The operational losses, we -- the whole industry really benefited the last couple of years has a lot of fraud migrated to some of the buy now pay laters and other people who may not have had as robust fraud strategies in place. So we saw abnormally low and again this is industry wide, fraud relative to purchase volume. That is migrating back to I say is a more historical level. This quarter, we did have one particular incident from a partner who had an exposure which drove the cost up here a little bit, but there was an RSA offset to it. So again, we just see more normal migration back to what would be in the pre-pandemic period. It's not something that we look at and say this is going to become a challenge for the industry or for us individually, just more -- the migration back to more normalized levels. Brian Wenzel : I think adding to that is we're clearly getting operating leverage and you saw a pretty good year-over-year improvement in the efficiency ratio. So that's a key measure for us that obviously, we're very focused on. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Jeff Allison : Hi, good morning. This is Jeff Allison on for Betsy. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the RSA sustainability at these lower run rate levels relative to the longer-term guide you have of the 4% to 4.5%. And what maybe is taking that lower in the 2023 guide with the NCO is going lower as well. Does that reflect something where maybe your retail partners are a little bit more willing to share in the higher OpEx you're seeing come through? Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. The RSA does incorporate expense in. So expenses would flow through to our partners as well as truly impacting now is again some of the pressure you saw in the net interest margin from interest-bearing liabilities cost. They flow through their partner as well. So I think you combine that with credit normalization and you really get the effect that we have. Again, the 4% to 4.25% where we started the year, now at 3.90% to 4.15% is at the lower end of a long-term guide. I think again, long-term guide has a slightly higher net charge off rate by higher margin where you share. But again, we look at the RSA and when you look at the performance when obviously we had much lower net charge offs and the profitability is higher, the RSA was higher. And now as you see a little bit of this interest-bearing liability cost increase, net charge off increase, slightly higher expenses, the RSA is performing like it should and is designed to where it's a little bit lower than expectation. Again, we updated the guidance to be 3.90% to 4.15% and we believe that that is for this year a good estimate of where the performance is going to be and we'll be back. But again, we feel good about a long-term guide and there hasn't been any fundamental shifts in the sharing of economics with our partners. Jeff Allison : And then just in terms of your new account acquisition profile, I know you've talked in prior quarters about the relative tightening you guys have been doing. I was just wondering if we could get an update on any incremental actions you've taken over the last three months? And I know you already gave an update on the student loan repayment side of things. Just wondering if that factors into how you're underwriting people today and maybe what you're hearing from your folks who are calling in on that, that repayment starting? Brian Doubles : Yeah, Jeff, we haven't taken any broad-based actions with regard to account acquisition. We really look there at performance against risk adjusted margin and probability to default on a partner channel basis. So we've been making more assignments there but not broad-based action. So we feel good about it. You got to remember us as an issuer, we get selected for credit versus others who do mailings and choose people to apply for credit. So we have to be hopefully smarter at the time of that decision in which we can gather more data, use data from our partners, usually data attributes bringing it to make that smarter decision. So the other important point I'd say is during the pandemic period, we really don't open and close the acquisition lever. We make small adjustments as we see fit, we're relative to line assignments, but we try to be consistent with our partners and really managing exposures through line. So again, no significant changes on account acquisition. I think you can see that in the consistency of our new account origination both last year and through the first half of this year. Jeff Allison : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Brian Doubles : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. And thanks for\u2026 Brian Doubles : Hey, John. John Hecht : \u2026taking my questions. How are you guys? First one is Brian Doubles. I think you gave a little bit more color on the usage of BNPL and I guess the increased usage of the BNPL product in your portfolio. It sounded like you're emphasizing it in a sense as maybe a customer acquisition tool for some of your counterparties. I'm just wondering with respect to that, is it -- I guess how does it -- is that at the point now where it affects volumes overall and fee structures and that margins overall? And if so, how does the impact of the BNPL product impact those metrics? Brian Doubles : Yeah. Sure, John. So I think just to take a step back, I think just to reiterate what we think is this long-term strategy here is the multi-product and there's real benefits there that our partners are fully realizing now in terms of how these products can complement each other, right? They don't cannibalize, they actually complement each other. And they provide choice to both our partner and their customers. And I think that's really important. So in some partners, this may be customer acquisition tool, right, where we bring them in on a buy now pay later product and then we upgrade them over time and do our revolving product and a dual card. And when we look at the lifetime value of that customer, we can make that work, we can make the economics work. So I think that's kind of the power of this model is that you can make this more attractive to both us and our partners from an economic standpoint. One of the things that we've talked about is we've seen a little bit of a shift in that through the pandemic, you saw partners engaging in buy now pay later, if they need to drive sales, they want to bring in new traffic new customers. And then they took a little bit of a step back in a higher interest rate environment. So a lot of these products are actually really expensive and maybe there's a different model here. And that's really the model that we're employing, which is for some customers and some purchases, an installment loan makes sense. For some purchases, a revolving product makes more sense. And so it really is partner by partner in terms of the strategy that we're employing. But the good news is that we can customize that completely for the partner given the economic sharing and the arrangements that we have with them. So we can really make this work in a number of different ways and customize it in a way that is economically attractive for the partner, but also helps us balance the risk and the return. John Hecht : Okay. That's very helpful color. Thanks. And then, Brian Wenzel, I think you touched on this, I apologize for any redundancy, but maybe quick color on the seasonality of Q3 and Q4 NIM, anything to consider there? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks, John, for the question. I think as you think about net interest margin, again, some of the liquidity deployed as we begin to build assets going into the back half of the year plus some of the tailwinds relative to some of the benchmark rate increases, you should see that net interest margin tick up a little bit in the third quarter and then kind of flatten out in the fourth. So -- but again, I think short-term, I think you see a little bit of benefit from where we exit out of 2Q. John Hecht : That's perfect. Thanks, guys. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question from Dominick Gabriele at Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about the debt collection fees. They seem to be going up a little bit. And I was wondering if there's anything we should read into within that line, not just for Synchrony, but for the general industry when we think about net charge-offs moving forward? And I still have a follow-up. Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah. So when I think about that product, I wouldn't -- well first of all, I'm not sure I can comment for the industry. I think when we look at it, what this represents, we primarily originate this through digital channels. And I see as we push more individuals, how do you see a little bit more sign up as people have the ability to really understand the product, its terms and conditions and sign up for it, number one. And, two, I think as you see average balances increasing, you then get a rate impact on the higher balance that's being protected. So again, a product that we feel good about the benefits that we offer to our consumers. And we do it in a way that's transparent to the digital channels, which obviously we pushed into in the last couple of years a little bit more heavily. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thank you. And if we just talk about expenses a little bit, the incremental expenses between the guidance numbers, could you just talk about where you're kind of putting on the gas pedal? Is it marketing? Is it at customer acquisition or is it tech advancement? How do we think about the incremental spend that drove the increase in, and run rate of expenses? Thank you so much. Brian Doubles : Yeah, thanks for the question. So I think when you think about where we're putting on expenses, first, is going to be in some of the employee costs as we look to people to drive strategic initiatives inside our health and wellness platform and inside really our marketplace and some of the place where we're engaging with the consumer and products. So some of that requires headcount in order to drive some of the technology that\u2019s in there. There clearly is a technology component that leans in there as we have contractors who are building capabilities that really enhance our customers' experience. And then you are seeing a little bit on the marketing wise, we continue to into some of the direct-to-consumer businesses inside of health and wellness as we try to promote the product to really drive the experience and manage what is a very difficult healthcare environment for folks who have more costs or shifting towards them. So it's really across those three levers, employee costs as well as technology and marketing. And you will see that again, that normalization of operational losses as we move forward. Brian Wenzel : And we've got a very disciplined approach on that. We make sure that we're getting the right return on those investments. You're seeing that come through in the top line growth. You're seeing the net effect of that operating leverage and the efficiency ratios I mentioned earlier. Dominick Gabriele : Perfect. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Operator : This concludes Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you so much.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Synchrony Financial Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to the Company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. Currently, all callers have been placed in a listen-only mode. The call will be opened for your questions following the conclusion of the management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the Company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today's Synchrony reported strong third quarter results, including net earnings of $628 million or $1.48 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.9%. These results highlight the strength of Synchrony's differentiated model and the resiliency of our business through economic cycles. Our diversified product suite and advanced digital capabilities enabled Synchrony to continue to deliver consistently strong results in an ever-changing environment. We are increasingly at the center of customers' everyday financing needs, and position as the partner of choice for retailers, merchants and providers alike as they seek enhanced value, greater utility and best-in-class experiences. We opened 5.7 million new accounts in the third quarter and grew average active accounts by 6%. We continue to drive growth with our $47 billion of purchase volume, representing a record third quarter and a 5% increase versus the prior year. This momentum is a testament to the power of our diversified portfolio. Health & Wellness purchase volume grew 14% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts led by Dental, Pet and Cosmetics. The 7% growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher average active accounts as several of our newer programs continue to resonate with consumers and diversifying value, purchase volume grew 7%, reflecting growth in out-of-partner spend and strong retailer performance. Lifestyle purchase volume increased 8%, reflecting growth in average transaction values and outdoor and luxury. And in Home & Auto, purchase volume remained flat versus last year as growth in commercial products, home specialty and the auto network was generally offset by lower retail traffic in furniture and electronics and the impact of lower gas and lumber prices. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume in the quarter and increased 13% as several of our newer value propositions continue to drive greater customer engagement. Synchrony's range of products and platforms gives us a unique view into the health of the consumer. Through our monitoring, we see continued trends of behavior normalizing to pre-pandemic levels. Across the portfolio, average transaction values leveled off through the quarter after modestly declining in the second quarter. Meanwhile, average transaction frequency, which had climbed throughout the year, showed some signs of stabilization towards the end of the quarter. Looking at our auto partners spend, our customers are becoming more selective in making larger purchases, including home furnishings and electronics and spending less on travel. Directionally, we see broad trends that are in line with our expectations across the portfolio with slowing spend growth, normalization payment rates and growth in balances, which is driving higher net interest income. While in the external deposit data we track, consumer savings balances remain approximately 8% above the average level in 2020. In summary, these trends show a consumer that continues to benefit from a strong labor market while reverting gradually towards historical spend and payment norms. As we closely monitor the health of the consumer, we also continue to develop and deploy the compelling products and value propositions that attract consumers and partners to Synchrony. We announced earlier this month that both the PayPal and Venmo cards can now be provisioned in the Apple Wallet, representing our latest enhancement as we evolve to meet the demands of our increasing digital first customers. Synchrony's journey began with in-store financing options, which have long been valued tools for both retailers and consumers to build loyalty and drive value. Over time, we've broaden the utility of these products through our dual and co-brand card strategies, which enable customers to make out-of-partner purchases, accumulate rewards and extract even greater value. Increasingly, our customers are taking that engagement even further as digital wallets enable everyday use functionality and extend our leading value propositions well beyond the store. Active wallet users are up over 45% year-to-date and sales on wallets are over 70%. This trend is more than a simple technological enhancement. Synchrony's strategy to deliver enhanced utility and best-in-class experiences requires seamlessly integrated, tailored solutions and our investments in technology allow us to meet this demand. When our customers combine the broad utility of our products and services with our digital wallet functionality, the impact is clear. Our digital wallet users spend nearly twice as much and have over double the transactions on average. More broadly, we see the impact of expanded product utility in our results. Auto partner spend continued its outsized growth this quarter, up 12% compared to last year. We continue to develop our solution suite and extend the reach of our products meeting consumer demand for fast and secure shopping and opening new opportunities for customers to engage with their favorite brands. In Health & Wellness, we were pleased to announce partnerships with veterinary hospitals at three additional universities. CareCredit is now accepted at 95% of the nation's public veterinary university hospitals in addition to more than 25,000 provider locations, expanding access to flexible financing tools that enable a lifetime of care for all pets. The power of Synchrony's continually evolving model, supported by our focus on technological innovation, continues to position Synchrony as the partner of choice as we deliver digitally powered experiences and compelling value for our many stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian. Good morning everyone. Synchrony's third quarter results reflected the strength of our financial model demonstrates to our consistent growth and strong risk deducted returns. The compelling value propositions of our broad product suite continue to resonate with our 70-plus million customers and drove broad-based growth across our sales platforms, ending loan receivables grew 14% versus last year, benefiting from the combination of approximately 120 basis point decrease in payment rate versus last year and 5% growth in purchase volume. Our third quarter was 16.3%, still remains approximately 130 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic historical average. Manage interest income increased 11% to 4.4 billion, reflecting 21% growth in interest in fees. The increase in interest in fees was due to the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates as well as lower payment rate. Our net interest margin was 15.36% declined 16 basis points compared to the prior year as higher funding costs more than offset the benefit of higher yields and favorable asset mix. Specifically, loan receivables yield grew 114 basis points and contributed 95 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional 46 basis points to net interest margin, and our mix of interest earning assets improved net interest margin by approximately 28 basis points, reflecting our strong growth in loan receivables. But these gains were more than offset by higher interest bearing liability costs, which increased 229 basis points to 4.34% and reduced interest margin by 185 basis points. RSAs of $979 million in the third quarter or 4.04% of average loan receivables, a $7 million decline from the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. Our RSAs continue to perform as designed. They provide a critical alignment with our partners as we navigate the evolving environment together and support greater stability in our returns. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.5 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $372 million reserve build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables. Other expenses grew 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by the growth-related items as well as technology investments and operational losses. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter improved by approximately 330 basis points compared to last year to 33.2%. Summarizing our financial results, Synchrony generated net earnings of $628 million or $1.48 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3% and return on tangible common equity of 22.9%. Next, I'll cover our credit trends on Slide 8. Our delinquency performance in the third quarter continued to reflect normalization towards pre-pandemic behavior with both the 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates approaching 2019 levels. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.40% compared to 3.28% last year and approximately 7 basis points lower than third quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.06% and versus 1.43% in the prior year and approximately 1 basis point lower than our third quarter 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 4.60% versus 3% last year. Synchrony remains approximately 115 basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, where our risk-adjusted returns are more fully optimized. Overall, our credit performance remains within our expectations and has benefited from investments in our advanced underwriting platform as we expect to continue on a path towards our long-term operating targets. Focusing on our more recent vintages, they continue to perform in line with those from 2019. While we're pleased with how these vintages are developing, we're continuously monitoring our portfolio and have implemented further credit actions include some tightening of our origination criteria. These proactive refinements are intended to position our business for 2024 and beyond. Moving to reserves, our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.40% up 6 basis points from 10.34% in the second quarter. The reserve build of $372 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth. Turning to Slide 10. Our stable funding model and strong management of capital and liquidity continue to position Synchrony well for any environment. In the third quarter, customers continue to be attractive to our consumer bank offerings as we grew both direct and broker deposits to fund our anticipated receivables growth, deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end. The remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at 7% and 9% of our funding, respectively. We completed a $1 billion securitized issuance in the quarter, and we'll continue to be active in both markets as conditions allow. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $20.5 billion, up $275 million from last year. At quarter end, liquidity represented 18.2% of total assets down 192 basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth. Moving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony made its annual transition adjustment of approximately 60 basis points in January, and we'll continue to make annual adjustments of approximately 60 basis points each year until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we entered the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, 190 basis points lower than the last year's level of 14.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.2% under the CECL transition rules compared to 15.2% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 120 basis points to 15.3%, and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased in basis decreased to 22.5% compared to 24.1% last year. During the third quarter, we returned $254 million to our shareholders, consisting of $150 million of share repurchases and $104 million of common stock dividends. And at the end of the quarter, we had $850 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Synchrony well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow. Now, please refer to Slide 11 of the presentation for more detail on our outlook for 2023. We expect our ending loan receivables to grow approximately 11% versus last year, reflecting the combined impact of payment rate moderation and slowing purchase volume growth. We expect a full year net interest margin of approximately 15.15%. Net interest margin in the third quarter benefited from strong growth in interest and fees and receivables in addition to payment rate moderation and lower deposit betas. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest margin to be impacted by higher average liquidity to prefund seasonal loan receivables growth impacting the mix of interest-earning assets, higher deposit betas driven by competition and movement in benchmark rates and interest and fee growth, partially offset by rising reversals. From a credit standpoint, delinquencies nearly reached 2019 levels at quarter end, and should file seasonal trends from this point. With the increased visibility into delinquency performance this year, we are tightening our forecasted with net charge-off rate to approximately 4.85%, we continue to anticipate our loss rate reaching a fully normalized level between 5.5% and 6% on an annual basis in 2024. And as we noted, we will continue to monitor and position the portfolio for 2024 and beyond. We expect the RSA to trend at the low end of our prior outlook and to be approximately 3.95% of average loan receivables for the full year. This improved outlook reflects the impacts of the continued credit normalization, lower net interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth. And as we generate higher-than-anticipated growth, we are maintaining our expectation for operating expenses at approximately $1.15 billion per quarter while we continue to make selective investments in our business. We're committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year. As Synchrony continues to leverage our core strengths, our advanced data analytics, our discipline approach to underwriting and credit management, and our stable funding model, we're confident in our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver market leading returns over long term. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony continues to demonstrate both the agility and consistency of our differentiated model. We remain focused on optimizing the outcomes for our many stakeholders by closely managing the drivers of our business, which we control, and intently monitoring and preparing for those which we do not. We are prioritizing sustainable growth to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted margins through changing market conditions. We are prudently investing in the future and long-term growth of the business, so we are able to exceed the increasingly digital demands of our consumers, and we are delivering on our financial commitments even as we ready the business for an evolving environment to ensure our continued ability to drive long-term value into the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Maybe a two-part question on credit. First, can you -- if the full year guide implies a decent acceleration in charge-off performance in the fourth quarter. So, you can maybe just talk a little bit about what's driving that? And then second, maybe just tease out what gives you confidence that we're going to follow, seasonal patterns from here given a handful of moving pieces, inflation, resumption of student loan payments. And then obviously, we have the growth math impacts from '22 and '23 but offsetting that, you guys obviously were one of the more conservative in underwriting given some of the tightening that you have done. So can you maybe just walk through all of those moving pieces and what you think it means for the trajectory of credit losses? Brian Wenzel : Sure. I'll try to get to all those embedded questions, Ryan. So the first one, as you think about the fourth quarter, I mean you look at the dollar value, a little over $2 billion sitting in the 90-plus delinquency bucket, so I think if you go back and look at how it rolls, you get a pretty good sense of what we see from the fourth quarter. I'd say the delinquency performance has made consistent really throughout 2023. And really what you have here is a factor of our entry rate into delinquency is still below the pandemic period. So it's back -- it's lower than 2018, 2019, which makes collections a little bit tougher on the stuff that does roll in. So that's how I think about the fourth quarter. When you start to think about 2024 and really how we get comfortable around, credit performs, a handful of things to hit back and say, number one, we didn't accordion the credit box, right? So we open and close in on our partners. So our underwriting was consistent. And to some degree, in the early part of the pandemic, we did not shrink as much. We'd not expand as much when everyone was trying to make up for the lost vintages. So, we kind of kept consistent throughout that period, number one. Number two, our PRISM advanced underwriting tools allows us to score line and use that data from our partners, we think, hopefully, we made very good choices or good choices during the pandemic period. When I then look at some of the data, Ryan, I still look at the vintages that we put on in the pandemic period, they're generally performing in line with the '18, '19 vintages. So, we're not seeing deterioration. Even when we look externally, the TransUnion data, we see we're performing better than the vintages of other folks. So again, I think we feel comfortable with the tools we have in place and we're comfortable with the performance. That said, Ryan, we did take some actions here in the quarter, and that was mainly around the fact that we do have a shared consumer. So other people who have maybe made certain underwriting choices can flow through to us. And so, we want to make sure that our loss rate stays in our targeted range, and we really took actions in order to ensure or try to ensure that we stay within our targeted underwriting washer of 5.5 to 6 and optimize our risk-adjusted margin. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe as a follow up, Ryan, so you know, the RSA seems to be coming in better than had initially been forecasted given the guidance for $395 million for the year. And we look forward, losses are on a continued normalization and loan growth seems to be slowing. So, can you maybe just tease out some of the moving pieces as we head into '24? It feels like we're kind of back in an environment similar to where we were in the 2018, 2019 timeframe when credit was normalizing and the RSA was coming in well below that 4% threshold. So, can you maybe talk through some of those pieces? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes, thanks again, Ryan. As I think about the RSA, it's really performing as we designed it to be, right? So when losses were extremely low, it went over 6% level and now we're back into an environment today it's sub four, and again it driven by a couple of factors. One, the charge off rate, charge off dollars are clearly an impact, most certainly the impact of cost of funds and interest-bearing liabilities just flowing through. I think as you think forward the things that are going to make it move a little bit, it's going to be the mix of the portfolio. Obviously, you look at something like health and wellness we don't have as much of RSA its growing a little bit faster. And then again, you're going to have in some of the other portfolios that have a maybe higher percentage of RSAs depending upon their growth rates will influence it. But again, it should track consistently. I always point to Ryan we've talked about this before, if you looked at RSAs as a percent of purchase volume, it is pretty stable through seasonal trends. So, again, we expect it to continue to operate the way it historically has. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : My first question is on direction of the net interest margin. So it seems like we've fully solidified the notion of hire for longer in \u201924. How should we think about how your net interest margin should perform in a higher for longer environment? And as we think about funding costs on the other side of the cycle, when we eventually get to rate cuts, although the forward curve keeps pushing that out, how sensitive should we think about your funding costs relative to cuts and fed funds? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Erika. So I think as we think about the margin as we move forward here, there's a little bit of tailwind still to go on prime rate. That flows through the book here in the fourth quarter. I think the second thing you're going to continue to see a benefit on the margin coming from higher revolve. We're still paying rates that are 130 basis points above the pandemic period. So again, there should be some push up there. There should be a little bit of a headwind relative to reversals that go against that. So that's really, as I think about the yield side of the equation. On the interest-bearing liabilities side of the equation, Again, there are a lot of assets that were put on -- excuse me, a lot of deposits that were put on this year, they're going to have to reset next year. So a little bit of tick up next year in the interest-bearing liabilities as those shorter days CDs hopefully renew. I think when you get to the backside of the cycle, that's really to be seen, right? There's a case that can be made where betas will be a little bit slower coming down for some of the folks that want to try to gather deposits and get the yield side of their investment portfolio is up. There are some that are going to want to try to push down the cost of fund base or NIM sensitive. So, I think as we get closer to that, we can probably give you a better perspective of which way that will turn. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is on capital. There's been a lot of discussion for card companies in particular with regards to how we should treat unfunded commitments and also the timing differences in terms of higher ACL ratios in terms of the numerator deductions. So could you give us a little bit of a preview, so to speak, on how the pending new capital rules could impact Synchrony? And how you're expecting that to impact your approach to capital management? Brian Wenzel : Yes, great question, Erika. So when we look at the rules, the first thing I'd say, probably along with others, we're clearly disappointed with the proposed rules around capital, both from the process in which the fed went through as well as certain elements that we don't think we're clearly thought through fully if you thought about a holistic review of the capital stack, right? You combine that with what I would say some apparent gold plating. It's very difficult, I think, for the industry as a whole. And I think you're seeing that in bank's feedback, I think you're seeing it through the trade group feedback. And I think there's some even level of concern with the fed governors with regard to that. And then finally, when you think about Synchrony before I get to the details, we're clearly disappointed that the tailoring rules effectively have been eliminated by treating us on the same level as a lot of the other banking institutions. With that said, Erika, if we looked at just taking those rules as they are, again, we're not sure that they will stay as they are. The impact to us is probably between the 15% to 20% higher impact to capital. And the range there depends really upon how you treat some of the RSA when you found the operational risk pieces with the RSA offset, the fraud and some of the revenue items. When I think about the unfunded commitments that is a fairly significant add back to the RWA. The good news for us, I think we have a path where through mitigation strategy, we think this would be very manageable. It's an active the way it was today. And part of it, we think about the unfunded commitments, a good bulk of that is with accounts that are deemed and active. So, we can adjust line strategies without impacting current customers in our business. So, I'm not sure as we look at it and we talk about as a company, we believe there is a significant aspect with how we manage the growth side of the business. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess my first question, Brian Wenzel for you in terms of the reserve rate going forward. We've seen some of the card issuers make adjustments to kind of what's inside the reserve and what's not. And there's some risks associated with inflation and the fact that behaviorally things are trending a little bit different than they have in the past. Maybe you could just talk about the migration of reserve rate going forward and you feel comfortable in the methodology at this point? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. Obviously, we feel comfortable at the end of the third quarter that we have the right level of losses. As you think about it, the base assumptions that we have in the reserve model really didn't change. I think when you look at the baselines that are out there, there's not a significant shift in the underlying assumptions that are going into the model. As we looked at the quarter, what you did see is a little bit of shift between the quantitative portion of the model and the qualitative portion. But again, through the past history, we've -- we think through the scenarios that we run that we've accounted for a potentially worsening macro. We hopefully have captured inflation in as part of that model and then we also have student loans as part of it. So we feel good about where we are as we sit today, and that we can withstand changes in the macro environment. That said when we look at it, there are 6 basis points of coverage between second quarter and third quarter given these models that isn't significant I wouldn't read into it that we have a deteriorating picture as we closed the quarter. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. And then maybe one for Brian Doubles. Brian, can you just talk about sort of the backdrop for portfolio acquisitions, any renewals that kind of stuff? And then maybe just the competitive environment in general? Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Sanjay. So look, I would say, generally, it's a pretty constructive competitive environment. I think, what we're seeing in the market around pricing new opportunities, renewals is pretty disciplined. And I think any time you enter into a period like we're in right now where there's some uncertainty on the horizon, you tend to see issuers stay a little bit more conservative and a little more disciplined, which is good news for us. In terms of renewals, we just announced Belk this quarter. It's a great renewal for us kind of a normal quarter. Great partner, very engaged customer base, and so obviously, we're always out there working the renewal pipeline on our portfolio. And then in terms of new opportunities, I would say, on balance, it's probably more new program opportunities, startup opportunities, less of the kind of big programs that are out there coming to market. And I think that'll hold true probably for the next 12, 18 months. And then beyond that, I think you'll probably see some bigger programs come up and be in the market. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : First up, you guys have had pretty steady flow of new accounts for us three quarters. I'm wondering, I mean given where you're underwriting and kind of what's going on in the world, kind of maybe what are the characteristics of the new customers and any change from where you were a few years ago? And then what are the sources of the new customers as well? Brian Doubles : Yes. John, I would say consistent kind of trends on new accounts, both in terms of absolute magnitude as well as where the accounts are coming from. One of the things that Brian mentioned as we think about underwriting, we don't expand the credit box in really good times, and we try not to really restrict it in more uncertain times. And that means that we have more of a steady trend in terms of both, new accounts, active accounts, et cetera. I would tell you that the new programs that we recently launched or performed really well. We're seeing really good growth there. So, we continue to be encouraged on that front. And you're seeing, I would say, really good trends across all of the platforms. As we look at growth, it's not one platform that's really outperforming. You're seeing that a little bit with Health & Wellness, but it's pretty broad-based and that's encouraging. I think the consumer has been much more resilient than any of us anticipated a year ago, and you're seeing that across the board, whether you look at purchase volume, receivables, new accounts, active accounts. If we had to pick a metric, that's one that's probably a little bit more important than new accounts because keeping that consumer engaged offering them more than one product, like that's a big part of our strategy. And so, we've been pleased so far all year. John Hecht : Okay. That's very helpful. And then second question is, I think I said that you guys do some disclosure that you guys were involved in at least evaluating GreenSky. Yes. I'm wondering kind of what's the appetite for acquisition? I would assume the environment's a little bit better now with different opportunities. So, maybe if you could just take us through what you're looking at and where you might go from that perspective. Brian Doubles : Yes, I mean, look, we're always opportunistic when it comes to potential M&A opportunities. You know, at the same time, John, you know, we're extremely disciplined around the financial return of those opportunities making sure that they're accretive. We weigh that against buying back our stock and other opportunities. So look, we're always in the market. We've done some really nice smaller acquisitions over the last couple years. Pets Best has been an absolute home run for us. Since we acquired that business I think the pets and for us is up 5x just between 2019 when we acquired it and now. Allegro has been a great acquisition for us. Again nice acquisition, relatively small in terms of the capital outlay for that, but we've been able to leverage the scale at health and wellness to grow that. We picked up some new products as part of that. So those are the types of acquisitions that we really like to do. But with that said we look at larger opportunities, but they've got to make sense. We balance those against other uses for our capital and they've got to have, a nice return profile for us and a good path to EPS accretion. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : Have you seen any particular shifts in payment rate trends for the near prime to prime consumer? Appears some of your competitors mention that there's a little bit more weakness, primarily due to household net worth or even savings rates within that cohort, are you seeing any changes in payment rates there? Brian Wenzel : Yes, good morning, Kevin. The first thing when we think about the consumer, there's a lot of focus that goes into savings rates. And I'd say that's the higher end consumer cohorts do have access savings that's in there. But the prime we kind of right on the prime level to subprime, they've benefited by a 22.6% wage increase since 2019, which has been able to really bolstered in through this period. When I look at payment rates and compare them year over year, right, where you see probably the biggest shift in the payment rate is in that 6.60 to 7.20 bucket. They're all moving from a little bit more full pay, a statement pay down, but the biggest shift is in that 6.60 to 7.22, which isn't necessarily that concerning to us and still below, above where they were in the pre-pandemic period. So I'd say a shift, it's not something that we are concerned about or find it to be concerning at this point. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then, I know it's very early, but are you seeing any impact on payment rate trends for folks with federal student loans? I know it's, first few weeks\u2026 Brian Wenzel : It's early, yes. So what's actually interesting, Kevin, when you look at that cohort, a couple things we've done a lot of analysis on this group of people. We continue to do it. I think when you look at the month of September we saw a significant rise in people making payments in advance of their student loan payments beginning in October. So, that's a very good sign for us with regard to that. We did a deeper dive and we looked at how they are performing those accounts against instead of the entire book, really against, I'd say credit cohorts. And to be honest with you, Kevin, you're going to find this interesting. They actually are performing better with people with student loans versus people without student loans. So, they clear to be very, very cautious. Again, the fact that people significant number of people did pick up payments prior to their due date. So again, what we expect going forward is that the fourth quarter's going to be a little bit noisy. So with regard to people who may have forgotten, got new servicers, et cetera, and then you'll start to get a much better read as you move into the first quarter. What's going to be challenging for issuers is the fact that they're not -- we don't expect them to be reported to the bureaus until January 25. So there are things that we're going to watch with regard to changing in those balances and see whether or not we can detect through the work of the bureaus, whether not they are resuming payments and how much they're paying down. So we've kind of set that up in advance to monitor the population. Again, we think we provided for them in prior periods for when they may struggle. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our question from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Adelson : Just wanted to get an updated view on the late fees from the CFPB here, I know we're almost done with October and I haven't heard anything yet. Just wondering, has there been any shift in the dialogue out there? Or are you still fully expecting the rules to come out as proposed? And I guess as a part of that question, when the rule comes out, are you going to be taking any sort of proactive, preemptive actions in preparation? Or are you more just going to be in the wait-and-see approach and wait to see how it plays out in the courts? Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So look, we're obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued. So, there's plenty of unknowns out there until we see the final rule. We got to see things like the implementation period, the final amount. We also believe that will be litigated. So, we're going to watch that carefully, and that could impact the timing as well. So I guess what I would say is, look, we're prepared for multiple scenarios in terms of timing. We've been -- we've been working very closely with our partners for over six months now. We're working on pricing offsets really with the goal of offsetting the impact here and putting us in a position with our partners where we can underwrite a large cross-section of the customers that we do today. We're obviously goes without saying we're disappointed in the rule. Obviously, we think it has unintended consequences that weren't properly evaluated. Late fees are a very important incentive to pay $8 just clearly is not an incentive. So without those offsets, it would restrict access to a pretty significant cross-section of consumers. And no change to what we've said in the past. Our goal is to protect our partners, fully offset the impact and continue to underwrite and approve the majority of the customers that we do today. Jeff Adelson : Got it. Thanks. And just on the credit tightening side, I know you've discussed some more actions there, positioning yourself for 2024, but at the same time, you weren't leading it as hard as your peers, you were sort of ahead of the curve there. Just wondering what would cause you to lean back in at this point? Is there any sort of signals you're looking for out there or any sort of timing around that to be expecting? Brian Wenzel : Just to be clear to lean back into loosening credit or\u2026. Jeff Allison : When you might, widen the credit box again. Brian Doubles : Yes. Listen, we have a very good credit team that's consistently evaluating performance of the portfolio by partner, by vertical, by channel. And I think to some degree we want to see how cred develops across the industry. Again, I talked about a shared consumer, so what other issuers are doing or not doing can have a flow through effect to us. So, again, we will watch those things. There's not a telltale sign to say, once this happens, we will go. But our team, you has a lot of tools. We use a lot of data. We're using much more decision tree and non-core based measures in order to assess that. And again, the data elements that we get from partners will tell us how the consumer's performing. So we'll continue to look at that. And again, Brian said it, I said, we don't move the credit box around that often because our partners want consistency and origination. Our customers want to have consistent underwriting from us and that's part of our lower line low and growth strategy. Operator : Thank you. We'll move next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Regarding the back to the late fees, can you maybe just give us a little bit of color how do you think about the timing of the offsets that you're negotiating at this time with your partners? You mentioned pricing and I'm assuming there's other factors, maybe if you could just talk about the once the rule goes in place, what type of timing should we expect in terms of being able to see some of the offsets of that initial impact? Brian Wenzel : So look, I mean obviously, there's still things related to timing that we don't know yet. And primarily that's when the rule goes into effect the impact of any litigation as well as the implementation period. And the final rule the original rule as written was 60 days. That's just clearly not enough time to get this done. So, we think that hopefully, it'll be longer than that. And those are the discussions that we're having with each of our partners and that will influence the nature of the pricing actions and the timing in which they, in which they go in. So I can't be really more specific than that, but we've got a really good plan in place, partner by partner. We've been working on this for over six months. We feel good about the conversations that we've had and the actions that we're going to take, if the final rule goes into effect as written. John Pancari : And then my second question is kind of a two-parter. First on the incremental credit actions that you implemented in the third quarter, maybe just elaborate there around what exactly you did in the third quarter versus what you've been doing previously. And then separately, you mentioned that the RSAs are not as heavy in the health and wellness sector or business line. Can you talk about how much lower and then other product areas that may also have a lower RSA? Brian Wenzel : So with regard to the credit actions we took a lot of it is around originations, but not around necessarily score cutoffs as much as it is different data elements or different criteria that we factor differently in account originations. We also are working on account management type actions. So triggers that comes from the bureaus of certain attributes or criteria where we would turn in a form or watch to a credit line decrease or a closed account. So those are the five, two flavors of it. Again, it's not necessarily shifting cutoff, it's really focusing on different criteria that are coming into our underwriting account management engine. With regard to the second part of your question on the RSAs, we just highlight, you know, health and wellness. And I think we said it before, you know, there's not a lot of RSA sitting in that particular sales platform. So we just, if that platform grows at a faster rate, has a little bit of an influence on the overall RSA for the Company. Outside of that, we're not going to go into the different sales platforms from there the rest do have some level in each of the sales platforms. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to start with, just going back to the discussion around credit. You know, your credit guidance for the full year implies I think a 4Q pretty close to the 5.5%, you know, getting back to your long-term target. I was curious on how you see that evolving. I know you've talked about keeping underwriting pretty steady, but you've also tied in, we've seen some pretty fast normalization here in the back half of this year. Do you think it gets above your 5.5 to 6% target for a little bit in 2024 before coming back down kind of a give back from the strong years you had over the last couple of years? Brian Wenzel : Yes, well, good morning, Mihir. The first thing I'd say, and I don't think we've got enough credit for it as a company. But we still haven't reached, and again, I know it's seven basis points and one, we still not have reached our pre-pandemic delinquency metrics. I think there's only a couple of issuers that are in that category. So I wouldn't, I think we shouldn't undersell that, number one. I think number two, when you look at the performance I'm not sure I would characterize as accelerating in the fourth quarter. If you go back and look at the growth on a dollar basis, in \u201817 and \u201818 on average, versus this, they grew on average 18 to 19% in the \u201817 to \u201818 period. And we grew, you know, in this quarter 18 to 20% on a 30 plus and 90 plus basis. So, probably in line, I'd say with seasonality, when you look at the relative percentages, if you think about bps, they were 40 and 20 or 50 and 20 we're 56 and a little bit over 20. So there is not, there's not a big deterioration, I'd sit there and say, characterize it that way. You know what, as I, as we look at the performance for net charge off next year as a full year basis, one of the reasons why I think we've tightened a little bit here, again, given the share of consumers, we're trying to maintain losses inside that five and a half to six and setting up the portfolio well to perform there. Cause that's where we think the optimized risk adjusted margin is for us as a company. I know others, you know, clearly are thinking now that they're going to, they're willing to take a higher net charge off rate and a lower margin. That's not where we want to operate this company and deploy capital it's not as effective for us. So we're going to be disciplined around that. So again, when I look at that, and if you go back to earlier in the call, I talked about some of the vintage performance and other things that we've seen, it gives us, you know, some level of comfort that, that we have a pretty good view of the trajectory. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. And then maybe just switching gears completely a little bit. I wanted to ask about the BNPL offering at Lowe's, obviously not as topical today as maybe 12 or 24 months ago. But I think you've rolled it out this quarter or very recently. It looks like you are the exclusive provider for the BNPL offering there and it's a white label, basically of the Synchrony Pay, which they're calling lower space. So I was wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit. Just talk about what do the economics look like? Is it tied to your card offering in some way? Is this a competitive process? Is this an area you're looking to expand and build out with other retailers? How are you thinking about that product? Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. So maybe to start more broadly. I think this has been an area where we been investing with our partners. I think the pay later products that we offer. It's a great way really just to engage more customers and offer them a new financing offer that's got really nice utility. We are seeing proof that the product does provide both value to us and to our partners. If you look at the results this quarter, year-over-year, we've grown installment and pay later products 29%. So we're clearly over-indexing in that product. So we can feel pretty good. I think the multiproduct strategy that we've been talking about for well over a year now is starting to pay off, and you're seeing that with what we announced and launched with Lowe's. The lowest pay is a white label version of that. And so one of the things that's really important to our strategy is flexibility both in terms of how we offer the product inside of our partners but flexibility to the consumer as well. So we're willing to offer that as Synchrony pay later, and we do that for a number of partners. We're also willing to white label it, which I think is a real competitive advantage for us because a lot of partners or a lot of competitors are not willing to do that. We're seeing really good traction on the launch so far, and we're just really pleased to be able to offer another product inside of our Lowe's partnership Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Talk a little bit more about the health of the consumer in terms of the lower end versus the higher end, and also do you feel more comfortable on one or the other based on what you're seeing going forward? Brian Wenzel : Yes, so I think when you look at the consumer across three different metrics, the spending metrics, the payment metrics and then obviously the credit metrics. Let me start with credit first. That consumer is the one, who is struggling. We see a little bit more of those back to pre-pandemic levels in delinquency and their performance in delinquency and then deeper non-prime performing a little bit worse. So from a credit standpoint, they get in delinquency, they don't really have the ability to cure out of it, and are using other forms like settlements and debts that certain -- debt settlement companies in order to kind of solve some of it, and that to be expected in this environment that they just don't have as much access to liquidity. Again, what's keeping that consumer base going is a broad-based wage increase that has helped fuel that. So even though they may have spent the dollars that they got during the pandemic, stimulus packages, they do see larger wage gains. So again, what we're continuing to see is why the transaction values area little bit lower for them, the frequencies up and they're continuing to spend it. We think a very a very manageable pace. Again, when we look at our book and I look at the average balance in our book for -- if you look at \u201819 versus now, it's up a CAGR 5%, and the open buys up a little bit more. So I think the consumer is being relatively disciplined and there is more liquidity in the system for them. Clearly, when we look at a high-end consumer, the high-end consumer is performing incredibly well. Their payment rates remain above 2019 levels. They are showing strength. We've skewed in high end of prime up probably 3 percentage points in the super high end, which also has helped the portfolio performance. So again, we feel good and again, when I look at the entire portfolio entry into delinquency is still below 2019 levels. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Most have been asked and answered, but I just want to talk a little bit more about the RSA guide, and the improvement there. When we look at the charge off rate, when we look at NIM, when we look at everything, it looks like everything is kind of within the range, but o of expectations, both from an original perspective at the beginning of the year and from a second quarter perspective. But for whatever reason, you feel like the RSA charge is going to be down a little bit is that really just a function of mix or what else is contributing to that? Brian Wenzel : It really is mixed between the platforms and between the portfolios and their each of these arrangements are different. They're unique by partners, so certain partners are performing better than others. Certain ones have volume-based measures as well. So it really depends upon where that volume goes and the performance of the individual portfolio. So, that is the main driver. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe if you could just go back to your comments on reserve levels and reserve adequacy and where we go from here. I get that your reserves, you seem to be indicating that, that you feel comfortable with your reserve ratios and you are, I think still about 40, 50 basis points, if I'm not mistaken, above your day one CECL allowance levels. But you are expecting NCOs to normalize and, and move higher. I would expect your losses that'll flow through your reasonable supportable period will be moving higher as we move forward. But just maybe you can comment on your reserve outlook going forward and what would induce you to maybe build reserves. What would need to happen for some additional reserve builds above and beyond what you need for growth? Brian Wenzel : So, the way I would think about the reserve as we move forward is you should see a rotation as you stabilize in delinquencies in this normalization period that the quantitative model absorbs that trend line. And then as we get more comfortable with the macro backdrops, the effects of inflation, as student loans, if they have an impact flow through the portfolio, you'll see the qualitative piece begin to come down, and effectively offset that and then you'll move down. Ultimately, we think towards that day one level. If the assumptions come in generally as we think about it, if you think about incremental provisioning on a rate basis here, again, most of the times we're talking about things that are growth driven in the portfolio, but truly rate driven ones. The couple of factors that we look at is clearly if you have a deterioration in collection performance that could do it mainly that's associated a lot of times with unemployment claims rising. So, that could be a second factor that kind of goes in there. But collection, performance and unemployment claims are two of probably the bigger ones that we'd see. Again, we haven't seen trends in collections that would warrant that today. So, we feel good about that. And unemployment claims have still remained historically low. So again, we think we factored into our reserve at the end of the third quarter qualitative as assessments for a potentially deteriorating macro, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. Operator : And we are allotted time for questions today. So we will take our final question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. I'll be quick, look like your share buybacks came down just a touch. You talk about the, your outlook for buybacks in the quarters ahead. Brian Wenzel : Yes. First of all, Arren, glad we were able to get your question in. With regard to the backs, we generally do not give or we have not given quarterly guidance with regard to how their purchase flow out for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $850 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization as we move to the end of the capital year in June of next year. What I probably want to be clear about with regard to that level for a second is what's not really driving the dollar amount. So I just really want to be clear that it's not related to a change in the macro environment for us, number one. Two, it's not related to any potential proposals on late fees. And then three, it's not related to Basel III end game. We have a set of mile markers that we've set out in the capital plan that's more RWA based and then how our income kind of comes in versus planned. So those are the factors. And again, we consider the other factors but that was not purchases. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you.",

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Currently, all callers have been placed in listen-only mode. The call will be opened up for your questions following the conclusion of management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements.

Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn. Good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong fourth quarter results, including net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5%, and a return on tangible common equity of 14.7%. These fourth quarter results contributed to full year 2023 net earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.19 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2%, and a return on tangible common equity of 19.8%. This strong financial performance was supported by continued consumer resilience empowered by our multiproduct strategy and diversified sales platforms. We achieved another year of record purchase volume, totaling $185 billion for the full year and up 3% from last year. Our compelling products and value propositions helped drive the origination of almost 23 million new accounts in 2023, and also helped grow our average active accounts by 2.5%. The broad utility and value of our product offerings continue to resonate deeply with our customer base, leading to another year of record purchase volume. This combined with a continued moderation in payment rates to drive loan receivables growth of 11.4%. Credit continued to normalize this fourth quarter, net charge-offs reached pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations and contributing to a full-year net charge-off rate of 4.87%, still below our target underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. We also drove continued progress toward our target operating efficiency ratio demonstrating cost discipline, while maintaining investments to ensure the long-term success of our franchise. And through strong execution and prudent capital management over time, Synchrony continued our long history of capital returns, including $1.5 billion returned to shareholders this year. Since 2016, we have paid $3.6 billion in dividends and reduced our outstanding shares by 50%. Synchrony's ability to consistently generate and return capital to our shareholders is enabled by our differentiated business model, which prioritizes the sustained delivery of attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions and economic cycles. Our focused execution across key strategic priorities enabled Synchrony's resilient returns by reinforcing our core strengths and facilitating our ongoing evolution to meet changing preferences and needs. With that in mind, Synchrony continued to grow and win new partners over the past year, with the addition of more than 25 partners and over 30 renewed relationships. Among our new partnerships, we were excited to announce that J.Crew selected Synchrony to launch its first co-branded credit card, which will be a digital-first program with mobile wallet provisioning, robust pre-approval capabilities, scan-to-apply, and direct-to-device credit applications. This competitive win is a testament to our culture of innovation, consistent investment in our digital ecosystem, and a strategic focus to empower our customers and partners to connect seamlessly through best-in-class omnichannel experiences. We also continued to diversify our programs, products, and markets during 2023. Broadening the utility of our offerings and extending our reach. Synchrony believes in the power of choice, choice for our customers and partners, providers, and merchants as they engage in-person and digitally across a full suite of everyday financing options. This year, we launched multiproduct pre-qualification and began presenting customers with side-by-side offers of both revolving and installment solutions to bring choice to the forefront. These enhancements empower customers to weigh the benefits of various options in real time and make the decisions that best suit their financing needs in that moment. We continue to scale our pay later solutions, which is now offered at over 200 provider locations in our health and wellness platform and at 18 retail partners. For our partners and providers, pay later seamlessly integrates into the broader partner relationship and product offering and provides another tool for deepening engagement with customers and the response has been strong. Since we launched, partners who have offered these solutions have seen a 20% lift in new accounts, with 95% of pay later sales coming from net new customers. Synchrony's continued diversification and expansion of our offerings over the last year benefited from opportunities to extend our reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of our Pets Best insurance business and through a minority interest from that sale, the opportunity to build a strategic partnership with Independence Pet Holdings or IPH, one of the leading pet-focused companies in North America. Since acquiring the Pets Best business in 2019, we've grown pets in force by over 45% per year on average, more than double the industry's growth rate to become a leading pet insurance provider in the US. We're very proud of what we've been able to achieve with such a great business and team, which enabled us to gain considerable insight into the pet industry more broadly over the last four years and we are confident that IPH will be able to use its pet insurance expertise to unlock new opportunities for Pets Best and offer still greater value for Pets Best customers. And through the strategic relationship forged between IPH and ourselves, Synchrony is positioned to gain still greater exposure and insights into the rapidly growing pet industry, as we seek to expand access to flexible pet care financing across the country. More recently Synchrony announced still another opportunity to expand our business and accelerate our growth with the acquisition of Ally Lending's point-of-sale financing business. This $2.2 billion loan portfolio consists of partnerships with nearly 2,500 merchant locations, and supports more than 450,000 active borrowers in home improvement services and healthcare industries. Through this acquisition, Synchrony will create a differentiated solution in the industry, simultaneously offering both revolving credit and installment loans at the point-of-sale in the home-improvement vertical. This multiproduct presentation furthers our product diversification strategy, delivering consumer choice while maximizing conversions and sales for our partners. This opportunity also enables Synchrony to expand our home specialty financing in roofing, windows, and electrical services. We are excited about the natural synergies we see between Ally Lending and Synchrony's Home & Auto, and Health & Wellness platforms. We look forward to leveraging our industry expertise and scale to drive operating efficiency and accelerate growth across platforms with attractive market opportunities and return profiles over time. And of course, Synchrony's ability to successfully deliver a breadth of financing solutions across an expansive distribution network is reliant on delivering best-in-class experiences with each customer interaction. This year, we continue to elevate the presence and utility of our offerings across in-person and digital transactions by adding digital wallet provisioning capabilities for eight partners, including PayPal and Venmo, Verizon, TJX and Belk. And our digital sales continued to grow at an outsized pace, climbing 9% to nearly 39% of our total 2023 sales. Over the last year, Synchrony launched the first phase of our marketplace on synchrony.com and within our native app where shoppers can find hundreds of offers showcasing our partner brands paired with Synchrony's tailored multiproduct financing solutions. In fact, as Synchrony leveraged our analytics and marketing capabilities to develop compelling cross-shopping opportunities in this initial launch, marketplace attracted over 220 million visits by shoppers for our partners, providers, and merchants, as we more than doubled the number of partners participating. In summary, Synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customer is looking to make a purchase or a payment, large or small, in-person or digitally, and across an ever-expanding range of markets and industries. We can meet them whenever and however they want to be met with a variety of flexible financing solutions to meet their needs in any given moment. Our ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners and providers alike is what positioned Synchrony so well to sustainably grow and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns, particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. Synchrony's fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of our differentiated business and financial model performing as designed. Our diversified sales platform and spend categories enabled record purchase volume growth as our disciplined underwriting and credit management kept credit performance in line with our expectations. Our retail share arrangements ensured alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners. As credit normalized towards historical pre-pandemic levels, and funding costs increased from higher benchmark rates, our RSA payments were lower, providing a partial buffer to the economic environment, and enabling Synchrony delivery of consistent attractive risk-adjusted returns. And our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to return capital to shareholders, while investing in opportunities to achieve our longer-term strategic goals, all while delivering for our customers and partners and their evolving needs today. Overall, our prudent business management and differentiated financial model have positioned Synchrony to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers, partners, and shareholders through an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop this past year and as we move forward in 2024. Now, let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Purchase volume increased 3% versus last year and reflected the breadth and depth of our sales platforms and the compelling value our products offer to bind with a resilient consumer. In Health & Wellness, purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts, led by dental, pet, and cosmetic verticals. Digital purchase volume increased 5% with growth in average active accounts and strong customer engagement. Diversified value purchase volume increased 4%, reflecting a higher in and out of partner spend. Lifestyle purchase volume increased 3%, with stronger average transaction values in Outdoor and Luxury. In our Home & Auto, purchase volume decreased 4%, as lower customer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases, and lower gas prices more than offset growth in Home Specialty, Auto network, and commercial. Purchase volume across Synchrony Dual and co-branded cards grew 9% and represented 43% of total purchase volume for the quarter, reflecting the broad utility and value that these products deliver for our customers. As we've discussed in the past, our out-of-partner spend is split roughly evenly between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. And this trend held steady throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw assumptions in categories, as consumers shifted from travel spend to clothing for instance and from gasoline and automobiles towards spend at grocery and discount stores. We've not seen any meaningful changes in the overall composition between discretionary and non-discretionary spend. The combination of broad-based purchase volume growth and approximately 110 basis-point decrease in payment rates drove ending loan receivables growth of 11.4%. Our fourth quarter payment rate of 15.9% still remains approximately 115 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic historical average. Net interest income increased 9% to $4.5 billion, driven by 16% growth in interest and fees. The increase in interest and fees reflected the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates, as well as a lower payment rate. Our net interest margin of 15.10% declined 48 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease largely reflected higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 169 basis points to 4.55% and reduced net interest margin by 138 basis points. This impact was partially offset by 66 basis points of growth in loan receivables yields, which contributed 55 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield added 29 basis points to net interest margin. And our loan receivables growth improved the mix of interest-earning assets, contributing 6 basis points to net interest margin. RSAs of $878 million in the fourth quarter or 3.49% of average loan receivables, a reduction of $165 million versus the prior year reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $402 million reserve build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables. Other expenses grew 14% to $1.3 billion. The increase primarily reflected growth-related items as we continue to see strong growth in volumes as well as the return of operational losses to pre-pandemic average levels as a percent of our purchase volume. Expenses in the quarter also included several notable items, including $43 million in employee costs related to a voluntary early retirement program, $9 million in real-estate-related restructuring charges as we continue to adjust our physical footprint in favor of hybrid working environment, $9 million for the FDIC's special assessment, $7 million of preparatory expenses in anticipation of a potential late fee rule change and $5 million of transaction-related expenses related to the sale of Pets Best. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter improved by approximately 120 basis points compared to last year to 36%. Excluding the impact of the notable items in the quarter, our efficiency ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points lower in the fourth quarter. All-in, Synchrony generated a net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5%, and a return on tangible common equity of 14.7%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. Overall, we see the consumer remaining resilient as we managed through inflation and higher interest rates. The external deposit data we monitor also supports this view, as it shows average savings account balances return closer to pre-pandemic levels during 2023 and remained relatively steady through the third and fourth quarters. At year-end, average industry savings balances remained approximately 9% above levels from 2020. Our disciplined through-cycle underwriting and active credit management has positioned us well as we enter 2024. Our delinquency ratios finished the year slightly above average levels from 2017 to 2019 prior to the pandemic. At year-end, our 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.74% compared to 3.65% in the prior year and 12 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our 90 plus delinquency rate was 2.28% versus 1.69% last year and 4 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. And consistent with our expectations, Synchrony's net charge-offs reached 5.58% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.48% in the prior year and an average of 5.49% in the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019. We continue to monitor our portfolio and implement actions as necessary to proactively position our business for 2024 and beyond. Moving to reserves, our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.26% down 14 basis points from 10.40% in the third quarter. The reserve build of $402 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth. Turning to slide 12, Synchrony's balance sheet continues to be a source of flexibility and strength. Our consumer bank offerings continued to resonate with customers in the fourth quarter, driving over $3 billion of growth in total deposits in the quarter or 13% compared to the prior year. At quarter-end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding, while securitized debt comprised 7% and unsecured funding 9%. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $19.8 billion, up $2.6 billion from last year and at quarter-end, represented 16.8% of total assets, up 42 basis points from last year. Moving on to our capital ratios, as a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will continue to make its annual transitional adjustments to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points each January until 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, Synchrony made a change to its balance sheet presentation of contractual amounts related to our retailer partner agreements. At year-end, assets of approximately $500 million, which were previously classified as intangible assets, were reclassified to other assets and prior periods were reclassified to conform to this presentation. This change in presentation had a corresponding impact to each of our regulatory capital metrics and resulted in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our capital ratios in both the current and prior years. Under the CECL transition rules and including this balance sheet change, we ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, 110 basis points lower than last year's 13.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.9% compared to 14.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 60 basis points to 14.9%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.1% compared to 22.8% last year. During the fourth quarter, we returned $353 million to shareholders, consisting of $250 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We remain well-positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure, through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow. Synchrony remains committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes investment in organic growth and payment of our regular dividends, followed by share repurchases and investments in inorganic growth opportunities where the rates of return meet or exceed that of our other potential uses of capital. To that end, as Brian mentioned, Synchrony announced the acquisition of the Ally Lending point-of-sale financing business, which we view as a great opportunity to expand our leadership position in home improvement and health and wellness verticals, while leveraging our industry expertise and scale to unlock still greater value. We've agreed to purchase approximately $2.2 billion of loan receivables at a discount. Upon closing the transaction and subject to completion of purchase accounting, we expect our CET1 ratio to be reduced by approximately 50 basis points inclusive of our provision for credit losses of approximately $200 million relating to the initial reserve builds. Synchrony expects this acquisition to be accretive to full-year 2024 earnings per share excluding the impact of the initial reserve build for credit losses. Upon integration of our business, conversion to our PRISM underwriting model and execution of our strategy, we expect to achieve attractive internal rate of return with approximately 3.5-year tangible book value earn back. Additionally, the sale of our Pets Best business will result in approximately $750 million gain net of tax in 2024, which will contribute to an approximately 80 basis-point increase to our CET1 ratio, inclusive of the capital required to be held on minority interest in IPH. Excluding the gain on sale, we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings. We're excited about the opportunities we\u2019ve identified to continue to drive consistent growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns, and have established a long track record of execution across both strategic and financial objectives. During 2023, we drove strong growth in purchase volume, which combined with the payment rate moderation to deliver solid growth in loan receivables. We were opportunistic in funding net growth and continue to expand our deposit franchise and in turn delivered attractive net interest income. Credit normalized in line with our expectations and our RSA functioned as designed. And finally, we fulfilled our commitment to deliver positive operating leverage. Turning to Slide 14, let's review our outlook for 2024. Our baseline assumption for this discussion include a stable macroeconomic environment, full-year GDP growth of approximately 1.7%, a year-end 2024 unemployment rate of 4.0%, and an ending Fed funds rate of 4.75% with cuts beginning in the second half of 2024. This outlook also assumes the closing our Pets Best and Ally Lending transactions in the first quarter of 2024. And given the uncertainty of timing and implementation of a potential final rule regarding late fees, we've not assumed any related impact to our 2024 financial outlook. In the event that the final late fee rule is published, we will provide an update with the associated impact to our financial guidance. Starting with loan receivables, we expect our compelling value propositions and the broad utility of our products will continue to drive purchase volume growth. We also expect payment rates to continue to moderate although we anticipate they will remain above pre-pandemic levels through 2024. Together, these dynamics should deliver ending loan receivables growth of 6% to 8%. We expect full-year net interest income of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. Net interest income should follow typical seasonal trends through the year, adjusted for several impacts. One, higher interest-bearing liabilities expense as our fixed-rate debt re-prices with higher benchmark rates. Two, the impact of competition for retail deposits and pace of deposit repricing once rate cuts begin. Our expectation is for betas to trend near 30%, as rates begin to decline later in the year, thereby reducing impact to interest expense during 2024. And three, interest and fee yield growth, partially offset by higher income reversals. We expect net charge-offs of 5.75% to 6%, within our targeted underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. Losses are expected to peak in the first half before returning to pre-pandemic seasonal trends following the normalization of delinquency metrics in 2023. We expect RSAs of 3.5% to 3.75% of average loan receivables for the full year. This reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, higher interest expense and the mix of our loan receivables growth, partially offset by purchase volume growth. The reduction in RSA demonstrates the functional design of the RSA and the continued alignment of interest with partners. And finally, we expect to reach an operating efficiency ratio of 32.5% to 33.5% for the year driven primarily by the optimization of our loan yields as credit normalization occurs. This outlook excludes the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale, which we recognized in other income. We remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year and continuing to invest in our long term success of our business. As demonstrated again this past year, Synchrony's purpose-built business and financial model is performing as designed. Through an evolving backdrop, our diversified portfolio of products and platforms continue to drive growth. Our leading credit management ensures attractive risk-adjusted returns, our RSA provides a buffer against changes in economic performance and our stable balance sheet creates opportunity. Taken together, our business continued to deliver value for each of our stakeholders in 2023 and positioned well for 2024. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony delivered another strong performance in 2023. We executed on key strategic priorities that expand the breadth and depth of our customer acquisition and engagement, further diversify the products, services, and value we provide, and enhance the quality of the experiences we power for our customers, partners, providers, and merchants. This focus on deepening our core strengths while continuing to evolve with the ever-changing world of commerce has enabled Synchrony to deliver strong financial results and returns to our shareholders, while also preparing our business for the future. We are confident in our ability to continue to sustainably grow and deliver resilient risk-adjusted returns over time, and are excited about both the near and longer-term opportunities we see ahead to deliver still greater value for our many stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We'll take our first question from Terry Ma with Barclays. Please go-ahead. Terry Ma : Thanks, good morning. Can you maybe just talk about the cadence we should expect for delinquencies in 2024? Should the fourth quarter or first quarter be kind of peak delinquencies? And then as we look forward out to 2025, can you maybe just talk about your confidence level that you'll stay within this net charge-off range of 5.75% to 6%? Brian Wenzel : Sure. Thanks, Terry. When we look at our delinquency formation and really in the fourth quarter, first I think you have to recognize we normalize slower than all of our peers, which is partially attributable to the fact that we didn't really adjust the credit box during the pandemic. Our advanced underwriting tool PRISM, which we invested heavily in since 2017 and the data elements we bring in. So that really helped the formation as we exit out of 2023. It's important to note that when you look at both the 30 plus and 90 plus delinquency rate, that is in the fourth quarter, they're only 12 basis points and 4 basis points respectively over the three-year average from 2017 to 2019. And then when I look at the mix of credit that sits in delinquency today, it's substantially similar to that of the 2019 credit mix. So, when I look at that, I then look at little bit at the trending, Terry, and performance of delinquency. When you look at it, the consistency of the growth month-on-month, year-over-year, 30 plus and 90 plus has not shown deterioration. It has been very consistent, a range between 109 basis points and 116 basis points each month. 90 plus has been between 55 basis points and 63 basis points. So, it's been very consistent. Relative to seasonality, it has been generally in line. So I look at those factors as we kind of -- entry rate continues to be better than 2019. So now, as I roll that forward, what we expect from a charge-off perspective is that your first-half charge-offs are going to be higher in the first half, lower in second half, and should give you a range of 5.75% to 6% for the year. So, inside of our underwriting target. Again, recall that we did take actions in the second quarter and third quarter, which we outlined. Those are beginning to see and you should see the effects of those beginning into affect delinquencies here in the first half of 2024. So with that, we feel good about where credit is. We'll continue to monitor the trends in credit, what's rolling in, but the positive entry rate, which has a slightly negative effect on the float to loss, but that positive entry rate is really encouraging for us as we enter the year. Terry Ma : Got it, thank you. And then my follow-up on just the NIM and NII guide. It looks like you assumed about two rate cuts. Can you maybe just talk about what we should expect if we get more than two rate cuts for the year? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks for that question, Terry. If I look at what we're projecting, we actually had three rate cuts, really beginning in September of 2024 going through the end of the year, which I hit the point on betas, it's 30%. So if you think about having rate cuts that late in the year, digital banks generally lag about 30 to 90 days with regard to when they start to move rates, and then you also have to take into consideration the fact that in the fourth quarter when we want to maintain higher level of financing to fund seasonal growth. So that's why the beta is a little bit lower. If you were to get rate increases either more than that early in the year, you would get in theory some benefit on to the net interest margin and lower interest on interest-bearing liabilities. Terry Ma : Got it. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Terry. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Thanks, everybody, for taking my questions this morning. Really just wanted to talk a little bit about the relationship between NCOs and RSAs when we look at the '24 guidance. '24 guidance from an NCO perspective basically puts you at the higher end but within the range of NCO targets. RSA looks a little bit lower than what we would have seen on a pre-pandemic basis. And I'm assuming that's really not a function of credit, but more a function of interest rates. And as we look forward, if we assume net charge-offs wind up in that 5.5% to 6% target range, but interest rates start to come down, will the RSA trend back up? I just wanted to sort of get a sense of what we should be looking at in a normal environment for that RSA ratio. Brian Wenzel : Sure. Thank you, Rick. First thing, I am going to continue to point you to Page 4 of our materials this morning, which shows the risk-adjusted return, really the relationship between NCOs and RSA, which generally trend in line with each other. You are right. As you think about 2024, you do see some lift continuing on the net charge-off line which pulls back through the RSA, you continue to get headwinds as the interest-bearing liabilities will reset. We have -- 92% of our CDs will reset in 2024, 74% of our debt will reset in 2024. So you're going to have a full-year effect of the rate increases that we've seen in 2022 and 2023 flow through the book. And again, we're expecting -- I think in the guidance, we said, listen, payment rate does not get back to pre-pandemic levels. So you're not getting the full interest and fee yields going back through, you have higher interest-bearing liabilities, which will in theory benefit the company through a low RSA to the extent that interest-bearing liabilities comes down faster through other resets, you would see an increase to the RSA. Rick Shane : Great. That's it from me. Thank you guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Rick. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Rick. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Good morning, guys. Brian Doubles : Good morning, Ryan. Brian Wenzel : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Brian, maybe as a follow-up to the first question. I just wanted to flush out the NII and NIM guide a little bit more. Can you maybe just talk about, one, what gets us to the bottom end of the range to the top of the range, obviously, it's a pretty wide range and maybe just explain a little bit further, what is the 30% beta? Is that a point-to-point? Is that a downside? I just want to make sure we fully understand that. And lastly, just given that you are liability-sensitive on the way up, do you still see a path to a 16% NIM and over what timeframe? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ryan. So let me deal with the beta comment first. So, when you think about beta, this is really the beta in year for really effectively the end of the year. I think, if you think about betas over a longer period of time, so think about what you would see in any rate declined cycle here. I would not expect a beta one, we didn't get one on the way up. So, we wouldn't get one on the way down. When you look at our book of -- our portfolio of liabilities, we were approximately 80% beta on savings, 90% beta on CDs. I would expect that over that cycle coming down. So, over time, you're going to see it kind of probably mirror the way it went up, it will mirror on the way down. So, that's how I would think about betas over the over the longer-term. When you think about the net interest income, the question here becomes, what is the assumption? If you go -- we have three rate cuts in and the market has six, some have as early as March. So, most certainly, if interest-bearing liabilities starts earlier and there is greater rate declines, that could push your NII dollars up. Conversely, if rates don't get cut off, it could push you a little bit lower. And the big other factor that\u2019s going to come through here is going to be what this payment rate continue to do. We have been conservative, I think on payment rate, saying it doesn't get back to pre-pandemic levels. I think it's been slower than our anticipated decline here in 2023. So those are generally the moving pieces as I think how you slide between a range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe as a follow-up on credit, you talked about starting to see delinquencies follow more normal patterns and also [charge-offs] (ph) speaking by the second-quarter. Brian, if your outlook proves to be correct, when do we start to see the allowance coming down? When does it peak and come down? And maybe just help us understand the potential magnitude that it could come down over the course of the year. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yeah. So we're entering the year at 10.26% on a coverage rate basis. I would expect in the first quarter, you're going to see a rise in normally seasonally rises, receivables go down, number 1. Number 2 is [Technical Difficulty] of just under $200 million, around $200 million for the Ally Lending portfolio that we bring over. There will be some on the purchase accounting marks that will increase that coverage rate a little bit as well it doesn't go through the P&L. So you're going to see a rise really in the first-quarter, call it, seasonally. We anticipate that it will be lower than 10.26% as we exit out of [2024] (ph). So you're primarily going to see growth builds as we move throughout the year, but you will see rate declines. Some of the QAs burn-off or get realized. And again, if credit performs as we think it would, you\u2019d be exiting down towards the day-one, we won't be at day-one most certainly in 2024, but trending downwards as we move through the year. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color, Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. I know that your guidance doesn't contemplate the late fee ruling yet because it hasn't been issued, but maybe could you -- you did mention that you spent $7 billion kind of in preparation. Could you talk about the things that you are doing in preparation and kind of any updated thoughts you have on the fact, that we're sitting here kind of in that towards the end of January and haven\u2019t heard anything yet from the CFPB? Brian Doubles : Yeah, sure, Moshe. I'll start on this. We're obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued, but with that said, while there still some unknowns in terms of the implementation period and other things that we'll see in the final rule, we've been working on this for almost a full-year now at this point. It's very complicated. Our teams have done a lot of work in preparation for this. We spent a lot of time with our partners. We've agreed on pricing actions and offsets that we would deploy when we see the final rule. So it's really all the work that has been going on over the past year. I mean it's systems work. You've got to issue a lot of CITs, change in terms. And so it's really that kind of stuff. I will say that the conversations with our partners have been very constructive. They fully recognize that without these offsets, that a meaningful portion of their customers that we approve today and that we underwrite and give credit to would no longer have access to credit. And that's something clearly we do not want, they do not want. So really no change to what we said in the past. Our goal is to protect our partners, fully offset the impact of the final rule when it does come. And we want to continue to provide credit to the customers that we do today. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. And just as a kind of as a second thought, when you look at the different kind of verticals, obviously you had strong growth in 2023, and a couple of them in Home & Auto had been somewhat weaker, particularly as you got closer to year end. As you look into 2024, any changes in mix in terms of the growth, anything that you're seeing for launches and product refreshes that are going to drive in those various lines? Brian Doubles : Yeah, I think, look, generally we would continue to expect outsized growth in Health & Wellness. That's a platform where we've accelerated investment in the past year or two. We're seeing really good growth from our acquisition of Allegro Credit. It's a big market. We've got a leading position. This is dental, vet, cosmetic, great engagement with partner network. And so that's a platform we'll continue to invest in, and we would expect to see growth there on the higher side relative to the other platforms. The other one I would mention is digital. That's where we've got Venmo, Verizon, PayPal, Amazon, and so I think you'd continue to see some outsized growth there. And then maybe a little bit softer in lifestyle and home and auto. I don't know, Brian, if you\u2019d add anything to that. Brian Wenzel : No, you'll see Health & Wellness and digital will be above average. Diversified value will be around company average, maybe a hair below, and then you'll see lifestyle. And listen, the home and auto trend, particularly in the home, what we're seeing there is lower foot traffic in the store, and we see frequency not necessarily terribly down but it's more transaction values. Our people are -- they're buying a mattress, they're not buying high-end mattress, they're buying a little bit lower. So we would expect that trend to continue into the start of 2024. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Moshe. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Moshe. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess one other question I have is, I think we've had depleted recoveries on the charge-offs side, part of that equation over the past couple of years. I'm wondering, Brian, to what degree does maybe a recovery and recoveries impact the NCO guide? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. Thanks for the question, John, and good morning. When we look at recoveries, we've done a couple of things really through the pandemic. Number one, we made a strategic shift to in-source our recovery operations. So we used to have a lot of it externally managed, we brought it in-house, which effectively drove rate increases on the ultimate recoverability of dollars written off, so that was a positive as we move through. You are right, when you look at it, particularly when you're doing some level of forward flow, on a rate basis, that's down and your total charge-offs are down, but I think the swing that we had of being more efficient by in-sourcing has helped to offset that. So, I think on a relative percentage, it's been flat. Most certainly, it should rise as we step out of 2023 for a couple of reasons. Number one, you're right, we will get more volume just on the net charge-off basis. And then if you do see an easing of rates, the cost of capital associated with people who purchase written-off paper should go down and you get better pricing in the market. So, there's a number of different dynamics for us that it hasn't been much of an issue on net charge-offs and probably exiting out of '24 maybe provides a tailwind beyond. John Hecht : Okay, and maybe kind of a higher-level question. I think, Brian, I think you mentioned non-discretionary versus discretionary purchase activity was consistent. I'm wondering, I mean, given inflation is stabilizing, we got student loan repayment turn back on, are you seeing anything on the margin that would reflect changing consumer behaviors? Is it just sort of been steady-as-she-goes given those changes in the macro? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, as we highlighted, John, what we're seeing is a little bit of a rotation out of some of travel into some of the other items. Again, that was a trend more in the fourth quarter. We would expect travel to ease as you move into 2024, so that's bigger. So, we do not see the shift between discretionary and nondiscretionary. We do not see a shift where the consumer is trying to really stretch dollars. We do see our transaction values down and frequency up a little bit, which means that as the consumers are making purchases, they are trying to be efficient with the dollars, but not really, really pulling back. So, as I look at it that, I don't see big overwhelming trends. I would tell you, for the first 20 days and I always put that as a frame of reference, sales have been a little bit softer than expectations as we entered into 2024, but that's only 20 days of data and If I talk to some of my retail rent, they would tell you whether did play a factor, you had several states that have been cold and significant storms. But there has been lower foot traffic generally across the board as we started 2024. John Hecht : Great. Appreciate the color. Brian Doubles : Thanks, John. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go-ahead. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe to start with, I wanted to ask about portfolio renewals and just portfolio movements. And I apologize, a two-part question. But firstly, can you just remind us of your renewal cadence? Are there any large programs coming up for renewal here in the next 24 months? And then second part is just we've gone through a period of credit normalization, you still have the late fee rule outstanding. So I was wondering what the environment is like for renewals and RFPs currently as you talk to retailers? Are retailers waiting for a little bit more certainty or -- I mean I know you announced J.Crew this morning, you also buying the Ally portfolio. But, like, what about the other big retail programs? [indiscernible] like, can you put your pipeline in context maybe, like, what it looks like and just put that into context for us relative to last year or few years ago or normal environment? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yeah, so I would say, first, I'll take the second part first, which is late fees and how that's impacting the pipeline. I do think it does make pricing new business, even renewals to some extent, a little more challenging. But we've been able to kind of work through that. You mentioned J.Crew. We're excited to announce that new program. But you've got to spend time. That's part of the negotiation, right? And there's speculation there and there's some uncertainty. And so you kind of got to try and cover yourself for those possible outcomes, which we believe we've done. So it does make, I think, pricing new business or renewals a little more challenging. I do think there'll be some clarity here in the next month or two, and that will clear that up and make things a little bit easier from that perspective. But it has influenced, I think, not only us, but other market participants. It's a big part of the conversation when she gets through. The way I think about the kind of the BD or the sales process, it's a lot about capabilities, technology, data analytics, data share, all those things. But then when you get to the financials, this is a big part of the discussion that's crept in there over the last 12 months just given the uncertainty. The other thing, just in terms of our pipeline for renewals, the vast majority of our programs are out there 2026 and beyond. With that said, if we have an opportunity, as always, if we have an opportunity to renew early, if there's something the partner wants to change in the deal or something we want to change, we'll get together and see if we can kick the term out a few years. So that's something we're always actively trying to work on with our partners. Brian Wenzel : Yeah, the only thing I'll answer is or just add, but you'll see in February, again, we'll continue to update the revenue that's under contract in \u201826 and beyond. So expect that in February. Mihir Bhatia : Excellent. Thank you. And then just switching gears, in terms of the health of the consumer, it sounds like stable, still feel pretty good about it. So I was wondering about your underwriting posture here. Clearly, soft landing is becoming more of a consensus view. I know you aren't prone to big gyrations there, but how are you feeling about that underwriting posture? Maybe just talk about like what your standards look like today versus maybe one year ago or even 2019. Is this like 2024 like more of a normal year? Is it still a little on the tight side and the opportunity to loosen and drive growth? Just any comments there. Brian Wenzel : Yeah, here we are again, it\u2019s gotten a lot of issues and troubles they've tried to underwrite growth in \u201821 and \u201822 vintages, which people are paying the price for now. Some refer to it as growth mass. Some refer to it as losing standards and lower returns. So we're not going to use credit as a mere growth lever for us, we are more proven than we were a year ago. Again, we talked about we do idiosyncratic actions on partners and channels, I don't want to say every day, but most certainly we watch it every day. We took broader based actions both in 2Q and 3Q given the shared consumer and what other people have done from an underwriting basis. We were slightly encouraged in the fourth quarter as we've seen at the bureaus that other issuers have begun to take credit actions, which will benefit the industry in the latter part of 2024. But I think we're going to be cautious as we move throughout the year. We're going to continue to watch the trends of the consumer. Again, we haven't seen the consumer stretch. When we look at payment rates, the payment rate movements by credit rate have been relatively consistent, and probably the biggest mover has been in the [6.60 to 7.20] (ph) range, which you'd see in a non-prime person. So again, we look at it and say, okay, I don't see the consumer stretching from a spending standpoint and struggling. We don't see the payment rate changing. We're going to continue to watch the flow and the delinquency. Again, entry rate continues to be better than 2019, which again, the flow to loss gets worse whenever entry rate goes down. But we generally -- we're generally cautiously optimistic on credit, and which is reflected in the guide of 5.75% to 6%. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Mihir. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Brian Doubles, you were pretty active on the transactions front with the sale of the pet insurance business and part of the business and then the acquisition of the Ally Lending business. Could you just maybe a little bit more on what drove those decisions and then what the pipeline for other deals look like? I mean, I think there's one big fish at least out there in terms of a portfolio. So, can you just talk about what the positioning is there? Brian Doubles : Yeah, let me -- well, why don\u2019t I start with Ally because it's the more recent of the two transactions. I mean, look, I think we're super excited about this acquisition. I think it's actually great for both companies. These were conversations that JB and I started back in the first half of \u201823. I think this wasn't a scale business for Ally, but on our side, this is absolutely a scale business. This is exactly the type of acquisition that we look for. These are businesses and industries that we know really well. We obviously have a presence already in home improvement and health and wellness. In fact, as we got into this, we realized that we serve some of the same partners. So as I think about Ally, it really just complements and accelerates our current strategy. I also think that, and Brian covered this, got a very attractive financial profile, it\u2019s EPS accretive, it's got a nice ROA that'll be in line or maybe a little bit better than the company average. We get 2,500 new merchants. We get 500,000 new customers. So there's really a lot to like here. I mean, this is a nice bolt-on acquisition for us and will be a nice ad for both Home & Auto, but also Health & Wellness. And then Pets Best was really more opportunistic. We weren't looking to sell the pet insurance business. It's been a great business for us. We're obviously creating a lot of value in a relatively short period of time We did a great job growing the business. From 2019, we grew the pets in force over 5x. We took the business to number seven or number eight to the number four pet insurance provider in the US. And when IPH approached us, it was a great offer, tough to turn it down. It's over 10x our original investment. We'll record a nice after-tax gain. But I think more importantly than that, it allows us to stay invested in the pet space and do it with someone, a great partner like IPH that has the scale, that has the expertise. And so we think there's not only a nice financial gain, but a long-term strategic play here that will benefit us. So it's a nice way to close out the year with two, I think, really great transactions. Sanjay Sakhrani : Other deals? What else is out there? Brian Doubles : Sorry, Sanjay, one more? Say that again? Sanjay Sakhrani : Yeah, you were saying -- I asked, sir, what else might be out there? One big portfolio out there right now. Brian Doubles : Yeah. Look, we got a lot on our plate. I'd start with that. We got to get both of these transactions closed, which we hope to do in the first quarter. We got a lot going on in 2024, for sure. With that said, we typically get invited into most RFPs in this space and the things that are important to us haven't changed. We look for a good risk adjusted return. We look for really good alignment with the partner. I think that's probably the most important thing, particularly when you're looking at large deals. You've got to make sure that both partners like the deal in good times and bad times, that our interests are aligned around marketing and credit and underwriting and really all aspects of the program. So we'll always be in the market for opportunities that fit that screen. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. And just one follow-up. I guess, Brian Wenzel, like in your reserve coverage, what do you -- or for the year, what are you assuming for the unemployment rate specifically? Brian Wenzel : The unemployment rate as we exit out of 2024 is 4%. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. All right, great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Sanjay. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Adelson : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Last year you ended up seeing your loan growth come in about the initial expectations of that kind of initial 8% to 10%. I guess I'm wondering if you think there's maybe some potential upside or a similar setup this year? And then more specifically, could you talk a little bit more about the specific drivers that you see getting you to the low end versus the high end of the range there in that 6% to 8% in terms of payment rate, consumer spend, new account growth, and maybe even how additive you think that this installment opportunity could be to your growth? It seems like you're maybe leaning in a little bit more here with the acquisition and the pre-qualification launch this year. Brian Wenzel : Yeah, when I look at the growth rate, Jeff, what gets you to the lower end of the range is a couple of things potentially, right? A softer consumer, right? The macroeconomic environment softens up, number one. Number two, payment rate remains more elevated than we anticipate. You'll be at the low -- could be at the lower end of that range. If we -- if the credit actions we've taken deliver more of a sales impact than we expect, again, it's not material in whole, that could put you lower than range. Conversely, as you think about the high end of the range, if payment rates decline faster than we think, number one. If you see the economy maybe be a little bit more robust than what we're seeing on -- we gave you GDP growth rate there, but the economy's a little more robust, and we see spending elevate. You can see some more there. With regard to, well, certainly the home specialty, that's been a vertical inside of Home & Auto that has grown nicely for us, will continue to grow nicely for us. It's really not going to move the company average, so it's a nice acquisition. The acquisition itself is not necessarily generally going to be material enough to move a lot of the underlying metrics. You'll get the pop day one and most certainly it will grow as we create the synergies between our home specialty platform and what's a very attractive Ally Lending point of sale platform. So the combination will grow a little bit faster, but it shouldn't move the overall needle of the company. Jeff Adelson : Got it. And just to follow up on the new expense ratio guide, I know in the past you've given more of a quarterly dollar amount. It seems like you might be implying a pretty very low single digit type expense growth next year. Is that right and where do you think you're kind of gaining some efficiencies from here? Is it on marketing, lower comp, et cetera? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, so first of all, on the switch to really efficiency ratio, Jeff, if you recall a number of years ago, we were actually on efficiency ratio and that's what we guided long term. We pivot during the pandemic because of the implications to revenue, because of the payment rate dislocation that we saw. So we're trying to be more helpful to investors and analysts by going to dollars. Now we're just really migrating back to where we should be from an efficiency ratio standpoint and where the industry generally operates, number one. With regard to the expense dollars, if I look at controllable dollars, so if I take operational losses out, we can control them, but take that out for one second, and you remove marketing, which is more contractual for us based upon volume. We are growing expense at a slower rate. So we're getting operating leverage inside the company. We need several investments as you saw in our notable items, both on a voluntary early retirement program as well as some smaller but again, meaningful impacts to our facilities that will drive a benefit in 2024. So I think from a controllable expense standpoint, they're going to be -- you're going to see operating levers when it comes to that. With regard to operational losses, we've invested in some incremental tools that have there some new strategies. So we expect that growth rate to really flatten out as we move \u201823 to \u201824. Jeff Adelson : Great. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Jeff. Have a good day. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Just have a couple of follow-ups on the late fee topic. I guess in terms of the offsets, can you just remind us what is likely to be the most material mechanism in offsetting the impact of the late fees? Is it incremental fees or the underlying interest rates that you're dialing in? And then, secondly, how -- can you talk about the competition for negotiating the offsets that you indicated are in place? Is it, how heavy is it in terms of competition? Are there competitors out there willing to eat the cost? And could you possibly see any relationships move as a result of this? Brian Doubles : Yeah, let me start with the second one first. I think we're all on a level playing field here in terms of the new late fee proposal. So as we're in there trying to, whether it's a renewal or new business, the impact is the same. I think it all comes down to what is the issuers required rate of return, what are the things that are important to them. So I don't see it changing the competitive dynamic much because it impacts us all equally. It really depends on the type of portfolio, what's important to the partner, the sharing, the alignment, all the things I talked about. So I don't think it will have -- I don't see it having a big impact there. And particularly at the point at which we have some clarity here around a final rule, then I think it becomes even clearer in terms of what to bake in. And, Brian, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about the APRs and fees? Brian Wenzel : Yeah. So, obviously, John, we have a set of pricing strategy changes that will come through, some of which come through with a faster cadence in 2024, which will be fee oriented as well as some policy orientation. And then there will be APR increases that build with some of which you'll see in 2024 if the rule gets issued and then build into 2025. So we'll be back if the rule does get issued. We'll come back and probably provide a little bit more color with regard to how to think about that in the context of 2024. Some of these will have a bigger short-term impact, some of them will have a bigger long-term impact. And so, we'll be in a position to provide a little more clarity when we have a final rule and we start to roll out some of these actions. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. And then, secondly, just around your purchase volume, I appreciate the color you gave in terms of the drivers between the different verticals. Overall, as we're looking at 2024, what's your expectation for total card purchase volume or overall purchase volume as you look at the full year versus 2023, and the same for overall account growth? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yeah, so I'd say, we're not specifically guiding, John, on purchase volume. Obviously you've seen the rate of asset growth decline from 2023 to 2024, there was some impact last year really around that asset growth of -- stemming from payment rates decline, which again, we don't think it will have as big an impact in 2024. So I think you're going to see something generally consistent with probably last year. I mean, a good benchmark is sit back and say, we do see GDP at 1.7%. We grow multiple of that. So again, probably generally consistent with the last year. You've got to remember, too, our purchase volume at $185 billion for 2023 was a record high for this company. So we are facing a difficult comp as we move into 2024. But again, we're proud of the sales platforms and the differentiation and diversification that's inside of those platforms. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Have a good day. Operator : Our last question will come from Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries : Yeah, thanks. I wanted to ask about your thoughts around preferred equity issuance for this year. Brian, does that need to be additive to total capital levels or does it free you up to replace some of that with or return some common? Talk a little bit about potential timing, what you kind of need to see from a market perspective and also how much you might look to issue? Brian Wenzel : Yeah, thanks for the question, Mark. As we look at the capital stack, we fully developed our Tier 2. We have about 75 basis points, give or take, of capacity in Tier 1, which puts the max amount you probably can do just to reach the target level for Tier 1 of about $750 -- $700 million to $750 million, ultimately that you'd want to do. We don't necessarily think of that relative to common equity as more as we want to develop, most certainly the most cost-effective capital structure that we want, the timing of which is going to depend upon market conditions. Rates throughout 2023 were incredibly high and wasn't necessarily the best time to kind of issue it. We'll look at how the markets develop in 2024 and whether or not there's desire to invest or demand for the products. And we'll also look at the structure of whether or not that's a more retail-oriented preferred stock or not. So there's a number of different factors that go in. It just really goes into how do I fully develop all the levels of the capital stack from a regulatory standpoint. Mark DeVries : Okay, great. And then just to follow up on kind of your updated thoughts on plans for how to deploy the capital created by the Pets Best sale. Brian Wenzel : Yeah, I don't think our priorities change. We generated some capital in \u201823 by making some adjustments. We'll spend about 50 basis points of capital on the Ally transaction. We'll generate about 80 basis points on the Pets Best sale and net of the investment that we're taking back in IPH. So I think that kind of goes [on the pie] (ph). We will look to the priorities of organic growth, number one, maintaining the dividend, two, and then three, we'll look either at share of purchases or if there's other inorganic opportunities. Again, I think we're very focused when it comes to inorganic opportunities. It has to be the right thing. It has to be priced incredibly well, which we feel we got with Ally Lending. And so we'll be prudent when it comes to deploying that capital. But again, we're not changing the strategy or the cadence because of the Pets Best transaction. Mark DeVries : Got it. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Mark. Have a good day. Mark DeVries : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today Synchrony reported strong first quarter results, including the successful completion of 2 previously announced transactions, the sale of our Pets Best insurance business which generated an $802 million after-tax gain in the quarter and will extend our reach in the rapidly growing pet industry through a minority interest in international pet holdings we received as part of that sale and the acquisition of Ally Lending's $2.2 billion point-of-sale financing business, which will augment the existing offerings in our home and auto and health and wellness sales platforms. Together, these transactions expand Synchrony's differentiated offerings in the market and strengthen our position as the partner of choice as we drive long-term value for our many stakeholders.  Excluding the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale, Synchrony delivered adjusted first quarter net earnings of $491 million or $1.18 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.7% and a return on tangible common equity of 16.8%. This performance highlights the resiliency of Synchrony's earnings power over time as we deliver results while positioning the business for strong risk-adjusted growth ahead. Our differentiated model enables us to assess and react quickly through cycles and environments as our broad product suite, compelling value propositions and innovative technology continue to resonate with both our consumers and partners. We opened 4.8 million new accounts in the first quarter and grew average active accounts by 3%. Our products and value propositions drove $42 billion in first quarter purchase volume, 2% above the prior year and our highest ever first quarter performance.  Health & Wellness purchase volume increased 8% led by pet, dental and cosmetic and reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts. In diversifying value, purchase volume increased 4% driven by spend both at our partners and outside of our partners. Digital purchase volume increased 3%, reflecting continued consumer engagement through growth in average active accounts. In home and auto, purchase volume decreased 3% as the strong growth in home specialty and auto network and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition was offset by a combination of lower customer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and lower gas prices and lifestyle purchase volume decreased 4%, reflecting the impact of lower transaction values. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 6% as our value propositions continue to drive increased engagement and growth. Synchrony's out-of-partner spend reflects a comprehensive range of categories, industries and products and offers a deeper view into consumer behavior throughout the quarter. Spending in January was impacted by challenging weather conditions as average transaction frequencies declined 4% versus the prior year. In February and March, however, we saw a rebound, particularly in nondiscretionary categories. Overall, consumers focused on more nondiscretionary spend in the quarter and shifted out of certain discretionary categories like home furnishings, travel and entertainment.  Despite the change in mix over, we continue to see broad-based growth in many discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. Across the business, Synchrony continues to see indications that nonprime borrower spend has slowed, and our portfolio's purchase volume growth continues to be driven by higher credit grade consumers. Average transaction values among super prime borrowers continue to increase. And similarly, we see average transaction frequency growth from our prime and super prime segments. These relative adjustments in consumer spend behavior generally reflect a financially healthy consumer who is continuing to become more selective in their purchases and align their cash flows. A trend which has also Continued to take shape in Synchrony's credit performance. Portfolio payment rates continue to moderate and reached 15.8% for the first quarter, about 90 basis points lower than last year and about 60 basis points higher than the average payment rate level across our first quarters from 2015 to 2019. The relative pace of payment rate moderation has continued to slow from both a generational and credit grade perspective, which when combined with the spending trends we've observed reinforces our view that borrowers are generally reverting to spending and payment behaviors that are more consistent with pre-pandemic norms. These trends are also supported by a number of our other consumer financial health indicators, including a strong labor market and external deposit data that has shown relative stability across industry savings account balances.  Taken together, these dynamics are contributing to Synchrony's recent delinquency performance highlighted on Slide 11, where the year-over-year rate of change has slowed as our portfolio has reached pre-pandemic ranges. The normalization and recent stabilization of our delinquency performance has occurred at a more gradual pace than the majority of our industry peers, underscoring the powerful combination of our disciplined underwriting, advanced analytics and sophisticated credit management tools. We're encouraged by these trends and continue to expect our portfolios net charge-offs to peak in the first half of this year. We continually monitor indicators across our portfolio, along with the broader industry's credit performance and continue to take credit actions to optimize our portfolio's positioning for 2024 and beyond.  Synchrony utilizes a broad range of proprietary and external data, including payment behavior characteristics, billions of transactions and credit bureau alerts to deliver actionable insights that inform our underwriting, product and credit management strategies across the account, channel and portfolio levels. Our ability to leverage these insights and deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers and partners even as needs evolve and market conditions shift is what enables Synchrony to consistently deliver the outcomes that matter most for our many stakeholders and increasingly positions us as the partner of choice. To that end, Synchrony added or renewed more than 25 partners in the first quarter, including BRP and added 2 new technology partnerships with Adit practice management software and ServiceTitan.  We are excited about our new partnership with BRP, a global leader in powersports and marine products which will enable their U.S. dealers to offer secured installment loan products for their well-known line of powersports products, including the Ski-Doo, Sea-Doo, and CaN-Am on- and off-road vehicles. Synchrony will deliver our financing offers with flexible terms through their online or in dealership application process, highlighting our ability to address the diverse needs and preferences of our customers. And Synchrony's strategic technology partnerships with Adit practice management software and ServiceTitan each represent opportunities to drive seamless customer experiences while also expanding access to our diversified suite of financial solutions and services.  Synchrony's partnership with Adit, an industry-leading dental practice management software provider will expand CareCredit access to dental practices nationwide and includes integration with AditTech for patients, enabling a seamless and easy-to-use experience for both patients and practitioners. Connecting patients to payment solutions at their dentist office is an essential part of ensuring their care journey is as smooth as possible and dental practices benefit from more timely and effective revenue cycle management. Similarly, Synchrony will integrate with ServiceTitan, a leading software platform built to power trades businesses, enabling contractors to offer their home improvement financing through our direct-to-device application process.  By providing access to flexible financing at their fingertips, customers are empowered to make a choice that gets them closer to their goal while their contractors benefit from a frictionless sales experience. So whether we are building new relationships, or supporting and enhancing existing ones. Synchrony deeply understands what our customers need and expect and what our partners, merchants and providers are seeking to achieve. Our ability to deliver for these stakeholders and consistently achieved strong outcomes through varying conditions demonstrates the strength of Synchrony's business model and commitment of our incredible team. And speaking of our team, in today's world, it has never been more important for us to attract and retain the best talent, which we do to our unwavering commitment to our employees and our culture.  So I'm proud to share that we've been named among the top best companies to work for in the U.S. by Fortune magazine and Great Places to Work. Synchrony moved up 15 positions to #5 in the 2024 rankings, reflecting our unique and special culture and our relentless focus on putting people first, as we continuously strive to achieve best-in-class experiences for our many stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter results reflected the combination of our differentiated business model and a resilient consumer in an evolving macroeconomic environment. We generated $1.3 billion in net earnings or $3.14 per diluted share on a reported basis. Excluding the $802 million after-tax gain from the sale of our Pets Best business, we generated $491 million in net earnings or $1.18 per diluted share. Ending loan receivables grew 12% to $102 billion. This growth reflected the impacts of the continued purchase volume growth, an approximate 90 basis point decrease in payment rate and the completion of our Ally Lending acquisition.  Net revenue increased $1.6 billion or 50%, driven by the Pets Best gain on sale of approximately $1.1 billion, which was reported through other income. Excluding the Pets Best gain on sale, net revenue increased $530 million or 17%. Net interest income increased 9% to $4.4 billion, driven by 50% higher interest and fees. This growth in interest and fees reflected the combined impacts of higher loan receivables, a lower payment rate and higher benchmark rates and was partially offset by higher interest expense from benchmark rates. RSAs of $764 million in the quarter were 3.04% of average loan receivables, a reduction of $153 million versus the prior year, driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.  Provision for credit losses increased to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $299 million reserve builds, which included a $190 million build related to the acquisition of Ally Lending. Other expenses grew 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs in support of growth and our continued investment in technology. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter excluding the impact of the gain on sale was 32.3%, an improvement of approximately 270 basis points versus last year. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.74% compared to 3.81% in the prior year and 18 basis points above our average for the first quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.42% versus 1.87% last year and 14 basis points above our average for the first quarters of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge-off rate was 6.31% in the first quarter compared to 4.49% in the prior year, an average of 5.84% in the first quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.72%, up 46 basis points from the 10.26% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of seasonal trends. The reserve build in the quarter largely reflected the addition of the Ally Lending portfolio. As Brian discussed, Synchrony's credit performance has been consistent with our expectations. Given that Synchrony shares the consumer with our broader industry peers, we continue to monitor our portfolio and the broader industry's credit performance as we've done periodically since mid-2023, we've been taking incremental credit actions starting in March. Across specific segments of our portfolio that should reinforce our portfolio's performance for 2024 and beyond. As Slide 4 demonstrates, Synchrony has built a track record of achieving consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions. This performance has been enabled by the combination of our disciplined underwriting, which targets a 5.5% to 6% loss rate on average and RSA, which aligns program and portfolio performance. We will continue to leverage our deep consumer lending experience, our diversified product suite, sales platforms and verticals and our sophisticated data analytics and technology to further deliver on that priority.  Turning to Slide 12. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. Our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with our consumers as we grew deposits $2.4 billion in the first quarter. Deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end, and are complemented by our securitized debt and unsecured funding strategies, which each represent 8% of our total funding. During the quarter, we issued $750 million of secured funding and completed a preferred stock issuance of $500 million which served to more fully optimize our capital structure. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $24.9 billion, up $3.2 billion from last year and at quarter end represented 20.5% of total assets, up 38 basis points from last year.  Moving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will continue to make its annual transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points each January through 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the first quarter with CET1 ratio of 12.6%, 40 basis points lower than last year's 13.0%. The net capital impact of our Pets Best sale and Ally Lending acquisition added approximately 40 basis points to our CET1 ratio. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8%, unchanged compared to last year. Our total capital ratio decreased 10 basis points to 15.8%, and our Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 23.8% compared to 23% last year. During the first quarter, we returned $402 million to shareholders, consisting of $300 million of share repurchases and $102 million of common stock dividends. As of March 31, 2024, we had $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. As part of our capital planning approved by the Board of Directors, our share repurchase authorization was increased by $1 billion, bringing our total authorization to $1.3 billion for the period ending June 30, 2025. Furthermore, the Board intends to maintain our current quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. Turning on Slide 13 for a review of our 2024 business trends. As a reminder, Synchrony previously filed an 8-K on March 5, 2024, with a revised financial outlook, including EPS guidance for the full year 2024, specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rule change and our product, policy and pricing changes, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of the late fee related litigation that was filed in March, the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule changes and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the product, policy and pricing changes we implement as a result of the new rule.  Outcomes and actual performance related to any of these uncertainties could impact the EPS outlook. Looking at the remainder of the year. Synchrony will continue to execute across our key strategic priorities and prepare our business as we navigate an evolving operating environment. We have commenced the implementation of our product, policy and pricing changes the majority of which will be completed over the next 2 to 3 months, and we anticipate having greater clarity on the impacts of these changes likely in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we continue to expect our business to demonstrate typical season patterns in many of our key metrics. We expect net charge-offs to peak in the first half of the year and that the reserve coverage at year-end should be lower than the year-end 2023 rate.  Finally, we expect that the RSA will continue to align program performance and continue to function as designed. In closing, Synchrony is focused on leveraging our core strengths to optimize our business position and build our long history of delivering steady, growth and strong risk-adjusted returns. Our depth of consumer lending experience informs our go-to-market and product strategies. Our investment in sophisticated credit management tools empower our agility and our RSA supports our financial resilience. Together, our differentiated model continues to consistently deliver value to each of our stakeholders through changing environments. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony's first quarter results were driven by our differentiated business model and our commitment to delivering sustainable, strong results for our customers, partners and stakeholders. We are leveraging our proprietary industry and consumer insights, our diversified products and platforms and our advanced data analytics to consistently provide access to responsible financing solutions for our customers, sales and loyalty for our partners and sustainable growth as strong risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders. We're confident that Synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we navigate the year ahead.  We're excited about the opportunities we see to drive still greater long-term value as we continue to partner with hundreds of thousands of small and midsized businesses and health providers to provide access to credit to our more than 70 million customers for their everyday needs and wants. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So it seems like charge-offs are coming in a little bit higher than expected, but we've now seen delinquencies potentially inflect and starting to follow seasonal patterns. So can you maybe talk about what this means for the full year loss rate? And where do you see losses in the allowance settling out over the intermediate time frame if your forward view proves accurate? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. So again, I think we have been somewhat clear that we believe charge-offs when you look at the delinquency trend as we entered into 2024 that charge-offs will peak in the first half of the year and decline. I think you see that, well, certainly in the end in the first quarter. I think when you see the results in April when we put out our 8-K, you will see delinquencies down on both a 30-plus and 90-plus basis relative to what we just reported here today. So I think when you start looking at that, you look at the seasoning of the credit actions that we took really in the second and third quarter of last year. We feel good that the charge-off rate will decline in the back half of the year.  And most certainly, we haven't changed our underwriting targets to be in the 5.5% to 6% range, generally speaking. So we feel good about that, which leads us to the belief that if you see that lower net charge-off rate in the back half of the year and you project that forward into 2025 that the reserve coverage rate should be below the 10.26% rate that we had really at the end of last year and really the increase in the first quarter here was reflective more of the seasonal patterns than anything else. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up. So the RSA has beaten several quarters in a row. 1Q was well below that 3.50% to 3.75%, I think you had outlined in the prior guidance. So maybe just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the RSA for '24. This is, of course, ex late fees. And do you think the new normal for this is below that 4% to 4.25%, 4.5% you've outlined in the past? Brian Wenzel : Yes, Ryan, as I look the RSA trend, the first quarter was it that clearly, when you look at year-over-year on the higher net charge-offs, which was a substantial amount of the decrease in the RSA partially offset -- about 1/3 of it offset by really NII growth. And the NII was a little bit suppressed because you had the last full impact on your interest-bearing liabilities. If I take a step back for a second and think about the core business, Ryan, I believe we're at a point where we have peaked on assuming no rate increases and peaked on our interest-bearing liability costs as I talked about the net charge-off rate peaking in the first half, you should see an upward bias than in the RSA as we step through the remaining quarters of the year, the other variable will be volume. So even if you looked on a linked quarter basis, volume being down and being down a little bit year-over-year for some of the RSA clients will play a factor, but it should trend upwards as we step through, given the peaking nature of the interest-bearing liability costs and charge-offs. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess my first question is on purchase volume. Obviously, that continues to remain weak. Could we just talk about sort of how we get it back to a baseline that accelerates? I know inflation is sort of weighing in on the consumer. But maybe just talk about what's driving that and how and when we get it back to a baseline that's higher. Brian Doubles : Yes, Sanjay, maybe I'll start on this and then pass it to Brian. I mean, look, I think generally, we're pretty pleased with the growth that we're seeing in the business. I think the consumer is still in good shape. Obviously, the job market is very strong, that's helping. But you are seeing a lot of that spend being driven by the higher end consumer -- the higher income consumer. And that's actually not a bad thing. I think they're benefiting obviously job market, house prices are up, stock prices are up. On the lower end, that's where you're seeing some of the slowdown. And from a credit perspective, that's not the worst thing. I think we see people being prudent. I think they're managing to a budget, they're managing to their cash flows. They're not overextending. So I think there's a positive read-through from a credit perspective on that. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything. Brian Wenzel : The first thing, Sanjay, I want to remind people, we're comping off of what I'd say is a really strong quarter last year. So when you look at a 2% up, that is very strong. It's a record for our company for the first quarter. Brian highlighted some of the differences, I think you're plus 8% on the higher [freight cost], down a little bit year-over-year in lower [freight cost]. We are seeing most certainly the consumer step back in certain bigger ticket areas, right, either going down in transaction values, which I think you see reflected in the home and auto purchase line being down and really in lifestyle. But what you see strengths in those pockets. Our home specialty business is up in double digits or our outdoors business is up. So it's selected. The consumer is just being more prudent with the dollars. Again, we see transaction frequency up even though transaction values are down. So the consumer, I'd say, is managing through this period. So I wouldn't necessarily read too much into it that there's a big change in the consumer profile and what they're doing. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Very helpful. And I couldn't let you guys get away without a late fee question. So maybe just as we're waiting here on the courts at this point. Maybe you can just talk about how you're planning for a mid-May implementation and how much flexibility you have if there's an injunction after the current planned implementation period? And any early observations on the PPPC behavior changes? I know most of that will be in the second half. Brian Doubles : Yes, Sanjay. So we're not surprised this was the second question, we thought it might be the first. Obviously, we are waiting on the outcome of litigation that is uncertain but we're executing our plan. We said from the beginning that we weren't going to wait for the outcome on litigation, just given the uncertainty. So we began the implementation of our changes in December. We're already over 60% done with those. We've got to send out the changes in terms, et cetera. The vast majority of those will be done in the next 2 months. So look, we're executing the plan. In terms of timing, our base case was October 1 that assumed an injunction. With that said, it will be extremely operationally challenging to get this implemented in May, but we're preparing for that as well as a scenario. Operator : We'll take our next question from Terry Ma with Barclays. Terry Ma : I just wanted to follow up on the product policy and pricing changes. Is there any way we should think about how those benefits sort of materialize once it's kind of fully phased in? Is there a way to think about whether or not it's a slower ramp through the year, a step up or kind of like a quicker ramp? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Terry. I'll take this and see if Brian has a follow-on. I think what you should expect to see is beginning an impact in a little bit in the second quarter, more in the third quarter with regard to the mitigants and then it continues to build from there. I've gotten the question in the past, and we really hadn't talked very much about it. When you think about how the APR phases in for the consumer. So when the APR becomes effective, which again, think about that as 60 days after notice, you'll begin to feel the effects of that, I'd say 50% in the first 12 months if you roll that out, 75% in 24 months. So you begin to fill that out. Now some of the other fees that come in and some of the other policy changes, they are more immediate when it comes in through there.  Now we'll certainly will see, as that flows through, there will be some adoption really relating to going with the e-statements and things like that, but it flow through different parts of the P&L that we expect. So again, I think you begin to see a ramp with some of the things that are more immediate and it gives you a sense on how the APR comes in. But that's why there was a blend in order to kind of get to that neutrality point a little bit sooner than just relying upon APRs. Terry Ma : Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I just had a question on your cash balances. It looked quite elevated this quarter relative to last year. Any color you can provide there on how we should think about that going forward? Brian Wenzel : Terry, to be honest with you, we have excess liquidity this quarter. I go back and attribute that really to the strength of our deposit franchise. I think when you just look at the core retail deposits were up $3.4 billion from the end of last year. And then you put the seasonal nature of the cash that kind of comes in, it served us well as we purchased Ally for $2 billion, but we also got $600 million coming in from the sale of the Pets Best franchise. So I'd say liquidity is kind of peaking. So I think if you think about margin and the effects on margins, you step through, net interest margin is probably at its low point for the year in the first quarter, given all that excess liquidity.  And listen, I think we've heard other lenders over the last week or two talk about balances being down, flatter balance sheets. That's not what we're expecting. So clearly, we're still in deposit gathering mode. We haven't really done anything to significantly track new deposits. It's just the strength and attractiveness of our digital franchise. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : I guess just a little bit more on the net interest margin, Brian, I know there's always a seasonal impact in Q1 as you gather deposits to kind of prefund for growth later in the year. And then you mentioned the PetSmart kind of causing incremental cash balances. But maybe could you give us some sense for like the -- parse out the -- what drove the margin decline this quarter relative to, say, 1Q '23? And then maybe talk about marginal deposit pricing and where you're kind of in the CD markets and the savings account markets and when deposit costs should level out. Brian Wenzel : Great, great. Thanks for the question, John. So when I think about year-over-year net interest margin, right, it's down 67 basis points. The biggest driver of that if I do net funding costs, so think about your interest-bearing liability costs offset by your income coming off the investment portfolio, that's about 88 points of decline that came off of that. There's another 19 basis points decline of having a higher -- at a higher liquidity portfolio year-over-year. That's been offset by the interest of fee yield, which is plus 40. Again, as we think about how that develops for the year, the asset -- the ALR kind of mix will neutralize back out. We believe we peaked on interest-bearing liability costs from here.  So in theory, as you step through, net interest margin should really improve as you move throughout the year. To your second question around pricing, really, when you think about the various tenors. If you looked at our 12-month CD rate, we're down 50 basis points from the end of the year 4Q '23 down to [ 48 days ]. We followed our people down which is generally flat to the second quarter of 2023. All issuers or all digital banks do have promo rates. So we have one promo rate still over 5%, which is our, I believe, are 15-month and that's really to manage at the end of the day, our retention on CDs and be competitive with other people, which have kind of off tenor.  I would expect, as we see people who are trying to manage their balancing, their liquidity down, we'll follow the market down here. We generally lag the brick-and-mortar banks, but we will follow the digital banks down as we move throughout the year. The final piece I'd say, John, is we still have 3 rate cuts in, but we didn't really have them coming into September, so there's no real impact unless something was more significant and moved sooner in the year from the Fed. John Hecht : Okay. And then maybe this is a little sticky of a question, but if -- and I know you've pulled EPS guidance, but ex rate fees with the -- your original $5.75 to $6 EPS still hold? Or are there other changes that we should consider reflective of kind of just the trend changes that we want to consider in terms of modeling? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So just to be clear, John, we put out the 8-K on March 5 that had the EPS guidance, we have not pulled that guidance. We just didn't reiterate it because it's only 45 days ago, so we did put it on the page this morning. If I think about that core business, what I'd say, Brian and I would probably tell you is that we're ahead of what we thought we're going to be. I think interest-bearing liability costs are up or were better than our expectations. Charge-offs generally in line with our expectations. And then when you start to think about some of the things I've highlighted about. Number one, your interest-bearing liabilities cost peaking; number two, charge-offs peaking in the second half. And I mentioned on this call that you're going to see a sequential decline in delinquencies. That's in line. I think when you then think about the reserve rate being lower than [ 10.26% ], I think that sets up and is consistent with the guidance we provided out in March 5. But again, it's only 45 days or so ago. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Jeffrey Adelson : Just on the credit outlook, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the mid-'24 versus first half '24. Just given the nice delinquency formation improvement you've been seeing and your second quarter tends to be the seasonally best for NCO. Just wanted to help understand what mid-2024 looks like here. Is that more of a seasonally adjusted peak year-over-year growth peak? Or -- and maybe just help us understand what you're thinking about there. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Maybe I'll try to simplify this, Jeff, but thanks for the question. Everything is seasonally adjusted. So we built our plan. It has a seasonal overlays, which have been muted for last couple of years, given the normalization to happen as we move back to the pre-pandemic levels of delinquency. I would think about it in this way in just free and fairly simple. First half losses will be higher than second half losses and I think if you just kind of rolled most certainly our 30-plus and 90-plus out, you can kind of see how that will play through if you believe that you're going to get a band here in April, further than in dollars. You can see how it flows out. So I just think about it in half to simplify versus trying to get to an exact date when it peaks. Jeffrey Adelson : Got it. And again, on the late fee I think you mentioned how difficult it would be to implement operationally in May. Could you just talk about what that specifically might look like for you? And how we maybe can think about the $0.15 to $0.25 impact you made out previously, if that does happen? And kind of as part of the question as well, I know you mentioned 60% of the changes are out. Can you just talk a little bit about the consumer behavior, response rate in terms of how they're reacting to those changes so far? Brian Doubles : Yes, I'll take the first part of that. So operationally, it's very challenging from a number of different angles. And obviously, it's for the issuer, but also the vendors that the issuers rely on. I think it's important to note, too, that this is across the industry. It's not specific to us. Everybody has got the same challenges. If any event we do have to implement this on May 14. I think we were prepared to make the systematic changes and things like that. The real challenges come around terms changes and updating collateral and things like that. So that's where a lot of the operational complexity sits. And I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So to try to provide a dimension, really more a framework for how you think about it, Jeff. Our base case assumption as we walked in was in October implementation day, we thought that's going to be the case. There are a lot of scenarios between here and when the courts will take action on the pending litigation and the injunction. So it's difficult to speculate on any particular scenario because it's just so uncertain. I think everyone would have thought something different, at least everyone on this call would have had a different opinion. That being said, if you want to think about a framework for 1 second. Number one, I'd say this doesn't impact where you exit out of 2025 from projective whether it's October or earlier than October, that exit point is exactly the same, number one. Number two, it doesn't really impact the stability of our business and what we're doing from our PPPC changes. As Brian talked about how much we've rolled out. So that -- those 2 things fundamentally don't change. That being said, if you think about May implementation date, there's a much larger impact in 2024 on EPS. But then as you think about 2025, that EPS generally then would be higher than either the October scenario or significantly higher on an actual '24 to '25 basis as you look at it.  So once we have greater clarity with regard to when the actual implementation date happens or occurs or will occur. We'll then -- when it provide incremental transparency relative to the financial implications, both on '24 and try to dimensionalize '25 for people as well. But I think it's important to understand those frameworks about how we exit '25 and then any incremental detriment in '24 in theory gets a benefit in '25. Brian Doubles : And then just on your last question on consumer behavior and impact. I'd say we haven't seen anything yet that's different than our expectations. I'd say it's largely in line. But the only caution I would have is it's very early. There's a bleed in period for a lot of these terms changes. But so far, what we're seeing from the consumer side is generally in line with what we expected. Operator : We will take our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : So just a follow up on the response to the last question on the PPPC impact. So if I hear you right, the March 5, 8-K, the guidance that -- or the estimates that you gave there of the offsets ranging from $650 million to $700 million pretax, which does imply a pretty significant ramp given the time horizon today into the fourth quarter. We should assume -- those are still good benchmarks to use and -- because it obviously does imply a pretty significant ramp in the back end of the year in terms of NII. That's the other late fee impact. So I just want to make sure that those numbers are still applicable or am I missing something there? Brian Wenzel : Well, let me just start with that's based off on October implementation date. And the way to think about it is you begin to have some of the PPPC changes happen in the second and third quarters, partially offset by RSA, then you come into the fourth quarter, you would have the detriment from the late fee going away, but a higher RSA offset in that quarter. Obviously, that all shifts if you went to an earlier implementation date. So that range would change materially in a situation where you had a potential implementation day prior to October. Again, I think if that does happen, we'll come back and provide greater clarity on the impact on the late fees as well as impact on the changes that we're doing. Saul Martinez : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just a broader -- I guess a broader question. You do -- you did in your presentation reiterate the long-term target, 2.5-plus percent ROA, 28-plus percent [ RPC ]. I get the offsets and you guys are working to fully offset that. But it is a pretty significant -- if it gets implemented, it is a pretty significant reduction or the source of revenue that effectively goes away and we'll see what happens with Basel III, but at least maybe it's not going to be an impact. But the direction of travel at least on capital is moving higher. I'm just curious like how you're thinking about the long-term targets for profitability going forward, your degree of confidence in how you -- where you think those are still applicable targets? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Obviously, we look at it and Brian and I have been very clear that the organization -- our goal is to be ROA neutral at the end of the impact of the late fee rule change. And we -- again, when we get better clarity with regard to the actual implementation date, we could talk a little bit about that timing. So the goal is to get back to ROA neutral. And that's the plan that we are rolling out and beginning to execute today. Understand there are a lot of assumptions with regard to consumer behavior that are in there and other things that can impact it. That being said, if you think about a more normalized environment, right? So I think 5.5% interest rates are not normalized. When you think about an inflation rate that's [ evolving ] when they normalize, you should be able to come back to that ROA profile that's -- and that's one of the strengths of the RSA itself that kind of helps us get back to that. From a capital standpoint, I can't really forecast and I'm not sure other people can, where exactly the Fed may or may not go with regard to Basel III. I mean most certainly, there has not been a lot of support around that. So we'll see what those changes are. That being said, we actually have excess capital, and we're going to continue to move down towards our target, which helps us get to the ROTCE. So again, the focus on being ROA neutral through the late fee rule change, number one, deploying our excess capital, whether that being to our RWA, that's accretive to earnings and ROA or when we turn it back to shareholders. Our goal is to get back to those medium to long-term targets we put out a couple of years ago. Operator : We will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Your capital position is still pretty strong. I was just curious if you thought the CFPB changes could lead to some portfolio movements over the next year or two? And do you see any more opportunistic deals like Ally? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, we're always on the lookout for potential acquisitions or new programs, Ally fit our business model perfectly. It's exactly the type of acquisition that we look for. It's in industries that we know really well. We understand the products, a great cultural fit, like it just -- it checked all the boxes. So we do -- we have excess capital today. We generate a lot of capital over the calendar year. And if we have the opportunity to do something opportunistic, we certainly have the financial resources to do it. Brian Wenzel : Yes. The only thing I'd add on to that, just to dimensionalize it for you, if you look at Page 12 of our earnings deck, we showed that the earnings power of this business does generate that capital, you look year-over-year, last 12 months, we generated 2.5% CET1 just from the net earnings of the business. So really positive effects that you can look at and lean into plus you have the excess capital that weigh between there and our target level of the CET1. Brian Doubles : Yes. The only other point I'd make on this is we are very disciplined when it comes to accretive acquisitions that have a really good strategic fit. I mean, I think you've seen that discipline over the years. We haven't done really large-scale M&A. We've been very thoughtful about finding things that are relatively modest from a capital outlay perspective, but our businesses that we can grow really well. That's a great example of that, a perfect example of that, a leg row I think Ally is going to be a home run for us. So we are very disciplined in terms of what we look for. Operator : We'll take the next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Two questions this morning. First, on the CFPB, one of the consequences that the industry has raised in terms of the rule changes, the loss of deterrents, would suggest that DQs will be higher. I'm curious if you guys have had discussions with your accountants related to how you will treat reserve policies if you have higher delinquencies but potentially assume lower pull-throughs? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Rick, thanks for the question. Well, certainly, we've had internal conversations about the effects of deterrents and it's really going to be how we model the -- any potential change in delinquency. And again, what you're looking at here are individuals who are making a choice not to pay, those who lost their job or had a health event, and roll in delinquency, you're not going to rehabilitate that this wasn't a deterrent for them. They're going to roll to loss or roll the settlement, et cetera. This is people who made an active decision to -- they prioritize one payment over another payment. We would have to model that out and then we'll certainly get our accounts comfortable with how it is. But again, we'll have to see because no one really did a lot of testing control at this level of deterrence. Most certainly, there's things done back in the CARD Act that demonstrated deterrence, but we'll have to see how it plays out, Rick. Richard Shane : Got it. And then in terms of the concept of charge-off peak in the middle of the year, seasonality works in your favor really steadily over the next 6 months and then starts to reverse in the fourth quarter. When you're talking about a peak, are you suggesting that as we move into the fourth quarter, charge-offs will continue to decline or that they will normally seasonally rebound but perhaps not quite as much as they have in the past. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question again, Rick. We haven't given quarterly guidance. Again, I'm just going to give you the framework. We applied seasonal patterns to how the loss rate works again. We believe we're more normalized and back to the prepandemic levels. And I think as you begin to see, you will see, again, in April, dollar declines in 30-plus and 90-plus, which have a flow-through effect both on the third quarter and the fourth quarter as they kind of come through. So we're not going to get into specific quarter guidance now. But again, the rates in the first half of the year will be higher than the rates in the second half of the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : I was wondering if you could just speak to your annual internal stress testing process. And it's a little screwy, I guess, in this 2-year window because you've got the late fee folding in, but then you would arguably hit the business with peak losses. Does that become a constraint at all for capital considerations? Or do you feel like you have enough excess capital and enough line of sight to this ROA neutrality that you can kind of look through that maybe a temporarily elevated stress test result? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Brian. So first, let me just be clear. We have submitted our capital plan to the Fed. We're part of the horizontals, we're part of the CCAR group, albeit we do not get a stress capital buffer until 2026. So the process remains somewhat the same as in prior years other than will engage a little bit differently with the Fed than we have in the past. But again, the stress capital buffer comes in 2026. When you specifically look at the capital plan that our Board just approved and management presented to them, there were scenarios or scenario in there around late fees and the impact of late fees that put it there.  That doesn't -- that informed our overall capital decision, but doesn't necessarily restrict the plans that we had. Even if I came back and said I had an earlier implementation date, which we talked a little bit on this call, that would not necessarily interfere with our capital targets and our plans. Again, all that's subject to the normal things we'd say is the market conditions and everything else, Brian. But the impact of the late fee rule doesn't necessarily impact the capital plan that we announced this morning. Brian Foran : That's very helpful. And maybe if I could sneak in on competition. Are you generally seeing competitors in the market respond in common ways on these kind of PPPC efforts? Is there any evidence of any point to big divergence or people breaking from the pack? Or is kind of everyone doing different combinations of similar things? Brian Doubles : We only see what's out there in terms of public changes in terms. But I would tell you, my expectation is that everybody is going to do a combination of the same things that we're doing. It's a pretty -- it's a relatively standard playbook. You might see some issuers do a couple of things differently. But I think on the whole, it's going to be the APR increases, different types of fees, et cetera, to offset this. And it's important that we do. Our goal from the beginning has been to protect our partners and continue to provide credit to the customers that we do today. And unfortunately, that's impossible to do without these offsets. Brian Wenzel : The only thing I'd add, Brian, I do think the one thing you will see, we probably have been a little bit more -- or surprise showed a little bit more sense of urgency and gotten out ahead of this based upon discussions with our partners. So that may pay a little bit, but I think Brian is right over the medium term here. That's where you're going to see the convergence. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good morning. Some of your -- on that very last point, they just brought up some of the peer card vendors that have somewhat smaller private label and Co-Brand card businesses that have begun to indicate maybe a willingness to absorb the late fee -- the foregone late fees as a result of the rule change. Can you talk about if we do see that happen at some players where late fees are a smaller piece of their overall revenue, but they're in the private label in Co-Brand business, do you view that as a competitive threat if they do absorb the impact? Brian Doubles : I don't see it as a competitive threat today. I think in our space, in the vast majority of our business, I think you're going to see issuers do the same types of things that we're doing. I think it's going to be really important in terms of the economic sharing with the partners. I think we're obviously focused on providing credit to the customers that we do today. And fortunately, you need to do some of these things in order to protect that and protect our partners.  So I do think you'll start to see -- and we're starting to see this now. You'll start to see some issuers. We're building this into pricing models as we look at new business. We're starting to build it as we bring on portfolios from our competitors you've got to contemplate an $8 late fee. You have to assume that while we're hoping for a better outcome on the litigation, obviously, you got to build in scenarios where we have a much lower late fee. So I think it will even out over time across the industry, primarily in the space that we operate in today. Brian Wenzel : The one thing, John, you just took it up a level for a second. So if you had a theoretical case where someone who has a smaller business than ours decides to absorb some of that late fee, what you end up into is a suboptimal return profile. And inside a large institution-wide may be immaterial. The question would be, does it attract capital? And how long can you sustain that? And we've seen over history, businesses come out of flavor in certain larger institutions where this is a small part. This is what we do in the same way that we look inside our businesses, our platforms and allocate capital to some of our better performing, higher returning portions of the portfolio. That, I think, over time will have to happen to these institutions. So I'm not sure that that's a long-term viable strategy if someone wants to do that. But again, it's very theoretical your question. John Pancari : Got it. No, that makes sense. And then separately, back to the EPS, sorry to deliver that, but the -- I know you're not reiterating that $5.70 to $6     guide. And I just want to understand, it's just because it was only 45 days ago, and the underlying components that you had baked in at that point in March have not changed materially enough to change how you're thinking about your underlying trends? I know we've had moves in rates, had some development on the late fee dynamics. But I just want to make sure that the core expectations that were part of that $5.7 to $6 have not changed at all. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Again, I'm going to just say it again, we put that guidance up 45 days ago. I didn't feel a need to -- or nor I think Brian feel the need to put it back on this page or two kind of update again, what I've said is the quarter and the points I raised about net interest margin, losses, reserves, positive on expenses, I think should be viewed favorably relative to that kind of base -- based BAU performance of the business. So we're very pleased on how we're exiting out of the first quarter and moving in on a core BAU basis. Operator : And we are almost at our allotted time. We will take one final question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Just wanted to -- two big picture questions. Maybe to start first just on the competitive situation. And really more -- not so much necessarily on the new programs, but just in terms of the financing offers that are already out there for consumers. How is the purchase volume being impacted at all by consumers just having more choices today? Like are there any market share or penetration rate statistically been shared in terms of how often consumers are turning to Synchrony versus others? As a percent of your retail partner sales or anything like that? I'm sure you track it. Brian Doubles : Yes, we do. We track it by partner. We look at the penetration rate, sales on our card versus other products. I'll tell you, generally, we're very pleased that inside of the majority of our partner programs that we're gaining share. I think one of the things that helps us do that as we think about a multiproduct strategy, we see our partners engaging more on being able to offer a revolving product, maybe a secured card, buy now pay later. And I think that's helping us gain share. If you stick to a one product strategy, I think over time, that's a losing strategy and I think you will lose share, which is why we think the multiproduct strategy over time is a winning one. So we feel really good about our ability to continue to take share inside of our partner programs, but also just more generally and even some of the smaller to midsized space. Mihir Bhatia : And then, Brian, just last question. In terms of your -- in the prepared remarks, I think in the press release today, you highlighted the partnership with small- and medium-sized businesses as well as health providers. I think the emphasis -- there is a little bit of a new emphasis on the small- and medium-sized businesses relative to the old one. So I was just curious, is the growth focus that Synchrony switching a little bit to smaller or maybe the more proprietary programs versus maybe a historical focus on just being the partner of choice for large retailers? Brian Doubles : Well, I definitely think that's an underappreciated part of our business model. I think people tend to focus on the large partner programs, but we do -- we serve hundreds of thousands of providers and small- to medium-sized businesses. And sometimes that gets lost a little bit. So we're definitely leaning in more there. I'd say the -- we've shifted investment dollars into the health and wellness space, you see that paying off when you look at the health and wellness numbers, I think receivables were up 20%, like we're really reaping the benefits of those investments. So that's a very attractive space for us. The large partner space is still very attractive as well, but I think that part of the business always gets a lot of attention. We're trying to make sure that we talk enough about all the small- to medium-sized businesses and the hundreds of thousands of dentists and pet care specialists across the country that we serve. Operator : And this concludes Synchrony earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you.",

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning everyone. Today Synchrony reported strong second quarter results, including net earnings of $643 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 20.2%. This performance is a testament to our differentiated business model. We continue to leverage our diversified portfolio of products and sales platforms, disciplined approach to credit underwriting and management, and innovative digital capabilities to further progress on our strategic objectives and to deliver sustainable, risk-adjusted growth and returns over the long term. Customer demand for Synchrony's product and value propositions remained strong during the second quarter as Synchrony added 5.1 million new accounts, grew average active accounts by 2%, generated $47 billion of purchase volume and delivered ending receivables growth of 8% compared to last year. Synchrony's proprietary data and analytics, in combination with our flexible financing solutions and dynamic technology platform, have been core drivers of our performance through evolving market conditions, particularly as we seek to responsibly address the needs of our customers and partners. And while our credit trends relative to pre-pandemic levels have outperformed most of the industry today, we have leveraged these strengths to take action in our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of default. These credit actions, along with a more selectively spending consumer, have contributed to lower new account and purchase volume growth in the second quarter, but have also improved our recent delinquency trends and should strengthen our portfolio's credit trajectory in 2024 and beyond. At the platform level, purchase volume and receivables trends were generally consistent in the second quarter. Purchase volume growth ranged from up 2% to down 3% year-over-year, broadly reflecting lower consumer spend on bigger ticket items, particularly in categories like furniture, jewelry and vision, as well as the impact of the credit actions. Meanwhile, receivables growth across the platforms ranged from 6% to 15% higher versus last year, driven primarily by payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 2%. Synchrony's out-of-partner spend gives us deeper insight into recent customer trends as the broad utility of our offerings and compelling value propositions attract purchases across a range of categories, industries and products. Our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases, particularly in larger ticket categories such as home furnishings, travel and entertainment. They have been spending more at restaurants, though, and continue to spend at the pharmacy and on health and wellness needs and contributing to non-discretionary spend growth more broadly. That said, our customers are spending slightly less per transaction across most categories and credit grades, as average transaction values declined about 2% versus last year. Only our top credit segment saw growth in average ticket values during the second quarter. Customers across credit grades are transacting more frequently, however, which has generally offset most of the impact of lower transaction values. Altogether, we view these spend behaviors as appropriate and consistent with the payment rate normalization that began in our portfolio in 2023 and has continued since. Over the first six months of 2024, however, the pace of this payment rate moderation has decelerated across credit grades. And according to the external deposit data we monitor, there continues to be relative stability in savings balances compared to the rapid tapering that occurred through the middle of last year. When taken together, we believe these spend, payment and savings trends support our view that consumers are making healthy decisions to actively manage their cash flows. And these trends, coupled with the impact of our credit actions, give us confidence that Synchrony's net charge-off rate should be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half. As we continue to monitor the health of the consumer, our portfolio credit performance and that of the broader industry, Synchrony is also utilizing our proprietary insights and lending expertise to position our business for sustainable, risk-adjusted growth for many years to come. During the second quarter, we added or renewed more than 15 partners, including a program expansion and extension with Verizon and the addition of Virgin Red. We are excited about our continued partnership with Verizon and the opportunity we see to deliver maximum customer value on purchases made at Verizon. We are also proud to be the exclusive issuer of Virgin Red's multi-category travel card, the first ever Virgin Red Rewards World Elite Mastercard, which will connect members across the Virgin family from flights to cruises, hotels and experiences with points that never expire. Cardholders will earn Virgin points on all of their Virgin Red Rewards card spend, which can be used for a range of gifts and rewards, all while enjoying a first-rate digital experience from application to servicing. And as Synchrony continues to extend our reach and further optimize outcomes for both our customers and partners, we are incorporating strategic and technology-oriented partnerships to power more seamless digital experiences. Synchrony selectively works with second-look financing solutions to enhance the customer experience and our partner relationships. We recently announced an expanded relationship that will utilize a fully integrated solution spanning the full customer, apply and buy experience across all points of sale. Synchrony will own the point-of-sale platform and connect to the second source provider in a way that's seamless to both the partner and the customer that's applying. This collaboration will utilize our innovative technology and data to responsibly expand access to credit to more consumers, while also driving stronger loyalty and sales for the many small businesses, healthcare providers and retail partners we serve. Meanwhile, Synchrony launched our partnership with Installation Made Easy, a leading enterprise software and services company that supports retail-based home improvement programs. This partnership will enable Floor & Decor cardholders to use their Synchrony-issued credit card to finance both the materials and the installation service required for their home improvement projects through one streamlined process. We're excited about the opportunity we see to strengthen our position in the home improvement market and plan to scale this capability to additional retailers over time. So whether it's through the continued expansion of our distribution networks, the addition and renewal of programs that span most consumer spend categories, or the enhanced functionality at point of sale, Synchrony is leveraging our proprietary data and analytics, our diverse product suite, and our innovative technology to drive greater access, flexibility and utility for both our customers and partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. Synchrony's second quarter results continue to demonstrate the resilience of our differentiated business model through an evolving environment. While consumers are managing their cash flows and consumption and the impact of our credit actions are beginning the season, we remain focused on driving sustainable, risk-adjusted growth. Turning to our financial performance. Ending loan receivables grew 7.9% to $102 billion in the second quarter, benefiting from an approximately 80 basis point decrease in the payment rate and reflecting growth across each of our sales platforms. Net revenue increased 13% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher interest and fees, lower RSA and an increase in other income. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.4 billion as interest and fees grew 10%, primarily reflecting growth in average loan receivables. Our loan receivable yield grew 14 basis points, benefiting from product repricing actions and lower payment rate, partially offset by the higher reversals as our net charge-offs increased. RSAs of $810 million in the second quarter were 3.21% of average loan receivables, down $77 million versus the prior year, driven by higher net charge-offs partially offset by higher net interest income. And the increase in other income primarily reflected a $51 million gain related to the exchange of our Visa B-1 shares, as well as initial fee-related impact of our product, pricing and policy changes, or PPPCs. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of the Pets Best disposition. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.7 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $70 million reserve build. Other expenses grew 1% to $1.2 billion, which was driven by technology investments, preparatory expenses related to late fee rule change and servicing costs related to newly acquired businesses, partially offset by the operational losses and cost discipline resulting from lower employee and marketing costs. The preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule changes reflected $23 million of incremental costs related to both the execution of our PPPCs and the implementation of the rule itself, should it become effective. Even with these incremental costs, Synchrony's efficiency ratio was 31.7% for the second quarter, an improvement of approximately 380 basis points versus last year. In sum, Synchrony generated net earnings of $643 million, or $1.55 per diluted share. This produced a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 20.2%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 9. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47% versus 3.84% in the prior year and 19 basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.19% versus 1.77% last year and 18 basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge-off rate was 6.42% in the second quarter compared to 4.75% in the prior year and 62 basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.74%, up 2 basis points from 10.72% in the first quarter. The reserve build in the quarter primarily reflected loan receivable growth. As shown on Slide 10, the credit actions we've taken thus far are improving our delinquency trajectory as the rate of year-over-year growth continues to decelerate. We will continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance and the credit trends for the broader industry given our share consumer and we will take additional credit actions as necessary. While these actions are reducing new account and purchase volume growth in the short term, we expect they will strengthen our portfolio's positioning as we exit 2024 and support our ability to deliver our targeted risk-adjusted returns over the long term. Turning to Slide 11, Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity remain a source of strength. We grew our direct deposits in the quarter as consumers responded to our strong offerings while reducing our broker deposits. Deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end and a secured and unsecured debt, each representing 8% of total funding. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $23 billion, up $3.6 billion from last year, and represented 19.1% of total assets, up 124 basis points from last year. Moving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will make a final transitional adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under CECL transition rules, we end the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.6%, 20 basis points lower than last year's 12.8%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8%, 20 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 10 basis points to 15.8%, and our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 23.9% compared to 22.8% last year. During the second quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders consisting of $300 million of share repurchases and $100 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, we had $1 billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 30th, 2025. Synchrony remains well-positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. Combining those results, Synchrony delivered a second quarter performance largely within our expectations. We remain focused on taking appropriate actions to prepare our business for years to come, including our ability to deliver our long-term targeted loss rate between 5.5% and 6% and average return on assets of at least 2.5% on average over time. We've been closely monitoring our performance and taking prudent credit actions in support of these objectives. And in preparation for the pending new rule on late fees and our desire to offset the impact on our business as soon as possible, Synchrony has completed the first phase of our PPPCs. Most of these actions will begin to go into effect in the second half of 2024 and we'll continue to track their financial and operational impact on our customers, partners and portfolio to determine alongside our partners whether any refinements to our strategies are warranted to achieve our shared objective. As a reminder, specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rules and our PPPCs, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of late fee-related litigation that was filed in March, the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule changes and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the PPPCs we implement as a result of the new rule. Outcomes and actual performance related to these uncertainties could impact our outlook. With that framework, let's turn to the outlook for the second half of 2024. We expect the consumer to continue to manage their cash flows and consumption, which, when combined with our credit actions, should result in flat to low-single-digit decline in purchase volume. We continue to expect payment rates to moderate, which, when combined with our purchase volume expectations, should contribute to more moderate loan receivable growth in the second half. Excluding the impact of late fee rule implementation, we expect net interest income and other income to progressively grow in the third and fourth quarters as our PPPCs take effect. From a credit perspective, delinquencies should continue to trend in line with or better than seasonality. We expect our net charge-off rate to be lower in the second half of this year than the first half. Our reserve coverage ratio at the end of 2024 is expected to be generally in line with our year-end 2023 reserve rate. RSA will continue to align with program and company performance. And finally, we expect other expenses to trend in line with the first-half average on a dollar basis. When you combine these factors and include the impact of the late fee rule assuming an implementation date of October 1st, 2024, along with the various offsets from the implementation of our PPPCs and the $1.96 per share gain on the sale of our Pets Best business in 1Q '24, Synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per share between $7.60 and $7.80 for the full year. This consolidated and updated EPS range is in the upper end of our prior guidance and reflects Synchrony's dedication delivering optimized outcomes for our many stakeholders, including strong risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony continues to execute at a high level in an evolving environment. We are leveraging our scale, our data analytics and credit management tools, our advanced digital capabilities, and our deep lending expertise to remain nimble and responsive while powering still better experiences and greater value to the customers, partners, providers and small businesses we serve. We are consistently driving compelling results for our many stakeholders and that momentum is increasingly attracting new and deepening existing opportunities for continued risk-adjusted growth, further embedding Synchrony at the heart of American commerce. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to start with just the health of the consumer. It sounds like the consumer is coming in a little weaker than you had maybe anticipated between purchase volume being lower, reserve rate a little higher. First, I guess, is that a fair statement? And if so, can you just comment on what other changes that is driving? Is it signaling that you need to tighten underwriting? Are you continuing to tighten underwriting? Is that broad-based? Is it about tweaking around the edges? Just how are you thinking of the consumer heading into like back-to-school season here? And just trying to understand your view on the consumer - Brian Doubles : Yes. No, thanks for the question. I think, well, generally, I think in the aggregate the consumer is still in pretty good shape. I think the trends that we're seeing are pretty similar across the industry. Obviously labor market is strong. That's definitely helping. I think most of the indicators so far are largely in line with what we expected to see. With that said, as you kind of dig into the portfolio, there are clearly some differences as well, as you look at different customer cohorts. The more affluent higher-income segments are still spending. They're not really as impacted by inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, you are starting to see the lower-income consumer pull back a bit. They're rotating into non-discretionary categories. So it's clear that they're feeling the effects of inflation and they're managing to a budget. And so while you're seeing that impact, purchase volume of the debt, new accounts, we think that's actually a positive from a credit perspective. People are being disciplined. That's a good thing. We don't see people overextending. So they're managing their spend and their cash flows, which again, I think is a positive from a credit perspective. Mihir Bhatia : Maybe just staying on credit then. Just on the reserve rate guidance, it changed to be -- I think now you're saying year-end '24 in line with '23. I think earlier it was a little bit better than '23. That said, you did call out and we see the data, right, the delinquency rate is trending in line to better than seasonality. Were you expecting more improvement than you got? I'm just trying to understand the factors driving the higher guide on reserve rate and if that implies '25 net charge-offs will be similar to '24. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mihir. When we entered the year, I think everyone had a perspective with regard to how the economy is going to develop, how inflation potentially could bend and interest rates could move down, right? As Brian mentioned, the consumer is managing and the longer they stay in a period of higher costs, particularly those that are lower income to medium income, that poses different risks. I think as we sit here in the middle part of the year, we would have hoped for probably greater progression against the inflation target, even though we understood it was sticky and we'd hope for, even though we only had three rate increases or rate -- I'm sorry, rate decreases for the back half of the year, we're down to one. So I think things have shifted out a little bit. So I think we're just being a little bit more cautious with regard to how we think about the macro going forward until we see signs that inflation really is breaking through some of this stickiness and you see some help to those consumers. So I don't think it's a tremendously different posture. It's just a little bit more conservative in how you think about your quantitative reserves versus your qualitative reserves. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you for taking my question. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Mihir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. Please go ahead. Terry Ma : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So I guess based on the rollout of your PPPCs, is the $650 million to $700 million range still kind of the right range to think about for the second half? And then secondly, is there a way you can kind of quantify what that -- how that range changes if the late fee cap were to not be implemented this year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Terry. I'll start where you ended. As we sit here today, there continues to be activity in the Texas courts. And as Brian indicated and I indicated in our remarks, that is uncertain. So the best guess we have now is an October 1st implementation date. And until we get some more definitive view with regard to whether or not that rule becomes effective on that date or a different date, we don't really have an update with regard to the impact and its effect if it doesn't go into play. So again, when we have greater certainty with regard to that implementation date, we'll certainly come back. With regard to the impact of the PPPCs, we provided updated guidance today. Again, if you take the midpoint of the -- both the core as well as the late fee assuming October 1st implementation date and add the Pets Best, you're at the midpoint to high end of the range from an EPS, which should give you a perspective on how we feel about both the core business as well as the actions we're taking with regard to the potential change in late fees. Terry Ma : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the RSA, how should we think about that, how that would trend in the second half, as you were kind of that again start rolling in? Brian Wenzel : Yes. A framework to think about it, Terry, is to think about the pieces that are going to flow through here. Obviously, we indicated that the second-half loss rate will be lower than the first-half loss rate. So obviously that's a upward bias on the RSA percent. Most certainly, I think in the third quarter, you're going to see some of the PPPC actions roll through. That's going to create an upward bias in the RSA. And then that turns around in the fourth quarter is -- again, assuming an October 1st implementation date of late fees that comes into play. And then I think it's just going to track with NII growth, which will be a little bit beneficial with slightly lower purchase volume. So there'll be some puts and takes, some of which will create headwinds, some of which create tailwinds. Terry Ma : Yes. Got it. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Terry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries : Yes. Thanks. Look, I appreciate there's a lot of moving pieces on the NIM for the second half of the year just given the implementation of some of the PPPCs and then -- and the potential rolling of the late fee impact. But could you just, Brian, maybe just give us a sense of kind of what the moving pieces are and what kind of your expectations are for NIM in the back half of the year? Brian Wenzel : Sure. Thanks for the question, Mark. So here's a framework how I think about some of the moving pieces you got to take into consideration, right? Number one, as we talked about, net charge-offs being lower in the second half versus the first half, you'll get a benefit to the net interest margin, right, relative to lower reversals. So that's a positive to the net interest margin. I think when you look at the net funding costs, so the interest expense and the investment income, that's probably going to be flattish to the back half of the year. You will pick up and there'll be a benefit into the net interest margin relative to the mix between average loan receivables and average interest-earning assets. So that will be a positive to NIM. You will pick up and you should see it in the third quarter some of the PPPC actions that are yield-related. So again, some of the things that were strictly APR related, some of the practices related to how interest was assessed and a little bit related to some promotional fees that roll into place. And you should see, again, hopefully a little bit benefit on the interest and fee line. So, generally there should be a positive trend up from where we move here into the back half of the year. Mark DeVries : Okay. That's helpful. And are there any contemplated PPPC measures that you've yet to put in place and are waiting for either to see how the consumer behaves or for actual implementation of the changes to the late fee rules? Brian Wenzel : Yes. What our team has gone through, the first wave that we've executed against that are ones that we have fully vetted internally with ourselves and then with our partners. So they are fully executed. There are other things down the road that are probably a little bit longer tail and we're still continuing to evaluate some around product configuration and other types of products for different segments inside the portfolio. So that's not necessarily part of the initial solve, but that may be a reaction that we come back with over time but wasn't necessarily critical to us to try to achieve the goal of being ROA neutral with the same level of sales. Mark DeVries : Got it. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Mark. Have a good day. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Mark. Mark DeVries : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Just continuing on that idea of the pricing changes. I know it's early, but have there been kind of impact on the consumer side that you can kind of see or talk about positive or negative from the pricing changes that you've put in place? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you, Moshe, for the question. We have a detailed monitoring dashboard that's in place that looks at a lot of different measures. Moshe, it starts with purchase active rate, sales per account, as you can imagine, includes closure rates -- voluntary closure rates. It includes call volume, complaint volume, all sorts of different measures that we would look at relative to this. I think it's important to understand why -- the first wave is complete now. We only have the CITs that we mailed in December having a full quarter. When we look at that dashboard in its entirety, it's generally in line with our expectations. As we step into the third quarter, I think we're going to get a greater view with regard to consumers' adoption with regard to it. I think we've seen some positive things around e-bill adoption, et cetera. So we closely monitor it gets produced and distributed to a wide variety of people inside the organization as we closely look at that and share that with our partners. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks. And Brian, you talked a little bit about the delinquency and loss rates relative to the 2017 to 2019 averages. Given that you've kind of said and reaffirmed that they will continue to improve and be lower in the second half and possibly better than seasonals, I guess, how do you see that? Assuming employment levels are stable here, how would you see that kind of trending towards those averages? How close could they get? And what is it that would then kind of get you to the point where you could think about neutralizing or reversing some of those tightening efforts? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So I think it's important, Moshe, to take -- to really take a step back. First of all, we've lagged the industry with regard to normalization. I think when you look at the amount that we are above our '17 to '19 range, I think outside of maybe one or two issuers, we actually are performing pretty well, being our 30-plus is 19 basis points higher than historical average and our 90-plus being 18 basis points higher than our historical average. And then again, you're right. When you look at the second quarter on a 30-plus basis, we're a couple of basis points favorable to seasonality and 90-plus, I think we were from range of 1 basis point to 2 basis points less than, so, generally in line to slightly better than seasonality. So I think we look at that -- I think we're going to look at how the macro environment develops. And again, the consumer is managing today as we start to see relief kind of come to them, I think we'll reevaluate it. I would not have an expectation that we're going to adjust those refinements in the near term here until we get greater clarity on the environment. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Moshe. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hi, good morning, everyone. Brian Doubles : Hi, Ryan. Brian Wenzel : Morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Maybe sticking with the late fee topic. Given the range of things that have been added, APRs, paper statements, trailing interest and the like, obviously markets have become hopeful that the rule could get delayed or may roll in favor of the industry. And I'm just curious, in a scenario, in a positive outcome for the industry, when you think about the range of changes you've made, what changes do you foresee sticking versus others, that there's the potential you may pare back over time? Brian Wenzel : Yes. First of all, good morning, Ryan. The first thing I think we have to have certainty, right, relative to whether or not the late fee rule, if it is delayed or ultimately overturned by the courts, whether or not the CFPB would continue down the path of pursuing some type of limitation on late fees. So I think you have to have some level of certainty beyond that. I think as you think about the pricing change, first and foremost, we're going to look at consumer behavior and whether or not consumer behavior changes here and whether or not changes would be warranted. I think when you step beyond that, there's probably two buckets, Ryan. The first bucket is one that involves our partners and RSAs. And there we would go and share the data with our partners and have a discussion with regard to pricing and make some decisions with their input. And then bucket B is things that are inside our brand and control. So you think about our Synchrony Mastercard, our Home & Auto cards, things like that, that we would control, but obviously we do that. It's fair to say not everything would ever get rolled back. But to be honest with you, Ryan, we have not spent a lot of time as a team going through this scenario. Right now, we're really focused on implementing the PPPCs and following the developments in the court being prepared, I think, for the outcome that the late fee rule goes into effect. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then if you look at how new accounts have progressed, obviously they're down a decent amount year-over-year, which makes sense given the discussion regarding tighter underwriting. But as you look ahead, given the tightness that it doesn't sound like we're going to be rolled back right now, you also have some payment rate normalization. How do you think about the pace of loan growth over an intermediate time frame? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So first, let me just focus for a little bit on new accounts, the 14%. There's probably two big buckets there, Ryan. The first is, we are seeing, and Brian talked about this with discretionary spend and some of the things where the consumer is managing their spend levels. We are seeing lower foot traffic and lower retail traffic, both in a physical footprint as well as in a digital orientation. So the through-the-door population most certainly is limiting some of the opportunities to generate new accounts. And then obviously you've had a modest impact from credit actions with regard to doing that. That will impact growth more so in '25 than it does really in '24, right? So you think about an account build that probably takes about 12 months or so to kind of get to a average balance per account that's more mature. So I think you're going to feel a little bit of pressure here. I do think given our position with most of our partners, you would see probably something above GDP level and will continue to grow. Most certainly, when you look at the platforms, we're excited about the Health & Wellness growth we continue to experience, even though there's some pullback there in cosmetic and LASIK, for example. But that is a strength for us. We continue to have strength in some of the other platforms, like our Home Specialty business and Home & Auto. So, again, we're not going to necessarily give guidance, but I think there are some positive things inside of the sales platforms that will hopefully bridge us into a better economic period. Brian Doubles : I think the other thing I would add, Ryan, the active account growth that we're seeing, we actually probably watch that even more than new account growth because we've been making big investments in lifecycle marketing and figuring out across all of our platforms, how do you engage that customer in the second and third, fourth purchase. And so just seeing that positive inflection year-over-year I think is a positive. And then, look, the consumer is still in a good spot, but we are seeing lower store traffic and some pullback there. And then we're obviously proactively making some credit actions that'll improve the trajectory into next year. So overall, we feel pretty good about the trends that we're seeing. Ryan Nash : Awesome. Appreciate the color. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up on some of the questions around credit quality. Brian Wenzel, if we -- I know I've heard you talk about some of the moves you made to sort of refine the underwriting some time ago. I mean, is the -- are the benefits of that in front of us so that we should see some more stepped-up improvement in that second derivative on delinquency rates? And then I'm trying to think through some of the questions that were asked before, like shouldn't that really -- that coupled with the tighter underwriting and the slower loan growth should help credit quality? Shouldn't it? So, I mean, is that just built-in conservatism in your credit outlook or what for this year in terms of the flat reserve rate? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. First of all, good morning, Sanjay. Thanks for the question. I think there's a combination where the credit actions -- remember, we started this in second quarter last year into third, and then really started in again the latter part of the first quarter into the second quarter of this year. You see it reflecting in the moderation of the year-over-year change in delinquencies, which we showed on Page 10 of the earnings presentation here. So some of it is being manifested itself in delinquency trends. Obviously, it takes time to season. So I think you would expect the benefit of those actions to kind of continue to go through. Now, again, actions that we put in place in the second quarter this year have probably a little bit more reduced effect on this year, more effect as you exit out of '24 into '25. So it's really a combination. I'd say from an efficacy standpoint, we are not taking or not continuing to take broad-based actions. At this point, we stand ready to do that if something deteriorates. But right now we're continuing with our normal refinements, which are more idiosyncratic at the partner portfolio, product and channel level. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And I have a question for Brian Doubles' follow-up. Maybe you could just talk about the state of potential partnership opportunities or deals for portfolios. Anything changed relative to the previous quarter? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Sure, Sanjay. Look, I would say that we have a pretty healthy pipeline of opportunities that continues to be true. I think, competitively we're certainly differentiated in terms of our technology investments, how we partner, how we integrate, and so that continues to resonate with both our existing partners, but also new prospects. So I feel really good about all that. I think, look, in this environment too, whenever you're in an environment that's a little bit uncertain, you tend to see more rational pricing, a little more discipline across the industry, which again, is a good thing. When we were in the headier days of '21, '22, things could get a little bit irrational when you're pricing at historically low loss rates. We always price through a cycle. We'll continue to do that. But I think the environment right now, across the industry, across the competitive side is pretty rational. I feel really good about how we're positioned and we got a -- we've got a good pipeline of opportunities. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Sanjay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Hi, Rick. Rick Shane : Look, I'd love to talk a little bit, you've moved guidance to sort of the upper end of your prior range, and I'm curious how much of that is a function of timing, favorable timing with PPPC implementation versus late fee, how much is a function potentially of slower loan growth into the second half of the year and a favorable impact on reserves and whatever other fundamental factors might be driving that. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Rick. From a timing perspective, I don't believe that there's anything significant in the timing of the execution. I'd say from an execution standpoint, I think we've hit all our deliverables. Given the process you have to go through to do the amount of things in terms that we've done, we've executed on the timeframe, in the timeframes that we have in place, and they're rolling out according to schedule. So there's nothing really timing-related there. I'd sit back and say moving to the middle end of the range, to the higher end of the range, just really overall business performance. I think we -- while purchase volume might be slightly lower than expectations, it shows the consumer is managing. We don't see them going under stress. So I think as we look through the various elements, your funding costs have stabilized and stabilized and moving into the back half of the year, I think the expenses, which we haven't really talked about, only being up 1%, including the cost of $23 million related to the execution of change in terms otherwise would have been down, I think is a positive as we move forward. So I think we're continuing to execute the business. The business is really focused on what we have to do this year in order to execute both on the core business, the reaction to or the PPPC changes that we're rolling out, as well as the integration of Ally Lending, which we're very happy about and the disposition Pets Best. So the team is focused on execution. That's what I would say drove us to the mid to the higher end of the range. Rick Shane : Great. Brian, thank you very much. It's incredibly helpful. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about capital. So in contrast to many banks that are still dealing with large AOCI marks, you guys appear to have greater clarity on the level of capital that you're going to need to run with. And therefore, it seemed like you may be in a better position to perhaps return the capital in excess of your target a little bit more aggressively relative to those who are still accreting capital to sort of plug that AOCI hole. Can you speak to that dynamic and how we should think about like the trajectory of that excess capital position relative to the 11% target you've talked about historically? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Bill, for the question. We've been on a journey. You've heard me talk about this a number of times. When we separated from our former parent, we started out and got to a peak of CET1 of 18%. And then there's been a journey down where today we're at 12.6%. We have an excess relative to the target. We're continuing on the path, right? But our first priority is always going to be organic RWA growth. Our second is going to be the dividend. And then third will be what we do with share repurchases or inorganic. And Brian talks about the discipline we have around inorganic growth. So we have the ability to do that. I think we're going to be prudent with regard to the way in which we return it back to shareholders. We're not going to just drop it tomorrow because obviously, we have many stakeholders here who would not necessarily agree with that action. But we are on a trajectory and moving towards our target, which has always been our long-term goal. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Thanks, Brian. That's helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up on your expectation of a stable reserve rate at the end of '24 versus '23. It seems like your expectation of a more favorable loss trajectory in your reasonable and supportable forecast period under CECL would be supportive of reserve releases, all else equal. So is the takeaway that your outlook is essentially de-risked and now embeds greater conservatism? Just trying to get a sense for when you'd feel comfortable getting that reserve rate back to the day one level and whether we should be thinking of that more as a 2025 event. Brian Wenzel : Yes, most certainly it's not going to be 2024 event, right? As I said, it's flattish to last year. It really goes back to when do we have greater clarity. Across the industry, everyone has greater clarity with regard to the macroeconomic. When are we going to get back to a more normalized interest rate environment, more normalized inflation environment, which makes the everyday cost for our consumers, a shared consumer across the industry much more manageable? It's that uncertainty that I think will give people pauses in how they run the different scenarios and have their qualitative assessments. That's probably the largest wildcard. Obviously, you're going to have to watch how your portfolio delinquencies develop and mix, but it's really getting clarity on that environment. So again, I think being prudent now is a better course. Bill Carcache : Understood. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Bill. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Dave Rochester : Hi, good morning, guys. Brian Wenzel : Morning. Dave Rochester : By the time we get to October the 1st, will you guys have implemented your PPPC at substantially all of your partners at that point or is there a segment that opted to wait on those until the rule actually takes effect? And how large is that segment, if you have a sense? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, as Brian said, we've completed the first phase that covers a substantial part of the business. We do have one or two partners where we've largely agreed on what we would do, but we are waiting for the rule to be effective. Again, that doesn't change our view that we will fully offset this. We'll get back to pre-late fee ROAs, and we'll still support the customers and underwrite the customers that we do today. Brian Wenzel : The only thing I'd add, Dave, is there is a tail, right, with regard to this, right? Because accounts that we originated in the back half of last year, we wouldn't give them a change in terms six months after we just originated account or three months after we originated the account. So there will be a tail that goes on here for a long period of time as well as the number of inactive accounts that become active. Once they become active, they'll get a CIT. So it takes a long time to get to 100% under any scenario, but this will go on. That's part of normal course. And any time we do a CIT, that is kind of a regular course of action. Dave Rochester : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate that. And then to follow up on Ryan's question from earlier, in the scenario where the late fee rule is shot down regarding the changes that stick. I know you haven't given us a ton of thought yet, and that's understandable. But just based on your early assessment of consumer reactions so far and your dialogue with your partners and the fact that there's a good amount of expense associated with implementing those changes, is there any reason you've seen so far to indicate you would want to unwind the APR changes, or would those be the easiest changes to leave in place? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I think, like Brian said earlier, this will be a discussion with the partners. We'll look at for the portion of the book that we control. We'll look at consumer behavioral changes. It's still really early. These CITs are now just working their way through the statements, and we're just starting to see the customer behavioral changes, which at this point are very slight, but we need to continue to monitor that. As Brian said, we're all over it, and we'll adjust along the way if we feel like we need to. But we're not preparing for a scenario where the rule doesn't go into effect. I think we have to control what we control, and we control the pricing and policy changes and that's what we've done. And we're obviously -- we think we've got a great case in terms of litigating the rule, but it's uncertain. So we've got to focus on what we can control. Dave Rochester : Great. Thanks, guys. Brian Doubles : Yes. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Dave. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Actually, I think all of my questions have been answered, or asked and answered. But I guess I have one incremental one is, you did renew Verizon in the quarter and then you added Virgin. I'm wondering, given just, I guess, the overhang and uncertainty around the late fee situation, how -- have there been any kind of structural changes in how you negotiate these new contracts with that uncertainty in the background? Brian Doubles : Yes. So let me start and I'll ask Brian to comment. Look, first, we're very excited to launch what we think is a very unique, one-of-a-kind program with Virgin Red. It'll span air travel, hotel, cruises. We're tapping into a very strong, loyal customer base. So we could not be more excited to partner with Virgin Red on this new product. Equally as excited to renew Verizon. It's been a strong program for us, great relationship, and so we're really excited about that as well. Certainly, the late fee issue has crept its way into negotiations, new business, renewals, unsurprisingly, but there are ways to structure around this. So we have certainly contemplated an $8 late fee in every program that we've renewed since the rule was published, as well as anything that we've extended. Brian Wenzel : Yes. The only thing I'd add, John, is in that structuring of pricing, we assume late fees go in at $8. To the extent that there's upside, we're protected. To the downside, there may be things that you do on the upside relative to partners. Even when you look at the portfolio we acquired in the second quarter from another issuer, we're relatively protected or are protected relative to the $8 late fee going in place. It's just we're more conservative on pricing. We think it's going to -- as much as we like the chances that the industry has against the rule, we're not going to bank on it pricing a deal that lasts seven years to 10 years. John Hecht : Great. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Thanks, John. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one last question. It will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the '23 vintage, just how that's performing? You've got another quarter under your belt relative to your expectations, and maybe '22. And I know you haven't had as much sort of volatility versus general purpose. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Don. So again, I think level setting, first of all, I'd like to do it against the industry. I think if you go and look to some of the credit bureaus and you look at the industry vintage curves, our relative portfolios are performing better than the industry's curves, both from delinquency and accumulative net charge-off perspective. That being said, we talked extensively over time that there is a shared consumer. We do feel the effects of what other issuers did as they exited the pandemic, adjusting some of their credit criteria or according the credit box in their world, and issued an awful lot of, some of the biggest vintages we've ever seen in the credit card industry. So I use that as a background. I think when you look at delinquencies, and I'll give you some of the details here, Don. When you look at delinquencies, the second half of '21 through the first half of '23 are performing slightly worse than, or worse than 2018 vintage. 2019 gets skewed because you had the year of the pandemic. The second half '23, and what we see, and again, is very early. But when you look at the early indications off of '24, because the credit actions we've taken, they are performing better than the first half of '23. And when you think about a charge-off perspective, the second half of '23 and the first half of '24 are performing better than '18. So I do think some of the modifications that we've made in credit actions are supporting the vintages. We have some of the shared consumer in that '21 into -- partially into the back half of '21 into the early part of '23 that has given us a little bit of the trends above our historical delinquency rate. But again, we feel good about how the vintages are developing. Don Fandetti : Thanks, Brian. Brian Wenzel : Great. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you.",

Please refer to the Company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. Currently all callers have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for your questions following the conclusion of the management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kathryn Miller : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today Synchrony reported strong third quarter results, including net earnings of $789 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.6%, and a return on tangible common equity of 24.3%. These results reflect Synchrony's commitment to driving value for our customers, partners, providers, small businesses, and our shareholders, as the operating environment continues to evolve. During the quarter, we continued to deliver responsible access to credit through powerful omni-channel experiences. Our broad range of flexible financing solutions and compelling value propositions continue to resonate with customers, as they engage across our diversified portfolio. We added 4.7 million new accounts and generated $45 billion of purchase volume. Both new account and purchase volume growth continue to be impacted by a modest pullback in consumer spending, as well as the credit actions that Synchrony has taken since the middle of 2023 to reinforce the credit trajectory of our portfolio in 2024 and beyond. Despite those actions, average active accounts remained stable versus last year, and ending receivables grew 4%. Purchase volume and receivables at the platform level reflected a continuation of the trends we discussed over the course of this year. Customers continue to be selective in how and where they spend, particularly as they manage their spend to navigate the effects of inflation on needs like groceries, utilities, and rent. Platform purchase volume growth range between down 3% and down 7% year-over-year, generally reflecting lower spend per account, as customers moderated both bigger ticket and discretionary spend, particularly in categories like furniture, electronics, cosmetic, and vision, as well as the impact of Synchrony\u2019s credit actions. Receivables growth across the platforms range from 3% to 10% higher versus last year, primarily driven by payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 43% of total purchase volume for the quarter and decreased 2% generally due to more selective consumer spend behavior and the impact of our credit actions. The trends we see in the out-of-partner spend on these products have generally remained consistent with those at the platform level. Our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases, particularly around larger ticket categories such as home furnishing, travel and entertainment, and are prioritizing non-discretionary spend like groceries and pharmacy. As we would generally expect, our customers across credit grades are spending less per transaction in most categories, with average transaction values declining 3% versus last year. More specifically, our non-prime customers reduced their average transaction values by about 5% versus last year, while prime transaction values moderated by 3%. Our super-prime customers continue to drive more out-of-partner spend, the transaction value declines of around 2% year-over-year. That said, customers across credit grades are transacting with relatively stable frequency compared to last year, which has partially offset the impact of lower transaction values. From a payment behavior perspective, we continue to see relative stability in our non-prime segments. Meanwhile, our prime and super-prime customers have continued to gradually shift from above minimum payment to minimum payment. The proportion of less than minimum payments in our portfolio remains below the 2017 to 2019 average across all credit segments. When taken together, we believe the spend and payment trends we're observing across our portfolio reflect a consumer that is making healthy decisions that align with their respective priorities and budget. And as our customer needs and priorities continue to shift, Synchrony remains focused on delivering financial solutions with compelling value propositions and broad utility for wherever life takes them. This ability to evolve and enhance our offerings also allows us to deliver loyalty and resilient risk-adjusted returns for our partners, providers and merchants and strengthen Synchrony\u2019s position as a partner of choice. During the third quarter we added or renewed more than 15 partners including Dick's Sporting Goods and Gibson and strategic partnerships like Albertsons. We're proud to extend our partnership with Dick\u2019s, which builds on our more than 20-year-long relationship. We will maintain our commitment to athletes through our Score Rewards credit card program by providing the ability to earn rewards twice as fast, exclusive member only offers, and digital account management. Athletes will be able to continue using these cards online and in stores across the company's 800 plus retail locations, including Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Sport, Golf Galaxy, and Public Lands. Meanwhile, Synchrony's partnership with Gibson, the most iconic brand in the music industry, represents what we believe to be an industry first. Through Gibson's launch of a direct-to-consumer credit program, which is available on Gibson.com and at the Gibson Garage Nashville flagship store. Gibson will also participate as part of our manufacturer OEM sponsorship program to drive customer engagement with their dealer framework, as well as the Synchrony Music and Sound Network. Synchrony is also excited to launch a strategic partnership between CareCredit and Albertsons Companies, a leading food and drug retailer in our communities. This collaboration allows customers to use their CareCredit card to pay for select health and wellness items in nearly 2200 Albertsons company stores, which includes Albertsons, Safeway, Bonds, Acme, Shaw's, and Jewel-Osco. This adds to our expanding list of partners such as Sam's Club, Walgreens, and Walmart, where CareCredit is accepted for payment of select health and wellness products and services. And last, [we Synchrony] (ph) is proud to launch a first of its kind payment experience for pet parents with our patent pending insurance reimbursement functionality that will streamline the process for managing pet health care expenses. Customers who have both a CareCredit and Pets Best Insurance product will now be able to have their Pets Best Insurance claims directly reimbursed to their CareCredit, health and wellness credit card. This seamless new technology reflects Synchrony's focus on driving best-in-class experiences and through our collaboration with Independence Pet Holdings, build on our commitment to enable more pets to get the veterinary care they need. Whether it's through the delivery of scalable, innovative financial solutions that empower our customers or the addition and renewal of partnerships that span most consumer spend categories. Synchrony is powering access, flexibility, and utility for our customers and partners alike. And in turn, we are driving greater long-term value for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results, demonstrating the resilience of our differentiated business model and our ability to execute across our key strategic priorities to deliver consistently compelling outcomes for our stakeholders. Ending loan receivables reached $102 million in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 4% compared to last year, as the benefit of approximately 60 basis point decrease in payment rate more than offset the 4% decline in purchase volume. Net revenue grew 10% to $3.8 billion due to the combined impact of higher interest and fees, lower RSA, and higher other income. Net interest income increased 6% to $4.6 billion as interest and fees grew 7%, primarily reflecting growth in average loan receivables and a higher loan receivable yield. Our loan receivable yield grew 30 basis points due to the combined impact of our product, pricing, and policy changes or PPPCs and lower payment rate, partially offset by higher reversals. Total interest-bearing liabilities cost was 4.78%, 44 basis points higher year-over-year, due to higher benchmark rates. RSAs of $914 million were 3.57% of average loan receivables in the third quarter and declined $65 million versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs. And other income increased to $119 million, primarily related to the impact of our PPPC related fees, which were partially offset by the impact of our Pets Best disposition and venture investment gains and losses. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.6 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $47 million reserve build. Other expenses grew 3% to $1.2 billion which was driven by costs relating to the Ally Lending acquisition, technology investments and preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change, partially offset by lower operational losses. The preparatory expenses related to Late Fee rule change reflected $11 million of incremental costs related to both the execution of our PPPCs and implementation costs of the rule itself should become effective. Even with these incremental costs, the efficiency ratio was 31.2% for the third quarter an improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus last year, reflecting Synchrony's continued cost discipline and commitment to driving operational leverage in our business. Taken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $789 million or $1.94 per diluted share. This produced a return on average assets of 2.6% and a return on tangible common equity of 24.3%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 9. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.78% versus 4.40% in the prior year and 16 basis points above our historical average from the third quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.33% versus 2.06% in the prior year. And 20 basis points above our historical average from the third quarter of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge-off rate was 6.06% in the third quarter versus 4.60% in the prior year and 97 basis points above our historical average from the third quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.79%, which was generally consistent with the second quarter coverage ratio of 10.74%. As shown on Slide 10, the credit actions we've taken for mid-2023 through early 2024 are improving our delinquency trajectory as the rate of year-over-year growth in both 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates continue to decelerate. We'll continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance, as well as credit trends for the broader industry given our share consumer and will take additional credit actions, if necessary. While the actions we have taken since last year have reduced new account and purchase volume growth in the short-term, we expect it will strengthen our portfolio's position as we exit 2024 and support our ability to deliver our targeted risk-adjusted returns over the long term. Turning to Slide 11. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. During the third quarter, Symphony grew our direct deposits by approximately $780 million, reduced our broker deposits by $1.5 billion and issued $750 million of senior unsecured fixed-to-floating rate notes due in 2030. At quarter end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding while secured and unsecured debt, each representing 8% of our total funding, respectively. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $22.4 billion, a $1.9 billion increase versus last year and represented 18.8% of total assets, a 60 basis point increase from last year. Focusing on our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will make a final transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, 30 basis points higher than last year's 12.8%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3%, 70 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 70 basis points to 16.4%. And our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 24.5% compared to 22.9% last year. Since we returned $399 million to shareholders during the third quarter which consisted of $300 million in share repurchases and $99 million in common stock dividends. As of quarter end, we had $700 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 30, 2025. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. Turning to our outlook. Synchrony remains focused on executing our key strategic priorities and taking the appropriate actions to reinforce our business performance for years to come, particularly our ability to deliver our long-term financial target on average over time. We have been closely monitoring our portfolio and believe that both our credit actions and the PPPCs are performing in-line with our expectations. With the first quarter of our PPPCs in effect, we are experiencing slightly lower paper statement fee income than expected with stronger enrollment in e-bill. We're also experiencing less customer attrition than expected, which is a testament to the value proposition of the products we offer. We will continue to track the financial and operational impact on our customers, partners and portfolios to determine alongside our partners, whether any refinements to our strategies are warranted to achieve our share objectives of sustainable risk-adjusted growth at our targeted long-term returns. As a reminder, specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rule change and our PPPCs, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of late fee related litigation that was filed in March, the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur, as a result of late fee rule change and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the [PPPCs] (ph) and the broader industry have implemented as a result of the new rule. Outcomes and actual performance related to any of these uncertainties could impact our outlook. With that framework, let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2024. We expect the consumer to continue to manage our spending, which -- when combined with our credit actions, should result in low single-digit decline in purchase volume for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect payment rates to moderate, which when combined with the purchase volume expectations, should contribute to low single-digit growth and ending loan receivables compared to last year. Given that the late fee rule was not implemented on October 1, as assumed in our previous outlook and the continued uncertainty with regard to late fee litigation, we assume the late fee rule will not become effective in 2024. As a result, we expect net interest income to remain sequentially flat, as the impacts of our PPPCs are offset by seasonally higher reversals. Other income is expected to remain consistent with the third quarter level. RSA will continue to align program and company performance and should decrease sequentially on a dollar basis and as a percentage of average loan receivables, reflecting the net impact of seasonally higher net charge-offs on flat revenue. Other expenses expect to increase sequentially with the seasonally higher growth. And from a credit perspective, we expect delinquencies to follow seasonality in the fourth quarter. We also continue to expect the second half 2024 net charge-off rate will be lower than the first half. Lastly, we continue to expect our year-end 2024 reserve rate to be generally in-line with the year-end 2023 rate. Given these assumptions, Synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per share between $8.45 and $8.55 for the full year 2024. The approximate $0.80 improvement from the midpoint of our prior full year EPS outlook reflects a combination of factors. First, the [indiscernible] assumption that the late fee rule will be implemented on October 1, 2024, and therefore also the removal of the related benefit from the RSA offset. Second, the impact of our PPPCs and the increase in RSA associated with those changes; and finally, strong performance of our core business, as we enter the fourth quarter. In summary, Synchrony has continued to deliver on key strategic priorities that matter most to our stakeholders. We remain confident in the measures we've taken thus far to strengthen our business in an evolving environment, and believe we're well positioned to drive resilient risk-adjusted returns over the long term. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Synchrony is leveraging our proprietary data and analytics, our deep lending expertise and our innovative digital capabilities to provide seamless customer experiences, compelling value propositions and enhanced utility with each customer interaction we have. We are increasingly anywhere our customers want to be met with financial solutions that drive loyalty and sales for our partners, providers and small businesses, and we are consistently deepening our leadership position, while driving sustainable risk-adjusted growth and long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. A - Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hi, good morning everyone. Brian Doubles : Hi, Ryan. Brian Wenzel : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Nash : Brian, maybe you could unpack the NII guide for us a little bit. I understand 4Q is seasonally lower from reversals as you highlighted. But how did the PPPCs fit in, along with your liability-sensitive position, which I don't think you highlighted in your comments. And then I guess just given forward curve expectations outside of seasonality. Do you expect the NIM to have a continued upward bias over the next several quarters? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So when you think about NII sequentially just step into the fourth quarter, the first, when you think about the trends that are into delinquency and units flowing in delinquency, dollars assessed on late fees should be down in 4Q versus 3Q. You combine that with higher reversals that is essentially offsetting the positivity you should see and you will see on interest income and the benefit that we see in interest expense. So it kind of washes out in the quarter, more just a function of how the favorability from delinquencies impacting late fees. As you start to think out against the net interest margin for a second, you should continue to see the interest component relative to the PPPC's, as well as the [raw rates] (ph) payment rates decline, increase and guide the NIM higher. And you should also see a benefit of interest expense. That will lag a little bit because of the reset of the debt stack, particularly in the CDs that happens over the first half of the year. So there is generally more tailwinds as you think about margin, as you move into next year, but it's going to be a little bit lagged given the reset of CDs in the first half of the year, both of which happened in the second quarter. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then as my follow-up question, your outlook for credit calls for delinquencies to follow seasonality. I guess, first do you expect losses to do the same. And then in terms of delinquencies following seasonality, like what does that mean for the trajectory of losses into '25? And if they do follow seasonality, can losses move back below 6% into next year? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes. So Ryan, we'll be back in January to talk really, really about next year. But I think there is a couple of things I would think about credit as a whole. First, there is probably four points that I raised. Number one, the delinquency trends themselves, we are seeing strong entry rate, which is better than the pre-pandemic period, which is continuing to benefit the flow into delinquency. We're seeing early stage delinquency really being stable, as far as its performance month-on-month. And then we are seeing some improvement in the last several months in late-stage collections, which are positive. So I think delinquency trends are doing fairly well. When you think about that relative to seasonality the last several months, we've actually been low to mid-single digits better than seasonality when you look at '17 to '19 period. So that's a favorable trend that continues to go back -- continue to go back the last several months. Again I think I've highlighted publicly, the vintage performance both in the second half of 2023, the first half of '24, albeit very early, it is trending better than the '18 vintages. And again, I think you can see both in the purchase volume and the new account origination, most certainly the credit actions are having some effect there, which I think bolsters credit, as we move back through. Our underwriting is designed to give us that 5.5% to 6%. So the intention -- and the intention would be that we would get back to that point. Again, we are moving down. And you can see in the slides that the year-over-year growth in delinquencies both 30-plus and 90-plus continue to decline. So again, tracking to our expectations, as we move through the remaining part '24. Ryan Nash : Thanks Brian. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Ryan. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Terry Ma with Barclays. Please go ahead. Terry Ma : Hi, thank you. Good morning. So you called out a 30 basis point year-over-year increase in loan yields from PPPCs, lower payment rates and offset by interest reversals. Any way you can kind of quantify each of those components? And maybe just help us think about how that PPPC component kind of grows into next year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Terry, we are not going to break out the individual components of the PPPCs by line items, but most certainly, the benefit is flowing through on the interest yield line. Number one, you can -- it is matched a little bit when you think sequentially given the gain in the second quarter on the Visa shares. But clearly, it is showing up in other income. Again, this is the first full quarter that we have the first phase of the CITs in. We continue to expect that to build into next year. I think when we come back in January, we'll try to provide a little bit more view on that. I think when you take a step back Terry the important thing, and I highlighted in my prepared remarks is the actions we've taken have generally been in-line with our expectations. There is a positivity in the fact that customer attrition is not as been high as our expectations. Now again, that would have had a reserve release. So it is negative from a financial perspective, but it's really better from a customer standpoint, as they recognize the value propositions of our cards we did highlight paper statements were a little bit lower than expectations, partially due to softeners, partially due to our accounts being a little bit lower than expectations but all-in-all good. Adoption of e-bill and our customers' willingness to change behavior and do that has been positive. So when we look at that, generally speaking, at a line. So even though there is a little bit less customer attrition, that generally means the core is performing a little bit better. So as we sit here today, we are feeling good about where we are, but we'll continue to watch customer behavior and we'll certainly watch the market and a lot of issuers have already started to implement changes as this rule becomes effective. Terry Ma : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on credit. It seems credit performance is more or less performing in-line with your expectations. But as I look at the charge-off rate for this year, it's running somewhat north of 6%. I don't want to tie it to your initial guide, but maybe just talk about how credit performance has evolved relative to kind of what you expected coming into this year? Brian Wenzel : Yes. The way I think about it, Terry, is we took some actions really in the late first quarter, early second quarter, again to try to set up and protect ourselves against any deterioration that could happen late this year into next year. So we took those actions. We'll certainly -- I think you've seen some of the purchase volume, which is slightly lower than our expectations. That unfortunately has an impact on the denominator which brings the rate a little bit higher than what you think about. But again, I think the fact that we are not taking broad-based actions today, gives us some credit, some confidence in credit. And we'll certainly you\u2019ve heard my points with Ryan a little bit earlier around the four things that we looked at to say, listen we feel good about where we are as we enter into the fourth quarter. Terry Ma : Great. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Terry. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. Brian, you mentioned some improvement over the last few months in late-stage collections. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that if that's just kind of mix catch-up. And generally speaking, is it harder to execute on collection today versus prior. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you. Good morning Don. Let me start with the latter part of your question. Is it harder to collect today, most certainly I think if you look at this versus a number of years ago, we're certainly making customer contacts a little bit tougher. But that's where we've expanded and through the pandemic, investing in digital collections, investing in other forms and to other channels in which we can connect with the customer in order to kind of get those collections done such as text and things like that. So it is a little bit tougher. I think it is a game where you have to deploy more products than you do have to do just get more collectors on the phone and most certainly, the rules have evolved where the number of collections you can make to someone have declined. But I think we've adapted to that. I think when you think about the late stage for a second, when your early stage has deteriorated, quite a bit what flows into the back potentially has the ability to be slightly better and able to collect. So while I look at the late stage, it is still performing worse than 2019 and 2020, the pre-pandemic period, it has started to improve more recently, which we take as optimistic with regard to performance. But again, it is worse than what it was. And you would expect a little bit of that if you have very positive entry rate into delinquency what flows in is a little bit tougher to collect. So we would have anticipated both early stage and late stage to be worse. But right now, in the last, I'd say, several months we've seen a little bit of improvement in that late-stage collections. Don Fandetti : Got it. And my follow-up, just -- I know there is a lot of concern around the low end. It seems like your customers and the loans are kind of managing changing behavior continues to change behavior, but it doesn't seem like it's sort of accelerating in terms of a pressure point. Is that fair? Brian Wenzel : Yes. I think that's absolutely fair. I mean we look at it on a couple of different ways. When you look at payment rate, people making payments when we look at the trends by credit rate, which if you say that somewhat aligns with income decile you are seeing more of the movement in the prime so that [$6.60 to $7.80] (ph) range, you're seeing a little bit more movement there into mid-days, you\u2019re not really seeing as much movement of the non-prime in there. I want to say the movement into mid-day is about 1 point difference on the prime and it was half of that in the non-prime. So we're not seeing stress when it comes to payment. I think, when you look at the K-shaped recovery, clearly affordability has impacted some of the lower-end consumer, and they pulled back spending and they are managing fairly well. So I think when we look at those two combined, we don't see stress in the consumer. We see them actually doing somewhat rational things right now. So it's more a normalization. But again, when you still look back against the prime customers, they are paying a rate still above on 2019 level. So we don't necessarily see signs of stress in the low-end today. Thanks Don. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowens. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. So Brian, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the slowdown in spending volume and sort of separate it between the impacts of kind of your own tightening consumer preferences and then perhaps also the policy changes. One of the questions we've gotten is, do you think -- I know you said that attrition wasn't affected by that, but what about spending volume? So those three factors. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. First of all, good morning Moshe. Thanks for the question. So let me start where you ended. When you look at the actions in which we took in the portfolio with regards to pricing changes in the like. The positive news is that we are able to have a control group in which we tested against that. So when we look at volume changes between the people who receive CITs and those who didn't receive the CITs, there is not a material difference. So we somewhat have a base to say that the actions haven't either created solid attrition that we are not aware of. So that's one, I think, the latter part of your question. I think when you look at the purchase in of itself, what you see is we'll certainly across the board, almost transaction values coming down, so the consumer is trading down a bit. We see that and I use the example, mattresses, where the frequency maybe hasn't moved down as much, but the average transaction value has moved down as consumers say, listen, I'm willing to purchase a mattress, but then again I'm not willing to spend $4,000, I'm going to go down to something at $2,500, and we've seen that across the board of retailers. And I think you see it, generally speaking, across the board, in discretionary items, even in our health and wellness business, you see it in cosmetics and LASIK, things that can be deferred, that's a short-term impact. Most certainly, that will create a tailwind at some point because those types of procedures don't go away. And you're right, some of the actions we took, we had a modest impact on purchase volume, a more meaningful impact on new accounts in order to make sure that the origination of the books are at risk-adjusted returns that are attractive to us. Moshe Orenbuch : Maybe to kind of at a high level for either, Brian. As you think about the underlying economic environment, we've been in a period where wage growth has exceeded inflation, although the consumer still feels kind of pressured and is still in that process, as you pointed out of trading down. When you think about the sort of things that you are looking for to try and jump start or reverse some of those tightening, what are the things that you'd be looking for kind of from a macro standpoint? And maybe talk a little bit about that. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes, Moshe, maybe I'll start on this one. Look, I think to Brian's point, the consumer is still in pretty good shape. The trends that we're seeing are pretty similar across the industry. Inflation is having an impact. But I think to your point, the strong labor market is definitely helping to offset some of that pressure. And consumers are slowing spend, but they are doing it in a very in a rational, disciplined way. We actually like the fact that we can see that they are managing to a budget. They're navigating the higher cost of goods. This isn't a new trend. We started to see it early this year. You are seeing it a little bit more broad-based right now, but not in a concerning way. I think from a credit perspective, this is exactly what we wanted to see. Some of that is pulled back on behalf of the consumer, and some of that is just the actions that we took. But again, I think similar to credit, you are just seeing spend kind of move back to a normalized level. I think when credit levels off and you start to see some stability, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there. And I think when those clouds start to clear then you start to get back to what we would consider more normal growth in the business, driving new accounts back to levels that would be similar to prior to this year. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Moshe. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks good morning. Maybe just to close the loop on credit, Brian Wenzel. Maybe just talk about the reserve rate trend line, maybe how we should think about the direction into next year? I know you're not giving guidance for next year. I know you're not giving guidance by year-end. But like just to think about when we migrate back to some normalized level of reserve rate. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you good morning, Sanjay. I think the guidance we kind of give you is that the reserve rate at the end of this year will generally be in-line with reserve rate at the end of last year, which was 10.26% or 10.3%. I know people are probably focusing on the term generally. Obviously, when you look at a year-end number, and that's a big seasonal factor just really how the receivable develops and how it plays out. I think most certainly, I've given you some of the delinquency trends that builds into the client data model. And again, I think we've seen -- while it's been a little bit choppy. The macroeconomic environment being a little bit more stable. We're pleased that the Federal Reserve did lower rates. So again, I think as we exit out of this year generally in-line with last year, I think you kind of have some indication how you think about the loss trajectory. And most certainly, I don't think we see anything today that says to us, we are not going to continue to march back towards that day 1 CECL, we'll certainly, as you see, the delinquency levels, which are slightly above where we were in the pre-pandemic period right, when you compare it back both 30 plus and 90 plus. As that moves back towards normal, we would expect the reserve rate to continue to flow down as the mix shift. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. And maybe on the CFPB late fee rules, I guess, Brian when you talked a lot about sort of the behavior of the consumer. But has anything changed in terms of when you expect to fully mitigate the impact to the extent it goes in sometime next year. And then \u2013 and maybe if it doesn't happen, like what's -- how should we think about the game plan if it doesn't go into effect? Do you claw back some of the changes that you've made? Or do you do other things, but I'm just trying to think through the implications there. Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Let me start and see if Brian has any additional comments. To your first part of your question Sanjay, it doesn't really impact the point of neutrality, right? It really goes from the starting point to the neutrality point what's the trough level depending upon when the late fee rule kind of comes in place. So I don't think, it is necessarily one where we look back and say the early performance we've seen changes that exit rate of neutrality based upon our analysis. So I think that piece of it remains in place. With regard to when the rule may become effective, we'll probably do that sometime either in the fourth quarter or January if we have more information when we have a better assumption with regard to when that rule does go in place. We are operating as a company, and we'll certainly, the administration has taken a view that they want the late fee rule in. And we're planning as if it's going to go in, it's just the point of entry of when it goes in. So your question really around is there a clawback, people use the term roll back. As a company, we haven't spent any real time thinking about that. Again, we view it's going to come into effect in some way. And if it doesn't, then we have to have a high degree of certainty that it wouldn't go back into play. And then it's really a conversation for those that share the economic impact of this. And then for our properties, we'd have to do that assessment. But again, we haven't spent a lot of time in this. We believe the rule will go in effect, and we are planning as a company to execute that. I don't know, Brian do you have any further comments you want to --. Brian Doubles : Yes. No. I think look, we had to plan as if there was going to be an $8 late fee because it takes time for these offsets to bleed in. We work with our partners on that. It's hard to speculate on whether $8 actually goes into effect, as they were moved to safe harbor. There's a lot of different ways that this could play out. But we're prepared for all of those events. And in terms of rolling anything back, I think, like Brian said, that's a discussion that we have -- with our partners just like when we rolled out the initial pricing actions. And we operate very transparently with them and we did when we rolled out the pricing changes, and we'll do that depending on the eventual outcome of late fee. Again, our goal hasn't changed here. We're trying to protect our partners and continue to improve the same customers that we do today. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Great, Sanjay. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mihir Bhatia : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Maybe to start, I just wanted to turn to net interest margins for a little bit. How do you expect them to perform in a declining rate environment. I ask because your portfolio is a little different than some of your large peers with a little bit more fixed rate in it. So just maybe if you could walk through the moving pieces there and also any deposit beta assumptions you'll be willing to share? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Good morning Mihir and thanks for your question. So I think when you think about a framework for net interest margin, I'm going to put aside a little bit of the ALR mix, and I'll come back to that at the end. I think when you first think about the interest in field, interest in the component yield piece of this, you should be getting a little bit of a benefit as the impact of prime rate movements for that portion of the business for that portion of the business to flow through right, because prime lags the way which we build it. So hopefully, we get a benefit on the floating rate component of it. Well, certainly, as payment rate continues to come down, the revolve rate component should rise. So those two should create tailwinds inside the interest and fee side of the NIM component. I think when you think about the funding side of the component, both the investment portfolio as well as the interest expense. Obviously, we're at the follow market. Traditionally, we lagged the market a little bit from a digital banking perspective. I think what you've seen here in the third quarter is that digital banks have been a little bit more proactive lowering rates earlier than normal, given there are probably funding needs. So we followed them down. So I think that creates an additional tailwind. When you think about that for a second, you have to break it out between the high-yield savings component, which has a more immediate impact. But again, it's probably 40% of our retail deposits. And then you have the 60% of CDs, a bulk of which will reprice in the first half and we'll certainly more than, I want to say, 75% repriced entirely during next year, but a bulk of it really repriced in the first half of the year, a lot of which is in the second quarter given the way in which we originated certificates this year. So again, that lags a little bit on some of the earlier Fed movements but should be able to capture that rate movement down as we move back in. And the last thing I'm bringing is ALR is a little bit of a wildcard when it comes to NIM. I look at it today, if we're paying someone 4.3% on a high-yield savings, getting 4.9% from the Fed, it is a positive economic position for the company. So I'm not necessarily sure I want to take liquidity down at that point because we're going to need it as we begin to exit and grow here from this period of time. So again, if that turns more negative or flat, we'll rethink how much liquidity we carry. So those are the moving pieces, I think, are here to kind of give you some sense on how you should think about NIM. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching back to the purchase volume and just following up on, I think that is Moshe's questions. Just wanted to make sure I understand. What gives you confidence that purchase volume decline, I guess more purchase volumes have stabilized here, it is down low single digit level. And relatedly, are there certain platforms which you look at, which are leading indicators of where purchase volumes are going or consumer financial health? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Obviously, we look at the trends at daily, and we watch daily sales and see where they flow and watch the -- what I would call, a calendar adjusted year-over-year view and a kind of daily year-over-year view. So I think we try to gain insights to see whether or not we see trends. And I think we see stability where we are. Brian mentioned earlier, again, we started to see a decline really in the second quarter and accelerated into the third quarter, but now it's somewhat stabilized. Again holiday is always an interesting period of time how promotional will be and which retailers went win or lose there. So that's a little bit of a wildcard, but I think generally speaking, when we look at the spending behavior patterns, broadly speaking in the aggregate, we don't see things that are continuing to slow. I think when we further break that down by what I would call the credit rate pieces of it, it's been fairly consistent where your higher credit rates continue to be higher than your lower credit rates with regard to what they are consuming. So I think we look at that and say, okay, there is some stability heading into the holiday season. I think to your point, is there a platform that leads your client, I think you have to look at it and say, is there platforms that are much more discretionary or there are ones that aren't, right? So I think you're going to see the ones that have more discretionary spend, maybe a little bit more down than others. You still see strength in certain parts of the portfolio inside of the platform. So example, [bets] (ph) performing better than other pieces inside health and wellness, that should continue. Brian Doubles : Well, I think the other thing is if you just go back and think about the two years prior to this, we're coming off of record levels of consumer spend, not just in our business but across the industry. And I think we all knew at some point, inflation was going to catch up to the consumer, particularly at the lower income levels, and we're starting to see that. So the slowdown is not necessarily a bad thing in this environment. Mihir Bhatia : All right. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Mihir. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries : Yeah, thanks. You mentioned earlier that you started to see others implement changes. Just interested to get your thoughts on kind of what you've learned from that, whether you've decided you need to recalibrate to remain competitive, it doesn't really sound like it just given the low attrition or alternatively, whether you kind of missed an opportunity to change terms with some borrowers that you viewed as more marginal. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So again, we maintain a competitive screen of those people who are in the partnership base business. You don't necessarily look at broad-based general purpose cards who have a different competitive dynamic relative to their value propositions. But when we look at people who have implemented changes in the partnership side from a competitive standpoint, they generally have done similar types of things relative to APRs. Some have done things with APR [save fees] (ph). So I think we look at that landscape, and I think we feel comfortable with the actions that we've taken. And again, we look more so to how our portfolio performs. Our relationships with our merchants and the value proposition we have with our customers. Clearly, the pricing of a credit product has to resonate with the value proposition that they get. If those two are out of equilibrium, you are going to have a situation where the consumer is not going to want your products. So it's more we're focused on ourselves. I think when we look at the competitive screen, I think we think about it as being in-line with and we are not necessarily an outlier relative to our peers. Mark DeVries : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then on the guidance for reserve coverage at the end of the year, it implies a bigger kind of step down seasonally than we saw in the last couple of years. Could you just talk about what's driving that? Brian Wenzel : Well, certainly, I think when you think about the reserve coverage rate, it is certainly a forward-looking view on how you think losses will be over a reasonable period of time, number one. And two, are there other things that aren't in your quantitative model that you need to account for macroeconomic being one. I think as we think about the end of the year and think about the loss content through the delinquency we see today and how we feel about the macro I think we feel comfortable, it's generally going to be in-line with what we had at the end of last year. Mark DeVries : Okay, thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Most have been asked and answered. I'm wondering, the health and wellness segment has always been a good contributor to growth. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing similar kind of spend trends from a discretionary non-discretionary perspective in that category. Is there anything else to call out there that might be different from the kind of the rest of the portfolio? Brian Doubles : Yes, John, let me start on this and then hand it to Brian. I think look, the health and wellness segment has been a big area of focus for us over the last couple of years, we think. We've got the right to win in that space. It is a huge market, $400 billion roughly. We've seen a little bit of a pullback recently. But if you look over a little bit longer period of time, we've definitely been able to accelerate the growth there. We think we've got a great value proposition. We've got a well-recognized brand. Actually, we get the best customer NPS and customer satisfaction scores with those products. So we feel great about how we're positioned in health and wellness. Not surprisingly, where you've seen some pullback more broadly across the business has been in bigger ticket discretionary purchases, and you are seeing some of that in the CareCredit space. Again, nothing concerning from our perspective, you're still seeing largely better growth there than you are and the rest of the business is based on the investments that we've made to-date. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Just maybe to add a little bit more color. I think when you look inside the health and wellness sales platform and think about the diversity, again a highlighted pets up 4% year-over-year. So there are pieces of that portfolio that are doing well, cosmetics down 6%, et cetera. You see some things and we talk about the consumer being discretionary, some of your high ticket dental, which is more of a deferrable expense for some that's down. So I think you look at that. The positive news we take out of that platform, again the reason the card is up to 65% which is up 500 basis points from the [rest of] (ph) last year. So again, Brian highlights the Net Promoter Score and the likability of this product, the value proposition and the brand of this product resonates with those consumers. So again, we continue to see the use, and we'll certainly -- it's an area where I think when people start to lean back into some of the more discretionary type procedures that are not medical that we'll begin to see that lift. And again having 10% loan growth year-over-year is still a very strong part of the portfolio and part of our company strategy. John Hecht : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I know you guys are preparing for a variety of outcomes with the late fee backdrop. I'm wondering, can you give us a sort of an update on where it stands on litigation. Is there anything on the docket or on the calendar that we should be looking to that might represent an event that could give us a little bit more color about what's going to happen there? Brian Wenzel : Yes, John, what I'd say is there was a hearing that was held at the end of August. Most certainly, right now, we are waiting for the and the plants are waiting for the decision with regard to the motion that's in front of the core, which is both about venue and the standing on one of the plaintiffs in the case. There is not a timetable for that district court to respond to that motion. So we are waiting for that. You then go into whether or not one of the parties who levers on the other side of that, whether or not they would take action with the Fifth Circuit to appeal it or whether or not the next motion would be around the injunction itself and whether or not the injunction itself should be lifted from there. So again, I think we are in a waiting game. I think it's fair to say that anyone who's trying to predict this has been wrong. So we are not in the prediction business today. So we continue to operate the business as if the late fee rule will go in. And we'll obviously wait what the court says about the litigation. But obviously we feel good that the merits of litigation there, but really, it is inherently uncertain. Brian Doubles : I mean, John, if you think about it, we are prepared and our entire plan was enacted to offset what is a worst case, which was $8 by October 1. Obviously, that is come and gone. It is difficult to speculate on when this is actually going to become effective. But if you think about it as all the pricing actions that we rolled out, policy changes, et cetera, were done assuming an October 1 implementation date and $8. And so as we kind of buy time, that's helpful from that perspective. But again, we weren't -- we didn't have the luxury of waiting. We acted very quickly here and rolled out the pricing changes and they are performing as expected. John Hecht : Great. I appreciate that. Thanks very much. Brian Doubles : Great. John, have a good day. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Adelson : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question guys. I just wanted to circle back on the loan growth outlook and some of the credit actions you've taken. It sounds like if I'm hearing it right, you maybe have slowed the intensity of these credit actions you took earlier in the year. So just assuming you keep that stance in place today, does that mean the slowing trend you are looking for exiting the year kind of at this low single-digit growth rate, maybe you can reverse itself into next year? Or what would it take for that to reaccelerate? And how should we think eventually about the timelines you are getting back to that high single-digit kind of long-term growth rate that you look for? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks, Jeff, for the question. And good morning. The first thing I just want to clarify, when we take action, a lot of its strategy actions that aren't necessarily a single point in time. So for instance, some of the actions we took around debt consolidation loans are student loans, to some degree that -- that strategy trips today on actually happen. So they're ongoing. They're not new actions. They're the same actions just whether an account is applicable to that action. So again, the actions that we are taking today are more idiosyncratic based upon a partner channel or product performance relative to the risk adjusted return. I think when you think about how credit actions play out and how the consumer plays out, Brian highlighted earlier, most certainly we\u2019re in a period of time, it's a little bit more transitory, right? So you have affordability issues for some of the lower end, lower income consumers. Hopefully, with interest rates coming down and inflation coming down, that abates a bit and take some of that pressure off. Remember, a lot of the pressure on our credit today stems not necessarily from economics of the consumer, but more that back too much credit than putting the system in the '21 to early '23 year, there has to work its way through the system. I think as that begins to receive, which I think you're seeing in certain issuers across the industry, that gives us a little bit of a tailwind which says that we can begin to unwind some of the restricted credit actions that we took over the past two years, potentially in the latter part of '25. But again, that is going to be based upon performance. So I don't think this is a long-term trend on growth. It is probably a good thing in this period where the credit is a little bit more uncertain, but obviously our long-term framework and our models are built to deliver 7% to 10% lower sales of growth. Jeff Adelson : And as my follow-up on -- I know you are not sizing the PPPC driver in the line, but could you maybe talk about how you do your tracking versus that initial $650 million to $700 million you were talking about earlier in the year? And just maybe remind us of any of the PPPC changes you're holding off on at this point until the late fee rule come through, therefore of if it comes through rather? Brian Wenzel : Yes. The way I think about it, Jeff, is certainly in-line with -- as I talk about customer attrition being lower, that's a swing between BAU bucket in this bucket. So again, I'd sit back and say, if you were to take a step back and go to 10,000 feet, I think you'd say the PPPC actions, PPPC actions generally are in line with and [correspond performing] (ph) a little bit better. But again, at the point I brought up earlier, the point of neutrality as we look at the analysis hasn't changed for us. It is really just the trough. So when does the rule come effective and our trajectory to there. But the point hasn't pushed out. I know we haven't really talked about that because we want to be able to understand when that rule goes in place. And as soon as it does, we'll certainly provide that neutrality point. But again, things are performing generally in-line and the core has performed a little bit better than our expectations, which I think is reflected in the outlook on Page 12. Jeff Adelson : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we are at our allotted time for questions. We will have time for one more. We'll take our final question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I was afraid Jeff was going to run out the clock on me. Look, I realized that CECL reserve as a thought exercise, and I realize that guidance on your reserve rate is a thought exercise on the thought exercise. I'm curious, though if we look at the third quarter reserve rate, it is basically at a cyclical high. And you are guiding for the fourth quarter back to '23 levels. You basically have 16 days of incremental information, and it feels like you've gone from a very cautious outlook to a more or less cautious outlook. What changed or what mechanically is driving the sort of decline that Mark DeVries at pointed out as well? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Good morning. Rick, I'm glad that we run the clock out. I know you got to ask your question. Simply put it really goes back to denominator. Your loss content right now is big, right? I mean you can most certainly in your model, rule what the fourth quarter loss number should look like and what the first quarter dollar losses should look like. It really just becomes the denominator. So I don't view as saying that we're trying to be any more cautious or guide to something that says we fundamentally see a different credit trajectory, more so it is just more the mechanics of the calculation of taking your reserve over an end-of-period loan number. Rick Shane : Got it, okay. Thank you very much guys. Brian Doubles : Thanks Rick. Brian Wenzel : Thanks Rick, have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn and good morning, everyone. I'd like to first take a moment to acknowledge all those who have been affected by the devastation of the California wildfires. Synchrony has colleagues, customers, partners, and providers that were impacted. And while we do not expect a meaningful financial impact on our business, we are monitoring the situation closely and offering support in a number of ways to all those affected. Moving to Synchrony\u2019s fourth quarter performance, we added 5 million new accounts, generated $48 billion in purchase volume, and grew ending loan receivables by 2%. In addition, we continued to see improvement in our portfolio's year-over-year delinquency trends. Our RSA continued to align the interests of both Synchrony and our partners, and we maintained our cost discipline to deliver fourth quarter net earnings of $774 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.6%, and a return on tangible common equity of 23%. These fourth quarter results enabled a strong close to 2024, during which Synchrony acquired almost 20 million new accounts and financed more than $182 billion of purchase volume. This year marked our second highest level of purchase volume and serves as an important testament to the lasting appeal of our diverse and flexible financing solutions and compelling value propositions that we offer. Synchrony deeply understands the needs of our many stakeholders. And so even as customers became more discerning in their spending choices and the impacts of persistent inflation and our credit actions took hold as the year progressed. Synchrony leveraged our scale, our data analytics, and deep lending expertise, and our advanced digital capabilities to remain nimble and responsive in a rapidly changing environment. As a result, Synchrony generated full-year 2024 net earnings of $3.5 billion or $8.55 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.9%, and a return on tangible common equity of 27.5%. The financial performance included both the positive and adverse impacts of several non-recurring events in our business, ranging from the sale of one business and the acquisition of another to the undertaking of an unprecedented, multi-phase plan to prepare for a potential regulatory change with far-reaching implications for the consumer lending industry. And yet, through all the complexities of these opportunities and amidst an ever-evolving landscape, Synchrony executed at a high level across all our key strategic priorities to optimize our business and position us for sustainable growth at strong risk-adjusted returns for the long-term. During 2024, we added more than 45 new partners, including iconic brands like Virgin, Gibson, and BRP, as well as technology-oriented relationships like Adit Practice Management Software and ServiceTitan. Each of these additions further diversified the industries, products, and services for which Synchrony can provide flexible financing solutions, while also extending our customer reach. Synchrony also grew and expanded existing partnerships during the year with the renewal of more than 45 programs, including Verizon and Generac, and more recently two of our top five partners, Sam's Club and JCPenney. We're excited to announce that in January we renewed and extended our more than 30-year relationship with Sam's Club, which builds upon our strong focus of delivering member-centric digital experiences and value. Synchrony's partnership with JCPenney has also evolved over nearly 25-years through both collaboration and innovation as our customers' needs have changed. Our long-term program extension and expansion will now include the introduction of Synchrony Pay Later, Our buy now pay later financing solution with six, 12 or 24 month installment payments. Customers can scan a QR code in store to complete an application on their own device. And if approved, select their preferred financing option and make their purchase immediately. And just as Synchrony is evolving and expanding the ways in which we deliver value through partner programs we offer, we are also focused on diversifying the programs and markets we serve and the breadth and utility of the products we offer. In 2024, we completed the acquisition of the Ally lending business and are in the process of transitioning merchants to Synchrony pay later. We're excited to continue further developing our multi-product capabilities and continue the expanded integration of this vertical in 2025. We also finalized the sale of Pets Best to Independence Pet Holdings, and in addition to a significant financial gain, we extended our reach in the rapidly growing pet industry through an equity interest in IPH. We're excited about the recent launch of Better Together with CareCredit and Pets Best, a patent-pending, simple, and seamless innovation that connects the two solutions by directly reimbursing insurance claims to the CareCredit Health and Wellness Card. We believe this streamlined payment process will deliver a unified experience for Pet parents and support our growth in the Pet care financing industry. And we launched CareCredit into wellness markets to finance fertility, nutrition, and dietitian products and services, which supported almost 15% growth in wellness-related purchase volume during 2024. In addition, Synchrony enhanced the utility of a number of our private label credit cards by broadening their acceptance and expanding their distribution channels, an evolution made possible by the delivery of our financial ecosystem through more of our merchant-acquire partners. For example, the Amazon store card can now be used at all Whole Foods locations via mobile QR code and for one medical membership. The results have exceeded expectations and build upon our strong foundation of acceptance, including Amazon.com, Amazon Pay, and Audible. In addition, CareCredit can now be used to pay for select health and wellness products and services across a growing list of approximately 18,000 retail acceptance locations, including Albertsons Companies, Sam's Club, Walgreens, and Walmart. And in keeping with our strategy of broadening product utility, we continue to roll out our CareCredit dual card over the past year, which grew open accounts by 16%. Thanks to its strong value proposition and utility, about 60% of this product's out-of-partner spend in 2024 was outside of traditional health and wellness categories. Today Synchrony delivers a wide variety of innovative financing products and services that are designed to responsibly address each customer's needs whenever and however they are looking to make a purchase. An opportunity that is increasingly occurring digitally, whether that's on a mobile device or at the physical point of sale through wallet apps and digital payments. Throughout the past year, Synchrony has been on a journey to bring our customer experience to life through more engaging and cohesive content across our digital footprint. From our native apps to our marketplace and website, we're expanding and deepening the role that Synchrony plays with our customers and partner relationships. In fact, through our efforts to expand Synchrony's digital presence, we've enhanced our cross-marketing capabilities and strengthened partner and product awareness for our customers. We're also seeing customers engage with Synchrony more extensively, visiting our sites more often. And while they're engaging longer on our properties, this engagement has contributed to incremental new accounts and sales, as well as lower acquisition costs. In the case of Synchrony Bank, we've more than doubled the number of new Synchrony Bank accounts acquired through our synchrony.com website with almost no associated acquisition cost. And thanks to the combination of our dynamic technology platform, our advanced analytics, and our scale, with more than 140 million reported trade lines and trillions of customer and spend data points, we can leverage proprietary insights throughout our digital financial ecosystem and across the customer journey to deliver highly personalized and engaging experiences. Synchrony's marketplace is a growing part of that financial ecosystem and drives greater connectedness between our customers and partners. Over the last year, we've launched curated campaigns and differentiated offers through our marketplace that contributed to more than 600 million impressions and 1 million referrals across participating partners. In addition, marketplace hosted almost 228 million customer visits and drove more than 17% growth in newly submitted applications within marketplace. Synchrony's digital wallet strategy also made great strides in 2024, driving stronger engagement, utility, and purchasing power for our customers. In fact, Synchrony's unique active wallet users grew 85%, compared to 2023 and contributed to more than double the digital wallet sales in 2024. This growth also supported a more than 200 basis point improvement in our dual and co-brand cards wallet penetration rate. We should enhance the stickiness of these products and provide natural tailwinds to Synchrony's mobile wallet share as we continue to invest in this strategy. We're also excited by the opportunities we see to drive our digital penetration further in 2025. This includes our recent announcement that eligible Synchrony MasterCard holders can now choose to pay with the standard terms of their credit card or use a promotional offer that includes fixed monthly payments when checking out with Apple Pay Online and in-app on an iPhone or an iPad. This enhances the way users pay and provides them with more choice and flexibility. And we plan to expand on this Apple Pay integration even further later this year by bringing users the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony issue cards. Synchrony also plans to work with our Apple Pay enabled partners to expand this capability across our portfolio. And if Synchrony continues to innovate and drive still greater financing experience and value for all those we serve, we're maintaining our discipline and leveraging our core strengths to sustainably grow and deepen our leadership position. Our sophisticated approach to customer lifetime value is driving incremental and deeper connections between approximately 70 million customers and hundreds of thousands of partners, providers, and small and mid-sized businesses that we serve. Our diversified portfolio of products, programs, and spend categories is empowering our customers with financing flexibility in whatever moment of life they're in. Our expansive distribution channels and omni-channel capabilities are increasingly delivering our financial ecosystem anywhere a purchase can be made. And our differentiated approach to underwriting and credit management is driving the stability of our portfolios post-pandemic credit performance compared to most other lenders in the industry. All of this is that made possible with an incredible team of people and culture that earned Synchrony the honor of being ranked fifth among best companies to work for in the U.S. by Fortune magazine and great places to work in 2024. So as we look to 2025 and beyond, Synchrony is operating from a position of strength. We're executing across our key strategic priorities, empowering strong outcomes for the many stakeholders we serve. We're deepening our role within the heart of American commerce and priming our business for profitable growth for years to come. And we're driving considerable long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony\u2019s fourth quarter performance reflected the inherent resilience that comes from our diversified portfolio products and spend categories, our balanced approach to underwriting and credit management, and our sophisticated technology platform. This differentiated combination of strengths enable our business to swiftly adapt to the evolving landscape. During the fourth quarter, customers continue to seek out our flexible financing solutions, has a strong value proposition, and broad utility of our product offerings generate lasting value against a persistently inflationary environment. As a result, we added 5 million new accounts, maintained approximately 70 million active accounts, and generated $48 billion of purchase volume despite the continued impact of the credit actions we took between mid-2023 and early 2024. Any receivables grew 2% to $105 billion as payment rates continued to moderate down approximately 10 basis points, compared to last year. Purchase volume and receivables at the platform level reflected the continuation of the trends we discussed over the course of the year as customers remain selective in their spending behavior and generally prioritize non-discretionary and seasonal holiday items. Platform purchase volume growth ranged between down 1% and down 6% year-over-year, generally reflecting the lower spend per account as customers moderate both bigger ticket and discretionary spend, particularly in categories like furniture, electronics, cosmetic, and outdoor, as well as the impact of Synchrony\u2019s credit actions. Receivable growth across the platforms range from flat to 6% higher year-over-year, primarily due to slower purchase volume growth and payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 44% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 1%, reflecting the benefit of these products' broad-based utility offset by the combined impacts of selective customer spend and Synchrony\u2019s credit actions. Net revenue grew 4% to $3.8 billion, resulting from higher interest and fees and higher other income, partially offset by higher RSA and interest expense. Net interest income increased 3% to $4.6 billion as interest and fees grew 3%, primarily reflecting higher interest and fees on loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense from higher interest-bearing liabilities. Our loan receivables yield grew 8 basis points, primarily driven by our pricing actions, including the impact of our product, pricing, and policy changes, or PPPCs, as well as the lower payment rate, partially offset by higher reversals and a lower lay fee incidence. Total interest-bearing liabilities cost was 4.58%, an increase of 3 basis points versus last year. RSAs of $919 million were 3.57% of average loan receivables in the fourth quarter, and increased $41 million versus the prior year, primarily reflecting program performance, which includes the impact of our PPPCs. Other income increased $128 million, primarily related to the impact of our PPPC-related fees, which were partially offset by the impact of our Pets Best disposition. Provision for credit losses decreased to $1.6 billion, primarily reflecting a $100 million reserve lease in the fourth quarter, compared to a reserve build of $402 million in the prior year, partially offset by higher net charge-offs. Other expenses decreased 4% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by the prior year restructuring costs and other notable expenses as outlined on slide 17 of earnings presentation and lower operational losses in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by costs related to the Ally lending acquisition and technology investments. The efficiency ratio was 33.3% for the fourth quarter, an improvement of approximately 270 basis points versus last year, reflecting a combination of Synchrony's cost discipline and revenue growth. Taken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $774 million or $1.91 per diluted share and delivered a return on average assets of 2.6%, a return on tangible common equity of 23%, and a 23% increase in tangible book value per share. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 11. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.70%, a decline of 4 basis points from 4.74% in the prior year, and 8 basis points above our historical average from the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.40%, an increase of 12 basis points from 2.28% in the prior year and 16 basis points above our historical average from the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge off rate was 6.45% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 87 basis points from 5.58% in the prior year and 96 basis points above our historical average from the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.44%, which decreased approximately 35 basis points from the 10.79% in the third quarter. As shown on slide 12, the credit actions we've taken from mid-2023 through early 2024 are improving our delinquency formation as the rate of year-over-year growth in both 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates continue to decelerate. These trends give us confidence in our ability to return to our long-term net charge-off target. Turning to slide 13, Synchrony's funding, capital, and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. During the fourth quarter, Synchrony grew our direct deposits by approximately $716 million and reduced our broker deposits by $938 million. At quarter end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding, with secured and unsecured debt, each representing 8% of total funding respectively. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $19.8 billion, essentially flat versus last year, and represented 16.6% of total assets, a 26 basis point decrease from last year. Focusing on our capital ratios, as a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. I think we will make a final transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025, which will reflect the fully phased-in effects of CECL. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%, 110 basis points higher than last year's 12.2%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5%, 160 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 160 basis points to 16.5%. In our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio, on a fully phased-in basis increased to 24.3%, compared to 22.1% last year. Synchrony returned $197 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter, consisting of $100 million in share repurchases and $97 million in common stock dividends, totaling $1.4 billion of capital returned during the full-year 2024. At year-end, we had $600 million remaining in our share of purchase authorization for the period ending June 30, 2025. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan. Turning to our outlook for 2025 on slide 14. Our baseline assumptions include a stable macroeconomic environment, full-year GDP growth of 2.2%, a year-end employment rate of 4.1%, a year-end fed funds rate of 4.25%, full-year deposit betas of approximately 60%. In addition, given the uncertainty with regard to the litigation process and the political landscape surrounding the late fee rule, our outlook assumes no impact in the potential late fee rule change, but does include the impact of our PPPCs. If the late fee rule were to go into effect, this outlook would no longer be applicable. Starting with ending loan receivables, we expect purchase volume and new account growth to continue to reflect the impacts of our credit actions and selective customer spend behavior. We also expect payment rates in 2025 to generally remain flat with 2024 levels as a result of our past credit actions, which have stabilized the mix of customer payment behaviors. As a result, we expect low-single-digit growth ending loan receivables for the full-year 2025. We expect net revenue for the full-year to be between $15.2 and $15.7 billion and to follow seasonal trends. We expect year-over-year growth in both interest income and other income as the impact of our PPPC's build, partially offset by the flow through of lower average prime rate on our variable rate receivables, lower late fees as delinquency performance improves, lower yielding investment portfolio due to lower benchmark rates, and finance charge and late fee reversals associated with the seasonality of our credit performance. Lower average benchmark rates should also contribute to lower funding costs as our CD maturities reprice, although this will be influenced by competitive deposit beta trends in response to any additional rate cuts that may occur. In addition, we generally expect to maintain higher levels of liquidity of approximately 17% for the next few quarters, given our desire to prioritize our deposit-customer relationships and pre-fund future growth. Finally, RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables should be between 3.60% and 3.85%, driven by improving program performance as net charge-offs decline and the impact of our PPPCs increase. We expect our portfolio net charge-off rate for the full-year to be between 5.8% and 6.1%, primarily reflecting the benefit of our prior credit actions and our differentiated approach to underwriting and credit management. And we expect our efficiency ratio to be between 31.5% and 32.5% as Synchrony remains focused on driving operating leverage in our business. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's discussion. First, Synchrony is well positioned to reaccelerate our growth. Our investments we've made and credit actions we've taken were designed to prioritize sustainable, profitable growth through evolving market conditions. Our performance since exiting the pandemic in 2021 demonstrates our discipline with average ending loan receivables growth of approximately 9%, while delivering an average return on assets of approximately 3%, an average return on tangible common equity of approximately 25%. Second, the outperformance of our portfolio's credit trends relative to the industry has enabled this track record, and our recent delinquency formation trends give us confidence in both our credit outlook and our ability to reaccelerate profitable growth. We are watching for continued stability in the macro environment, more confident consumer spend behavior, and continued improvement in our delinquency performance to support the gradual reversal of our credit restrictions. And third, Synchrony's robust capital position is a clear strength. It will enable our growth while also supporting greater capital returns to our shareholders in the years ahead. In summary, Synchrony's high-level execution in 2024 has positioned us well for 2025 and beyond as we drive progress towards our long-term financial targets. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A. Kathryn Miller : That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, everyone. Brian Wenzel : Hey, Ryan. Brian Doubles : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So maybe to start off on the net revenue guide, Brian, you talked about growth in both fees and NII. Can we maybe just dig in on some of the moving pieces on net interest income? And I guess, first, how do we think about the impact from rates? I know you're targeting 4.25% in terms of Fed funds. The balance sheet should benefit as rates come down? And then second, how is the impact of the PPPCs coming through on your guide? How much of the full benefit that you were anticipating is already incorporated into the run rate for this year? And then I have a follow-up. Brian Doubles : Yes, great. Let me try to unpack a little bit of that, Ryan. So I think when you think about net revenue guide and I'll bridge you a little bit to NII, when you think about the net revenue guy, you're going to get a significant increase related to the PPP fees running through net revenue. You'll also get a lift coming from growth and revolver rate coming through here. But there are two fairly large offsets that are coming back. One, is RSAs, which has the effect not only from a lower net charge-off rate in 2025, but also has the effect of the PPPCs that are flowing through there. And you have a fairly significant drop in late fee revenue that comes through there as well as your charge-offs decline. So those are the general moving pieces. You will see a more pronounced NII growth, because obviously that strips out the RSA impact, but the same weight fee dynamic, the revolve rate, all those kind of flow through. On net funding, it's slightly negative for the full-year. It's more a timing of when we have the rate cut kind of coming through. Prime rate already starting to drop this beginning part of this year. So it's more of timing, to be honest with you, when you think about prime rate decline, the investment portfolio, which resets fairly quickly, and then the funding piece again depending upon when the CD maturities restack. So again, more pronounced NII growth and the PPPCs, you know, I'll get ahead of the question, are performing generally in line with financially our expectations. You know, we have said there's a little bit of mix where we're getting stronger retention, stronger yield on the interest side and a little bit lighter on the paper statement fees, mainly due to people adopting E-Bill. So that's how I kind of think about the framework for both net revenue and NII. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe as a follow-up on capital, so you're sitting over 200 bps above the target, especially in a seasonally low quarter, and I think you brought back $100 billion of stock. Can you maybe just talk about the plan for capital return, particularly why it was a little bit depressed in the quarter? And maybe just toggle between, are you seeing more opportunities to deploy it inorganically, or I know you mentioned twice in your last remarks, Brian, about the re-acceleration of growth. Are you holding back a little bit in terms of anticipating the return of long growth? Just trying to understand the thought process on the lower near-term buyback and what it means for deploying capital over the next few quarters? Brian Doubles : Yes, thanks for that question, Ryan. I know a lot of people are going to try to make a read through into what we did and the cadence for the quarter. I just want to be clear, the cadence for the quarter being lower than some of the prior quarters was more our kind of view on the market and what was going to be potentially a more volatile market given the presidential election and the aftermath of whichever an administration kind of came through and the flow through effects. So we kind of predetermined that, that wasn't a quarter that we were going to be heavily leaning in from a buyback perspective. I would not read through that. You know, the $600 million that we have remaining on the current authorization, our intention is to complete that. And right now we're in the process of completing our 2025 capital plan, running our loss stress tests for there. And again, we understand that capital is a strength for us. It does provide us the opportunity to do things integrally, but I want to be clear, we didn't build capital or the lower repurchases, but not due to waiting for additional growth, AV and organic. It was just more, you know, our kind of view of the markets may be a little bit more disrupted or disjointed in the fourth quarter. And we remain committed to bring capital back down, you know, closer to our target. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Ryan. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. Brian Wenzel, maybe just to drill into that PPPC impact a little bit more. Is it fair to assume that by the end of this year you'd still sort of have that full run rate of what you anticipated putting in as mitigation in the numbers? And I guess, like, you know, how should we think about if late-fee regulation doesn't happen? How would it impact the ROA? I'm just trying to think about, you know, sort of normalize your long-term ROA and when you anticipate getting there? And I would have thought that mitigation takes that higher and sort of when we might get there? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. Good morning. As I think about how you exit out of 2025 on the PPPCs, if I look at a couple of different components, they're still not going to be fully there on the financial charges. If you recall, we said, you know, you're roughly, you know, half, you know, one year out, you're about 35% two years out. So there's going to be incremental one rate to go on the interest line as you exit out of \u201825 and get closer into \u201926, that's number one. Paper statements should reach, I'd say, a steady or state level, but then will grow rate relative to our average active accounts and how that grows depending upon mix and when not all the accounts have that paper statement. So, you know, potentially there could be a little bit of headwind if more people choose e-bill and then you're going to get the benefit down on the expense line versus the other income line. And the last thing I'd say is on the promotional fees, that should build throughout 2025, because that's something I want to affect a little bit later in 2024 as promotional volume picks up. It's been a little bit below our historical amounts, right, just on a buying perspective. That should pick up and advertise in over time. So I think as you exit out of \u201825, there still is room to grow up, you know, grow both on the interest line from promo fees and interest income, interest from the interest charges, and a little bit on the paper statement fees. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then as far as ROAs, any thoughts there? Brian Wenzel : You know, we're obviously not, we're not dying to an ROA, but if you look at the construct of the outlook, in theory, you know, coming from a place where you need to strip out this year, it's really important to strip out the Pets Best gain and the Visa B gain, you know, in theory, the PPPCs without a late fee offset or lower late fees, you generally should have something that would drive the ROA incrementally higher. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Okay. Just one follow-up for Brian Doubles. Maybe you could talk about the deal environment. I know there's a couple of RFPs out there? There's a lot of chatter around those. Maybe you just talk about how it's looking for you, and then, you know, the loan growth still remains weak. The purchase volume remains weak. I mean, anything that can help drive that? Are you guys being conservative there? Thanks. Brian Doubles : Yes, sure. Look, I would say generally we like the operating environment right now. You know, I'll start with your second question, which is just around growth. I think with the consumer is in pretty good shape. We like the environment right now. We did take some credit actions. You're seeing those work exactly as designed. So you saw 30-plus turn the corner. The setup for next year is really good. So we feel great about the environment. I'll tell you on the competitive side, there's still pretty good discipline in the market. We're looking at a lot of new opportunities as we always do. We have a robust pipeline. And at this point, there's still pretty good discipline. I think some of that is coming out of, you know, last year was a little bit uncertain in terms of, you know, the economy, the effects of inflation, the election. And I think when you're in periods like that, you tend to see pretty good discipline around pricing new opportunities, and we're seeing that. So as you know, we're a disciplined bidder. We're always focused on a good risk-adjusted return. We look for programs where we have really strong alignment between us and the partner. Like those things are critical. Those are absolutely non-negotiables for us. And we continue to win new business. So I feel, again, I feel good about the environment. I feel really good about how we're competing for new business. And you actually saw that with a couple big renewals that we did this past quarter with Sam's and JCPenney. Brian Wenzel : Yes, Sanjay, if could just add one point of clarity for what Brian said. You know, when you look at the purchase line growth in the fourth quarter, I know people are focused on that. A significant portion of that was credit action driven. That was us really trying to focus to get credit into the position in 2025 where we're getting back into our longer term, long-term target range. And that's really important. And I know we'll get the credit at some point, but it's also helping us get back on a trajectory faster than our peers. But the purchase volume is by design. The new accounts were by design to kind of set us up, you know, really on the credit side. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Sanjay. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you for taking my questions. I actually wanted to go back to the question around just the net revenue and some of the components there? Maybe just talk about some of the assumptions embedded in there in terms of just how much of your portfolio is resized heading into 2025? What do you expect heading out of 2025? Does that imply like, you know even more upside on net revenue in 2026? Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Yes, again, we haven't really changed or provided any incremental color here other than we talked about how much of the book should reprice in the first 12-months and in the next 12-months. I'd say we're slightly ahead of that schedule as we stand now. Obviously, we're also going into a period where prime rates going to have a little bit of an influence here in the first-half, given the changes that happened in the latter part of 2024. So again, there's no change to the guides that we add with regard to how much of the book is going to be on the new APRs. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just like you mentioned credit, so let's turn to that. Your outlook does suggest meaningful improvement, and we see that in the delinquencies. But I was curious about how you would carry, but your purchase volumes are still pressured. I understand some of it is driven by your own actions and pulling back on tightening underwriting. So I guess a couple of questions there is just, are you done with tightening underwriting for now? How do you feel about the environment currently? What are you seeing from the consumer? Some others have mentioned an increase in people paying minimum balances, some commentary around how many people are at their full credit limits. What are you seeing in your book? How do you feel about the consumer? And where are you from underwriting, posture standpoint? Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes. Let me try to unpack that one here. You know, the first thing, you know, I want people to focus on the fact that we were later in the credit normalization than others. We reached what, you know, if you could say a peak or a trend where our 30-plus has now turned positive, whether you think about it sequentially to the third quarter or year-over-year in the fourth quarter, where a lot of other people are doing it. So we didn't go with high, and ours was much more compressed, largely due to the credit actions that we've taken, and we're pleased with how they're performing. The broad-based actions that we took really, I'd say, seized back in the second quarter of 2024. So the actions that we continue to take are the standard idiosyncratic type refinements that we look at partners, channels, as we look at the risk return of those channels and products. As we enter into 2025, I think when you look at that credit trajectory, and we've outperformed seasonality now for five months on a 17 to 19 basis, I think we feel optimistic where we are going with credit and the performance of those actions, which gives us a guide down again to that 5.8% to 6.10% range. Some of that is going to be more dependent upon the denominator. When you go underneath the hood and you start thinking about the consumer for a second, overall line utilization has not really changed. So we don't see consumers at max in line. So that's not an issue that we see in our portfolio or segments of our portfolio. When we look at payment behavioral patterns, when we see movements, we are seeing movements generally across all credit grades. So it's not centered around non-prime. We see probably a little bit more in the upper prime category than the low prime, which means they're kind of coming back from some place where they had excess liquidity. But we don't see anything that's really different. You know, if you look at our payment composition, right, relative to 2019, people who are making the minimum payment is up significantly from 2019 across all credit grades. And so you look at the, you know, 780 plus, they're up probably a little over 400 basis points. Every other credit grade, whether it's the prime, the non-prime, we're up 3s. It's not materially different. Part of that is structural, right, as we put more installment lending in and promotional financing. All those payments go into exact NIM pay. So that's kind of structural. So we don't see cracks in the consumer design. I talked about payment behavior patterns, line utilization patterns. We continue to believe that a lot of loss pressure across the industry was too much credit being put out for certain cohorts and their ability to really handle that credit. So we don't see things that are troubling to us. And I think as we step through the first-half of the year, I think we'll take an assessment back on whether or not, at what point do we want to potentially lift some of the credit restrictions that are in place. You know, there could be a scenario where you do some of that in the back half of this year. I wouldn't say, you know, I wouldn't say there's a scenario where we reverse everything. But there could be, you know, a reason for us to sit back and say the actions have largely fulfilled what they needed to do in order to get the book in the right place. So that's how I think about credit and some of the performance of the book today in here. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Terry Ma with Barclays. Please go ahead. Terry Ma : Hey, thank you. Good morning. Maybe as a follow-up to credit, your delinquency rate was down 4 basis points year-over-year. Do you have any sense for how much additional room there could be for improvement on a year-over-year basis as we progress through the rest of the year? Brian Doubles : Yes, thank you and good morning, Terry. So we don't forecast 30-plus, 90-plus externally. What I'd sit back and give you maybe color on is some of the trends that we do see in credit, which obviously informs not only the charge-off rate, but where we go from a reserving standpoint. We continue to see entry rate favorability. That again, accelerated a little bit more in the fourth quarter for some actions we've taken pre-collections. We've seen good performance relative in our two flows to charge-off. And really our late stage collections have improved. So I think as you look at that, that gives us a really high confidence level as we think about getting the charge-off rate down year-over-year and back into our target underwriting zone. I think if you think about the short-term nature here, obviously there's generally a seasonal lift that you see particularly in the first quarter and going, you know, go on from there. We will not see as much of a seasonal lift to traditionally it's been around 50 basis points. We will not experience that in the first quarter 2025 or belief mainly for two things : one, is that performance I talked about particularly late stage improvement across some of those later delinquency stage is, number one, and two, the timing of certain recovery actions we have, why recoveries are going to be, you know, on par with how you think about 2024, just the timing of that plays through. So a little bit better seasonally in the first-half, or first quarter, excuse me. So we feel good based on that delinquency formation of flow. Terry Ma : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up on the allowance ratio, if you put all that together, what does that mean for the allowance ratio as we kind of progress through the rest of this year? I think this quarter ended up a little bit higher than what you had kind of guided to earlier in the year. So maybe any color on the delta between the guide versus the realize? And then how we should think about the allowance ratio? Brian Doubles : Yes, thanks for that question. So let me try to address a little bit of the ending point in 2024. I think there's really two factors that kind of have gone into that ending point being. Maybe higher than other people expected or generally we said it'd be fairly in line with our exit point in 2023. Number one, the denominator clearly had some influence to being slightly higher on a rate basis, so that's part of it. The second piece of it probably is a little bit of what I would say conservatism, how we think about the credit actions inside the quantitative part of the model as we enter 2025. I think if you take a step back while we're not providing guidance on the reserve, but think about the components here, if you continue to believe or believe that the net charge-off rate comes back down closer to that or inside of the net charge off long-term guide, right, that part of the model, which is the quantitative part of the model, you should be able to get a rate benefit coming off of that. The second piece of it is your qualitative overlays and whether or not you get clarity on the macroeconomic environment, right, which today continues to be, you know, an ebbs and flows on how inflation is trending and how interest rates are flooding. But those two are the pieces that we're going to have to watch. Inherently, I think if you think about a charge-off rate for declining and you think of a macroeconomic environment that improves and you have greater clarity, there would be a downward bias as you move into 2025 and exit out of 2025 on the reserve rate. Again, you'll be subject to a little bit of the seasonality throughout the year, but there should be a downward bias under that type of scenario or framework. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Brian Doubles, you mentioned that part of the JCPenney renewal was the addition of the Synchrony pay later. Could you talk about the other, any other sort of, you know, new aspects to the renewals for those two large programs and just talk a little bit about how we should think about the economics of those renewals? Thank you. Brian Doubles : Yes, Moshe. So look, I would say first we're thrilled to have renewed JCPenney and Sam's Club. You know, we've been with both partners for decades now at this point, so we're extremely happy to have them renewed. We're excited to launch pay later with JCPenney. I think it's a real testament to the multi-product ecosystem that we've built, you know, starting with Lowe's, now JCPenney, it's really resonating with our partners, both, frankly, both on the renewal side, but also as we go out and compete with new -- compete for a new business. And I think it's different than it was probably two or three years ago where you had partners that were leveraging FinTech\u2019s, looking for buy now, pay later solutions. They were basically doing anything they could to generate and drive sales. Now they've kind of taken a step back and they said, hey, you know, we want a product that can be a starter product, a way to bring in new customers, and then over time, graduate them to a revolving product, a co-brand card, and when you look at the economic model associated with that, it's really compelling. It's great for us, it's great for the partners, because some of the starter products in buy now, pay later don't exactly meet our return threshold, but when you look at the lifetime value of that customer, it absolutely does. And like I said, it benefits us and the partner. In terms of the two renewals on economics, we don't get into that. I would just tell you that we're extremely happy with both the economics and the terms of both agreements. We've got great alignment on both. I talk about that a lot because it's absolutely critical to have a successful program. These are long-term agreements and you want to make sure that the interest between us and the partner is perfectly aligned and in both cases I think they are. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it, thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, you talked a little bit about the potential for some degree of reversal of some of the tightening\u2019s, perhaps, by the second-half of the year. Just talk a little bit more granularly about whether there are certain types of, maybe not names of partners, but types of partners that you'd likely see that first or any other kind of signs that we should be looking forward to, you know, to see that that's going on? Brian Doubles : Yes, so great question, Moshe. I think what you're going to start to see is in a couple areas, right? We'll see an acceleration potentially of dual card, right? So that we're having dual cards as you potentially would think about where we may be down selling a little bit more in a private label today, we would go through and do more upgrades from the private label product into the dual-card products, that's one. I think in two, an area you'll see is where we have probably been more restrictive on credit line increases and potentially credit line decreases, you'll see probably a little bit more credit line increase activity and decrease activity and that generally will happen in some of the larger balance type platforms that we have. So I think initially what you'll start to see is really some expansion into growth areas, some improvement on our approval rate in new accounts that then begins to flow through on the purchase find activity. Again, I think centered in a little bit of the larger type balance platforms. I think another big component here is going to be when the consumer has enough confidence, we watch consumer confidence quite closely, but has enough confidence where they want to make more discretionary purchases, because that's what we're seeing across the board, where it's in health and wellness, you think about some of the cosmetic or Lasik potentially when you think about in home and auto, some of the mattresses and furniture deferrals. Those should create nice tailwinds when the consumer gets some confidence as we step through they're noncredit oriented, but we'll be there to help them. So I do think it's a little bit broader on some of the actions that we would take or begin to unwind under that potential scenario. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks so much. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Moshe. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Adelson : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Doubles : Hi, Jeff. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Adelson : Just given the broader slowing growth of purchase volumes and account growth you've seen for a few years now and the credit actions you've taken, can you maybe share some of the feedback and conversations you're having with your key retail partners around that? I understand that Synchrony controls the underwriting, but are you hearing more of a desire from some of these partners to maybe lean back in a little bit here? And how is that talking point of slower growth narrative maybe feeding into the competitive dynamic as you look to really renew and win new partnerships from here? Brian Doubles : Yes. Jeff, I think it comes back to what I said earlier, which is all of our programs, we have really good alignment with the partners. So when we saw what the industry did in \u201821, \u201822, a little bit into \u201823 and the massive amount of credit that was extended to consumers, we started very proactively making some of these tightening actions and modifications. And we did that completely transparently with all of our partners, just like we do on everything related to the program. We look at the data, we look at the results. We show them exactly what it's going to do to the performance of the program, both on the growth side, but also on the RSA piece, and we make those decisions jointly. We control credit. There's no confusion about that, but we do it very transparently with our partners. And our interests are aligned through the RSA. And you're seeing that now. I mean, as Brian said, the RSA will come up a little bit, because of the PPPCs and the better net charge-offs profile for 2025. That's exactly how they're supposed to work. And so both the credit actions and the RSA are working as designed. And so in a partnership like this as long as you've got a good contract where it's very clear that we both win together. And don't be confused, we both want to grow. We want to improve more customers. We want to help our partners drive sales, but we want to do it in a prudent way where we're managing to the long-term credit target, and I think we're doing that. Brian Wenzel : Yes. The only thing I'd just add on to that, Jeff. I mean, just taking a little step back here, we did put up the second highest purchase volume ever as a company, coming off a record purchase volume in the year before. And we had significant asset growth the year before. So this is in -- I'd say, some long-term trend. This is by design of taking credit actions. That's why I think -- if you look at the pace at which losses start to accelerate and push through your long-term historical averages, we were probably the slowest to do that and one of the fastest coming back out, and we didn't have a steep an increase. That was because of credit actions and our desire to do that. So again, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that from a purchase line perspective, this is a significant year for our partners and for our company. Jeff Adelson : Okay, great. And as my follow-up, just maybe circle back on Sanjay's question. If the late fee regulation doesn't come out and let's just say the CFPB resends the rule, can you just talk about the plans from there? And have any of your retail partners talked about maybe a desire to pull back on some of the PPPC you put through? Brian Doubles : Yes. Look, I'll start on this. I think clearly, there's been some positive developments on the litigation front, the injunction will stay in place. I think Judge Pittman made some positive comments about the merits of the case for the industry. With all that said, nothing is final. We don't have certainty at this point. So we're not planning on making any changes to the pricing actions at this point. We got to see how the litigation progresses. We need some level of certainty. And like I said earlier, I think we'll do exactly what we did when the late fee proposal came out. We'll go out. We'll talk to our partners. We'll do that very transparently. We'll look at a number of different factors, including any behavioral changes that we may have seen up until this point, we'll look at where other merchants and providers are pricing their programs. We look at the competition. We look at the industry. And we'll go through the financial impact to our partners in terms of how it would impact the RSA. So again, it will be very collaborative. We'll make the decision together just like we've done on credit and when the first late fee proposal came out. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I guess, is just another, I guess, aspect of credit, Brian Wenzel, I know '24 is early, but is there any kind of early reads from some of the aspects of the '24 vintage that leads you to believe that it might -- that vintage itself might be performing within the long-term goals? Brian Wenzel : Yes. First of all, thanks for the question, John and good morning. As we look at the vintages in 2023 and 2024, we talked about some of the early performance very early, particularly for \u201924, I take back they continue to develop. And I'd say, as we look at those relative to the industry, they are performing better and the industry's experience on both \u201823 and \u201824 in our estimation. Those vintages when I compare them back to 2018 moved slightly worse than 2018, but nothing that's really significant or gives us pause as they develop. So I think as we look at it, we're very happy with those two vintages, between \u201824 vintages that have the full credit actions embedded in, and we feel optimistic as just another reason why we're back, hopefully, inside our long-term target range of by $550 million to $600 million, but in the guide of $580 million to $610 million for next year. John Hecht : Okay. And then Brian Doubles. Maybe can you talk about just the mix of digital commerce versus in-store commerce. And has that trajectory changed at all over the, I guess, kind of in the wake of COVID? Brian Doubles : Yes. John, not surprisingly, it continues to increase, both in terms of the type of partners where we're seeing the most growth at the moment. But also how the consumer is shopping. One of the big areas where we're investing is in digital wallets that are becoming more and more prevalent. We had the announcement of Apple Pay, which you saw. So that's an area where we continue to invest. I think we compete very well there. We have very sophisticated technology platforms that we embed into our partners' apps and their mobile platforms. And I think that's obviously -- I'm stating the outage that's where the future is going, and we've been investing there for eight or nine years really heavily. And so we feel good about that as a competitive advantage, I think we have a more sophisticated platform than any in the industry. John Hecht : Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Brian Wenzel : Thanks, John. Brian Double : Thanks, John. Have a good day. Operator : And we will move next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Brian Doubles : Hi, John. John Pancari : On the liquidity front, I know you mentioned you're running at higher levels of liquidity around 17%, partly to prefund growth. I mean, could you give maybe a little bit more color around this decision? And what could change this view? And what's the longer-term outlook? What would you say is the appropriate long-term liquidity level as you look out? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks for the question. As we look at the digital banking deposit market, we continue to think there's a place there with the consumers that we want to attract that there's still on track the way for us to get new customers. And what we did want to do was really shrink down deposit growth in the short-term only have to reaccelerate when growth comes in. Today, even on a higher liquidity on an EPS basis, it's a positive trade for me. If I can bring in dollars at a high-yield savings rate of $4.10 and collect over that, right, in Fed cash, that's a positive economic trade and positive EPS trade. Yes, it will certainly hurts net interest margin, but I think the EPS dollars makes more sense. What I want to do is pull back and try to be rate sensitive in the short-term and then have a higher cost to acquire in the back half of the year or into next year when we grow. So that's really the strategy around. I think we feel really that we're positioned well relative to who we define as our peers in the digital banking space. If you think about that long-term rate, it's generally in the, I'll call it, the 15% to 17% depending upon which quarter that you're in. So slightly lower than that from here, but we just wanted to call it out, because we're not going to alter our deposit funding strategy in the short-term, we believe the growth will reaccelerate at some point. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, Brian. And then my follow-up is a quick one, just back to the late fee rule. I heard you acknowledge the positive comments coming from Judge Pittman. But what are you actually hearing from your folks in D.C. post the election in terms of potential CFPB action as there's changes at the administration, I mean, could the rule be allowed the sorted out in the courts still or actually killed on the line? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. It's really hard to speculate on that. I mean, there are a number of different scenarios. We spent a lot of time with our legal team. I will tell you, just going back to when the litigation started, it has been a lot of ups and downs. And I think the industry feels fairly good about Judge Pittman\u2019s ruling, but how it could play out from here there's still a lot of uncertainty. I think the appeal window is still open until the first week of February. So I don't want to get into speculating. We're staying very close to it. Obviously, we're communicating with our partners, but I don't want to speculate beyond that. John Pancari : Okay, understand. Thank you. Brian Wenzel : Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Have a good day. Operator : And we will move next to Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. First, can you discuss the potential for PPPC to drive your normalized return profile of 28% sustainably higher? Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks and good morning, Bill. We haven't changed our long-term outlook. I think to some degree, once the late fee rule settles in, whether it goes in, it doesn't go in, what the ultimate effect of the PPPC are, we'll come back and potentially revisit those targets at that point, but we haven't changed them yet, Bill. Bill Carcache : Understood. Maybe following up on your efficiency guidance. Sorry if I missed this, but can you give us some color around the factors that would drive efficiency ratio towards the lower versus the higher end of the range? Brian Wenzel : Yes. One just goes back into how well you manage and grow your existing account population to the extent I can grow the existing balances I get operating leverage on that. I think we have a lot of discipline right relative to when and how we add incremental FTEs, and how we manage some of the nonexempt employees as we go through seasonal periods. So there's a number of different levers that we use. And we go back into the net revenue decline we saw as a company through the pandemic. We're very quickly back into being one of the more efficient, if not the most efficient credit card company when it comes down to how we operate the business, and that's our commitment is to drive that operating leverage again in 2025. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Phil. Have a good day. Operator : And we will move next to Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Question on the outlook for loan growth. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how that might progress through the year because I think in the past, you've talked about a scenario where you could open up a bit in the second-half. So is that still the base case and included in the outlook now? And then what are some of the waypoints we should watch to see if that remains on track? Is it just as simple as net charge-offs normalizing? Thanks. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Thanks and good morning, Rob. As you think about loan growth as you step through the year, you first got to look at against what you're comparing year-over-year. Obviously, the most difficult comp would be the first quarter. We were fairly clear in the second quarter, we saw a deceleration from the consumers that were really somewhat in advance of our credit actions. And then, obviously, the continued deceleration that you saw in the back half of the year, mainly from the credit acts themselves, as well as the discerning customers. So I think if you think about that, your first quarter is probably the more challenging one when it comes to loan growth. And then you should see it kind of accelerated as you step through second through the fourth quarters. With regard to the scenario that we potentially have talked about a couple of times around lifting some of the credit restrictions, that's not part of the base plan, it would be something that we would look at later in the year, and then you'll begin to see those effects as we take those actions. A good precursor to that is going to be how you see that charge-offs develop and whether or not we can deliver on the charge-off guidance, and we talked a little bit about the first quarter, but really getting back inside that range and feel comfortable that the trajectory and what we're originating is the rate risk adjusted margin, that's really the focal point for the company in which we would then begin to lift some of the restrictions where it's the latter part of this year or into next year. Rob Wildhack : Thanks. And then a quick clarification on deposits in betas. 60% beta for this year. I think this time last year, you were talking about an 80% or 90% beta on the way up and an expectation for something similar on the way down through the entire cutting cycle. So how you think about the 60% this year in the context of the 80%, 90% that you experienced on the way up? Brian Wenzel : Yes. So the way we think about betas up and definitionally, I think issuers or banks look at it slightly differently. We look at the start of the read-up cycle to the start of the downward cycle. So when I look at that, both for high-yield savings and CDs, that beta is around 75% when [174, 176] (ph). So that's really the guidepost. And ultimately, you're going to -- our view is you're going to get back to that same type of downer beta when you look at that first rate hike going forward, with 50% is more reflective, I think, of a little bit of lag that happens with digital banks and really the timing of the rate decrease. As you can see from our page, we only have 1 rate decrease in that's more towards the back half of the year. So given that lag, you don't see as much deposit beta during the current year. Rob Wildhack : Very helpful. Thank you. Brian Doubles : Thanks, Rob. Have a good day, guys. Operator : And we will move next to Vernon Crowley with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Brennan Crowley : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think most of my stuff has already been answered, but just -- you guys have mentioned a bit about the dual cards and the CareCredit dual card, driving new car growth. I'm just wondering if you guys could provide a little more color on your strategy here and what channels you're expecting to drive meaningful growth from? Brian Doubles : Yes, I'll take that. So look, I think the health and wellness business is one of our biggest strategic priorities. We've seen really good growth there, huge opportunities in front of us. One of the things that we looked at, just given the strong customer loyalty in the CareCredit product was offering a dual card. So one thing we've seen over the last 10-years is that consumers like to compartmentalize their health and wellness spend. And so the idea was, hey, if you love the CareCredit product, use it at pharmacies, use it for health and wellness spend. We've collaborated with some of our other partners to be able to accept the CareCredit card. And so it's an exciting growth trajectory for us. We love the product. We'll continue to invest there. Brennan Crowley : Great. Thanks, guys. Brian Wenzel : Thanks. Brian Doubles : Thanks. Have a good day. Operator : And we do have time for one last question. Our last question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi. Just one last question and just pulling up back to growth. I think the primary conversation that I was having with your investors really around the time you presented at a conference in December was on the growth trajectory? And I just wanted to make sure we were really unpacking all of the messages that you gave us today? So one is very clear, a lot of the slowdown in growth was from your -- from credit actions that you were proactive on. So I think that's pretty clear. You've mentioned that the consumer is in good shape, but the consumer is also not confident. So we kind of wanted to unpack what your cohort is really like in terms of how we're thinking about spending, because the data we've gotten across different cohorts, so far this earnings season has been pretty strong and the forward look has been pretty strong. And the third is, I'm actually going to ask the other question on the PPPC in that if we don't get late fees, I mean, in a way, does it really matter if it's ROE accretive, if it's going to be disincentivizing to growth, right? Like a purchase APR of 32% might be disincentivizing to grow. So those are just 3 things that I think investors are really considering as we think about what are the -- what does the growth look like for Synchrony specifically in your cohort as we think about a consumer. That's probably a little bit healthier than we thought they were going to be in '25? Brian Doubles : Yes. So let me start on the consumer. I think we -- look, we do feel good about the consumer. I think no matter what you're looking at, if you're looking at how they're spending, the fact that they're being disciplined, they're managing to a budget. We have seen a pullback in the lower income cohort, and I think that's pretty consistent across the industry. That's where they're feeling the effects of inflation. On the higher income customer, they're pulling back a little bit, but I think still very healthy. And I think that's good for -- from a credit perspective, people are being disciplined. They're not overextending, which is a good thing. So I think it's a combination of that and what we did on credit. And so we're very pleased with how the actions we took are performing, we're getting credit in line with the long-term guidance. And we're willing to sacrifice a little bit of growth here in the short-term to deliver that. Brian Wenzel : Yes. Erika, if I can add a couple of other points here. I think when you look at the overall consumer, when we look at that higher-end consumer, that hiring consumer for us was flat, right, for the quarter. So yes, it does trail, but it wasn't net negative, where we see more of the negativity down on the lower non-prime segment, which is the segment that attracted more of the credit actions. So again, when you unpack the pieces of it, we don't feel really bad about it. When you get to the PPPC, you bring up the concept around the APR and that. A couple of things I'd just add to that. Number one, for all the programs in which we executed PPPC, we have a test first control. So we actually can see purchase volume per active. We can see realization rate. We can see whether there is attrition, solid attrition or changes in revolver or transactor behaviors. And there's not a significant difference between the ones that are in the control group versus the ones that received the terms and conditions. So that gives us some level of comfort that the sales decline are not necessarily PPPC-oriented number one. Number two, there were a couple of holdouts that we have, while we may have agreed the terms haven\u2019t put in place, until [Indiscernible] went into place. In those situations, they're seeing some of the same declines that we're seeing across the board. So again, another data point that this isn't necessarily driven off of the PPPC. So as we look at that. And then the final point I\u2019d make, what people point to the APR, you have to look at the value proposition that these cards generally have a higher value proposition all in when you're looking at 5% discount in certain retailers or you're looking at 10% off and things like that. So a higher value proposition, which is a bulk of the RSAs, the gap is a great example of why you could have that thing kind of price. That's why someone can charge several hundred dollars for an annual fee in a card, because someone has believed that the value proposition is strong enough to support it. So I think you got to take a step back and look at all the elements around the pricing of the product and the value proposition before you draw conclusions. Brian Doubles : And that analysis is back to the point I made earlier, that's exactly what we sit down and go through with our partners. So we say, okay, here's the test. Here's the control. Here's what we think will happen if you move APRs up or down and what the trade-offs are. And obviously, our partners are very interested in that, because they're impacted, frankly, both on the growth side, as well as their interests are aligned through the RSA. Erika Najarian : Thanks. I think that was really helpful color for investors in terms of the control group anecdotes. So I appreciated that. Brian Doubles : Great. Thank you, Erica. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes Synchrony's earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you.",
